GT Computing Community
The Office of Outreach, Enrollment, and Community is poised to present another semester of awesome activities and endeavors for the 3,000 plus students that we serve. These programs are designed to complement the academic development that you’ll receive in the classroom. We are better equipped to serve you as we’ve acquired new tools during over COVID 19 experience. It’s also our sincere hope that your respective endeavors have an even bigger impact in the field on computing.
Life at the College of Computing isn’t just academic, professional, or social and Georgia Tech offers a wide variety of ways to get involved and find your path.
The College of Computing faculty and staff will walk with you from the first day of college through your graduation from Georgia Tech. We provide a community-minded atmosphere, where students can step in and out of offices for advice, ask a question, or just to hang out.
Be sure to also follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for more fun content!
YouTube is our main platform to share our resources across the College of Computing community. We post content that we hope you’ll find useful, whether it be a past yoga session, a quarantine edition of healthy eating, or shared experiences by students, for students.
GT Community Resources
Pet Therapy
Pet Therapy
Interacting with dogs is a great way to cope with the stress that comes with being a college student. To give our students and staff a fun way to relax, we bring dogs to the College of Computing twice a semester for people to pet and cuddle. Pet therapy is also great for cardiovascular assistance and has calming effects.
Coaching
Coaching
Leveraging our strengths is something we don’t do enough. Many students deal with imposter syndrome, feelings of doubt and belonging, when they step foot onto Tech’s campus. We work with you to help you take control of your academic, personal, and career path and realize your full potential.
Impact Program
Impact Program
The Impact through Science, Technology, and Social Good or Impact Living-Learning Community (LLC) is a LLC and initiative open to all first-year students who are interested in exploring issues of diversity and social good, community engagement, and sustainability.
GameFest
E-Sports
GameFest is another community-based initiative that’s gaining momentum in the college. We currently sponsor Gamefest LAN competitions twice a year in addition to sponsoring students that participate in competitions outside of the College of Computing.
Please be on the lookout for upcoming announcements as it pertains to GameFest and initiatives!
Resiliency Testimonials
Resiliency Testimonials
Georgia Tech students juggle schoolwork, research, jobs, internship hunting, clubs, sports, and more at the same time. We are a group of students who have a huge work ethic, but sometimes it can be overwhelming. At the end of their four years, students graduate with a diverse and impressive set of experiences that they can pass down to future students. We are interested in creating a collection of resiliency stories that could help others see past the tumulus work of the day or week – that the grass is indeed greener on the other side. If interested, please email Troy Peace at tpeace9@cc.gatech.edu
Self-Care
Self-Care
We are firm believers in taking care of ourselves here in the college. In order for you to begin interacting with others and making a difference, it is imperative that show yourself the attention that you deserve. We host a series of events that promote self-care in Klaus Atrium throughout the year where you can drop in, chat and relax with us, and grabs some snacks for the road!
Nutrition
Nutrition
Nutrition is an essential part of success for every student. Programs exist throughout every semester to give students advice and recommendations on how to eat healthy on a budget. The CoC partners with Health Initiatives at STAMPS to discuss these topics. Whether you are cooking for the first time or are a seasoned chef, there is always something new to learn.
Mental Health and Wellness
Mental Health and Wellness
Mental health is and remains a priority in the College of Computing, especially during this time. We have our in-house counselor Scott LaSalle located on the first floor of the College of Computing building. We also plan workshops and partner with Stamps Health Services to provide a safe space and facilitate the tough conversations around mental health. Finally, we believe that meditation is an excellent way to escape the hectic life of a Tech student. Join us for meditations to reduce stress, control anxiety, and enhance self-awareness
Transfer Chats
Transfer Chats
The transfer chats are a way for new and old transfers to engage with the community staff and other transfers in a way they might not have known. It is easy for many transfer students to miss a lot of the opportunities that are offered to them in the CoC and these discussions help to teach them the serves available as well as for them to get their voices heard by staff and discuss what things they want to see offered in the current semester and beyond.
Community Podcast
Community Podcast
The community podcast is a biweekly discussion with members of the Georgia Tech CoC community where individuals have an opportunity to tell their stories and speak about their experiences at Georgia Tech. Although the format is similar, the responses and stories from each person create a unique and human dialogue that serves to help those who sometimes feel isolated in difficult times.
Yoga
Yoga
College of Computing Yoga is a weekly aspect of the College of Computing Community. Each Friday we gather to unwind and decompress from the week’s activities. Classes are designed to be made for those who have a wide range of skill levels. Whether you have years of experience or no experience the hour-long practice will be time well spent.
