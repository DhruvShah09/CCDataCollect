Offer Acceptances & Student Guidelines
Career Services provides programs and services to support students with their individual professional pursuits. As a member of the College of Computing community, it is important to understand and abide by the Student Rights & Responsibilities defined by the Career Services program. We also ask that you engage in behavior that reflects a common set of values: scholarship, honesty, civility, accountability, caring, discovery, and celebration.
All currently enrolled College of Computing undergraduate, graduate students, and alumni (less than one year) are eligible to participate in campus recruiting, in-person & virtually.
-
GT Offer Guidelines - Communicate your acceptance or refusal of a job offer to employers as promptly as possible, so they can notify other candidates that they are still being considered or that the position is filled. If you need an extension, please request one from an employer. The Institute and the College of Computing use the same guidelines for offers extended to students for internships, co-ops, and full-time positions. Visit the GT Career Center to see the guidelines each semester.
-
Reneging on Offers - If you have accepted an offer and the employer has confirmed their offer, you should cease all job search activities. Reneging a job offer is a serious issue and should never be done lightly. The College of Computing has built relationships with our employers, and the actions of one student can affect that employer’s relationship with all other students. Most importantly, reneging always has a negative impact on peers who also applied to the same positions. It is ethically appropriate that if you have accepted an offer and the employer has confirmed your acceptance, you should cease all job search activities. Students who renege on an offer of employment will be subject to disciplinary action including loss of CoC Career Services opportunities including access to jobs board, CoC Career advising and workshops, and the College of Computing Career Fairs. Additional consequences may also be applied by the GT Career Center. Read the Student Interview Policy.
-
Misrepresentation - Misrepresentation of any information provided to an employer may result in immediate suspension of Career Center services and may result in reporting to the Office of Student Integrity.
