Vice President, Tech Operators
Biography
Patrick Taylor is an authority in the convergence of business analytics, information security and the implementation of technology to boost organizational performance. An innovator in his field, Patrick recognized that most IT-security and financial-system controls focus on user access and role management, but don't address how to convert ERP, CRM and other financial transaction resources into plain-language, actionable insights. This realization motivated Patrick to launch Oversight Systems, of which he is the current President & CEO. Oversight is unprecedented in its ability to use continuous transaction analysis in sync with predictive analytics to provide executives and business managers with clear, actionable insights from a sea of otherwise insurmountable data. Oversight Systems currently analyzes over $2 trillion of business transactions per year and continues to evolve its products and services to stay ahead of an ever-changing industry.
Previously, Patrick has held leading positions with many notable groups such as Internet Security Systems (ISS), Symantec, ORACLE, Red Brick Systems, GO, Air2Web and Fast-Talk. Patrick, an avid Jackets fan, holds a B.A. of Mechanical Engineering with Honors from Georgia Tech as well as an MBA from the Harvard Business School. He enjoys spending time with his wife, Margaret, and 5 children, one of which is currently a Georgia Tech undergrad.
