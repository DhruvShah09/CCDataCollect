Devices
Create devices embedded in physical objects that interact in the physical world.
The Devices thread is concerned with embedded computational artifacts that interact with people or the physical world. In this thread one learns how to create and evaluate devices that operate under physical constraints such as size, power and bandwidth. Examples include cell phones, robots, jet engines, and intelligent appliances.
The student who pursues Devices can combine it with Systems and Architecture to build devices that are small, power- and cpu-limited, with Intelligence to build autonomous robots, with People to study human-robot interaction, or a number of other threads.
