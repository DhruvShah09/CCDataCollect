Dual Degree Programs
Spend time abroad and earn two degrees!
The College of Computing provides our graduate students with the opportunity to study abroad and earn two Masters degrees - one from Georgia Tech and one from a partner European university through Georgia Tech-Europe (formerly Georgia Tech-Lorraine).
This innovative program provides students with the opportunity to earn two prestigious degrees - one from Georgia Tech, and one from one of our partner institutions. Students interested in this program do not need to speak French; many of our partner schools offer their programs in English. U.S. and other international students typically will spend their Fall and Spring semesters at GTE completing their MS requirements for Georgia Tech before moving on to the partner institution. Dual-degree students will have the option of completing a Masters thesis at the partner institution, or doing an internship.
