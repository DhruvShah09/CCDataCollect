Systems
For the below systems, students are expected to know the software: By experience, from readings, and if possible, preferably both.
These are the kinds of questions that we want you to be able to answer about these questions.
- Who is the user/student audience?
- What's the desired outcome from (and with) use of the software?
- Why do this system? What were the related predecessor systems? How is this system different?
- Were there unique technologies used here that weren't used previously?
- What evidence do we have about use of the system? About learning with the system?
- StarLogo
- Moose Crossing
- LBD/Smile
- Model-It!
- Symphony
- My World
- Genscope
