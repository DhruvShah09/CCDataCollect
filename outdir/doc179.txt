4. Where can I learn about the faculty’s research?
Visit our faculty profile pages to view a complete list of our professors and learn about their research interests and expertise
5. Based on the profile I e-mailed to you, am I eligible for admission?
We receive a large number of emails concerning admission to the graduate program. Profiles or information submitted through email for pre-review will not be evaluated by the Admissions Committee or academic advisors. A complete application package is necessary before the faculty can consider a student for admission The admissions committee will only review applications officially submitted through https://grad.gatech.edu/apply-now
6. I am interested in your MSCS program but I do not have a computer science degree. Can I still be considered for admission?
Yes, you will be considered for admission. We review applications holistically in order to determine applicant’s suitability. The admissions committee considers several factors when making admission decisions; academic performance at prior institutions (GPA), experience, background, GRE test scores, statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation. In general, we expect students who enter the program to be very comfortable working with multiple programming languages such as C, Java, and Python (there is no provision within the program for make-up any deficiencies) and to have taken several more advanced topics, such as Advanced OS, Networking, Theory, and/or Algorithms.
7. What can I do to be competitive? What do you recommend for applicants without a CS undergraduate background?
The following is what we recommend for applicants without a strong undergraduate background in computer science:
1. Must know how to program
2. C programming (proficient)
3. Java
4. Algorithms
You can gain this knowledge through undergrad classes, MOOC, or learn it through work experience.
8. What types of prerequisite courses?
The student should have an undergraduate level of proficiency in core computer science areas including operating systems, design and analysis of algorithms, formal languages and automata theory, networking and communications, theory/algorithms, and computer architecture. If any remedial coursework is needed, it will be assessed by our faculty and discussed with you during orientation.
9. My GRE score is below your minimum, can I still apply and be considered for admission?
You would not be automatically disqualified from consideration. Applicant scores are expected to be at least 153 in the Verbal, 155 in the Quantitative, and 3.0 in the Analytical sections for the MS program. We consider the strength of your overall application, including your educational and professional background, your performance at prior institutions (GPA), statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation. All of these factors are important, and your application will be strengthened if your GRE scores are at or above these average values. If your GRE scores are lower than these averages, your chances for admission will be reduced. You may retake the GRE, TOEFL, or IELTS to improve your score as many times as you wish. We will accept the highest score attained in each category.
10. My TOEFL is below the minimum, can I still apply and be considered for admission?
You are welcome to apply however, we generally do not accept applicants with less than 100 because most of our applicants exceed the minimum TOEFL. You may want to consider retaking the TOEFL.
11. Do you accept IELTS?
Beginning Spring 2020, we will accept IELTS in place of TOEFL. A minimum overall score of 7.5 is required, with minumum section scores as follows: Reading 6.5, Listening 6.5, Speaking 6.5, Writing 5.5.
12. What is the Department Code to request my GRE and TOEFL scores?
As long as you request the test from ETS using Institute Code 5248 we will receive the scores. When test scores are received from ETS and entered into Georgia Tech system, they are available for all degree programs to view.
13. What is the application deadline?
Students are admitted to the master’s program only once a year. The application deadline is February 1 for admission to the following fall semester.
14. When do you admit new students? What about Summer and Spring?
Students are admitted to the master’s program only once a year. The application deadline is February 1 for admission to the following fall semester. We do not admit for Summer or Spring.
15. I have a master’s degree (MSCS, or another degree). Can I still apply to your program?
Yes.
16. I completed a three-year bachelor’s degree. Am I eligible?
If you have a three-year bachelor's degree and a post bachelor's degree including the one-year postgraduate diploma, you should be eligible to matriculate as a degree-seeking student. The Office of Graduate Studies is the ultimate arbiter regarding whether or not a student can matriculate as degree-seeking. Please consult their webpage on three-year bachelor's degrees to learn more.
17. What should I say in my application Statement of Purpose?
The statement of purpose allows you to highlight areas of your background or interests that may not be clear in other areas of your application. Therefore, it is very important to write a clear and concise statement that expresses your interest in the program, and what you hope to gain from, or bring to, the program of study. You may address special features of the program that made it the right fit for you, or you may address specific topics that you are interested in studying. You may wish to address aspects of your personal, academic, and work-related experiences that would make effective contributions to the program or would showcase your knowledge and interest in your chosen area of study. This statement should be concise, outline a plan for graduate studies, and indicate why Georgia Tech is the right graduate program to meet this plan. It should include what you plan to accomplish with our MSCS degree, and what we should remember about you when considering your application.
18. Whom should I ask to write my recommendation letters?
Three letters of recommendation are required and it is recommended that at least one of your recommendations come from faculty (it is not required to provide computer science faculty recommender) who are familiar with your academic performance.
At least one of the letters must be from a professor.
The letters of recommendation are submitted online. Information regarding the submission of the letters is given in the directions for submitting your online application.

The College does not offer financial aid to students entering this program. If you need assistance, please contact the Georgia Tech Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. Master's students are not guaranteed funding but frequently receive compensation after establishing a good working relationship with a faculty member. You are welcome to visit faculty members in your area of interest to ascertain if GRA (Graduate Research Assistantship) support is available. GRA is not guaranteed, but if you have a particular skill that a faculty member needs on a project, it can happen. Start looking as soon as possible. Often students find a GRA position during or by the end of their first semester. A few meet faculty during the “Admitted Students Visit” in the spring or use email and have one when they arrive in August, but very few students are able to do this. When working as a GTA (Graduate Teaching Assistant), you are required to have completed the course or its equivalent and scored an “A” grade. You should be prepared to cover at least your first semester as an out of state student. GRA and GTA positions provide a 12-credit tuition waiver, along with a monthly stipend based on percentage time worked) and a waiver of all but $25 of the tuition. With a GRA, students can expect to work 15 to 20 hours per week in addition to school work. Students are responsible for the mandatory fees and tuition supplement.

35. I was admitted to MSCS. What are the next steps?
Congratulations! We hope you are doing well and excited about starting your MSCS degree program at Georgia Tech!
We will follow-up with an email to all accepted students. Both the College of Computing and the Georgia Tech Office of Graduate Studies will hold orientation events during the week before the semester starts. New graduate students always register during Phase II of the term that they are starting. We will cover all of a lot of valuable information and answer all of your questions at an orientation which you will be invited to later this summer. You will also have an opportunity to meet with a College of Computing faculty member during orientation. Please visit the New Student checklist for helpful information.
You may want to join a community on the web and communicate with current and former students. There are fantastic resources to answer your questions. You can do your research to find a resource.
36. I was admitted to a different degree program and would like to switch to MSCS. Do you allow students to change majors?
Unfortunately, you are admitted only to the program to which you applied. If you want to switch to MSCS, you will have to apply again to the next available admit term. We do not accept change of majors into the MSCS program.
37. I am currently pursuing an MS CS at a different institution and would like to transfer to your program. Do you allow students to transfer?
Students are not allowed to transfer to our program as they must apply with all other applicants. Learn more at our MS CS admissions requirements page.
Georgia Tech Master’s students are only allowed to transfer in a maximum of 6 credit hours.
38. I was denied admission. I am disappointed that I was not accepted into your program. I feel that my record is very good. Can I find out what was wrong with my application?
Admission decisions are final. Our degree program is extremely competitive and due to space and financial limitations we can only enroll a small number of students and must decline many qualified applicants. The decision to accept is based on many factors including the GPA, letters of recommendation, GRE, area of interest of the student, TOEFL, available funding for students who want to pursue a Ph.D., specific faculty interest in the student, and available space. Many of these factors are not visible to students. Unfortunately, due to the volume of applicants, we cannot give specific feedback for any one student.
