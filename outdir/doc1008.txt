Ph.D. CS Machine Learning Body of Knowledge
Prepared by: The Machine Learning Faculty, November, 2017
The exam will be divided to four areas: core, statistical methods and models, learning theory, and decision processes. There will be three questions in each area. Each student has to answer two out of the three questions in the core area. In addition, each student has to select two out of the remaining three areas where he or she will answer two out of the three questions.
