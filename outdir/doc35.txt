College of Computing Annual Awards and Honors
The College of Computing Office of the Dean has worked with Institute Leadership and the Office of Human Resources to submit our awards each year since FY2020 to USG for approval. All awards have been approved from last year and we have added a handful of new awards.
The College of Computing is pleased to celebrate the accomplishments of our faculty, staff, and students. Please help us honor our Community through recognition of our dedicated contributors. It is our hope that this site (and the College of Computing Awards Committee) encourages action, provides the information, and offers the guidance necessary to facilitate that recognition.
Sincerely,
