Information Internetworks
Represent, transform, transmit, and present information.
The Information Internetworks thread is where computing meets data enterprise. This thread deals with implications in the context of personal and organizational information management. Information Internetworks prepares students for all levels of information management by helping them to capture, represent, organize, transform, communicate, and present data so that it becomes information, using geographically distributed multi-national organizations and information needs as context.
The student who pursues Information Internetworks can combine it with Systems and Architecture to develop information rich distributed systems, with Devices to ensure data synchronization in ad-hoc networks of small devices, with Media to build multiplayer online games, with Modeling to study text retrieval and classification, or with People to pursue research in data visualization.
