Research Centers: Frames of Inquiry
Georgia Tech prides itself on a long history of interdisciplinary work, and GT Computing research centers continue this tradition of reaching across academic boundaries to tackle important problems. The College of Computing provides an intellectual home for centers devoted to both practical and theoretical application, in areas from hardware systems and information security to robotics and human-computer interaction. While based in computing, each center includes faculty from other Georgia Tech units who work collaboratively with the college in service of common goals.
