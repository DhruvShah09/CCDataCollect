Introduction
|
||
||
||
||

|
|We are in an era of measurement, where sensors of all forms continuously capture phenomena and store them in data. While one would hope that the wealth of data would be an asset, too often the reverse is true: the volume of data simply serves to confuse and paralyze a person in a decision-making process. How do we build technology to help people make sense of their data, empowering them with insights to make decisions, produce scientific discoveries, and increase their understanding of the data-rich world we live in?
|
|The field of Information visualization is the study of how people use symbols, images, graphics, and interfaces to help examine, analyze, and understand data and information. Here, the term "information" generally means abstract data that has no physical correspondence, such as baseball statistics, large text corpuses, customer purchase databases, telephone calling patterns, and so on. Understanding information visualization requires a person to learn about basic multivariate data characterizations, visual properties such as color and animation, general visualization techniques, and existing information visualization tools and systems.
|
|The literature in this area selects readings from topics including: understanding of how to bind data attributes and values to visual encodings and visual metaphors, evaluating the effectiveness of a visualization to generate insights for users, leveraging toolkits and frameworks to create visualizations, and understanding the value that visualizations have in helping humans think about (and analyze) their data.
|
|Most importantly, students seeking an in-depth understanding of the area should take the course, CS 7450 - Information Visualization.

Cognitive Foundations
|
||
||
||
||
|
|An important part of information visualization is understanding how the techniques we create interact with the cognitive and perceptual systems of people. The readings below discuss how some of these concepts have been explored.

Interaction
|
||
||
||
||
||
|
|User interaction in visualization lets people ask questions of their data, change representations to see alternative views, and perform other data-centric and visualization-centric operations to explore their data and gain insight. The papers below describe the different types of interactions that can be found in visualizations and the different ways that interaction and cognition go hand-in-hand. Finally, the third paper explores interaction beyond traditional desktop WIMP styles.

Presentation and Storytelling

|While many people think of the analytical purposes of visualization, its role in presentation and storytelling is just as important. The paper below explores the communication-driven application of visualization.
