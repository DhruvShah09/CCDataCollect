Computing Career Services
Today’s job market is highly competitive. Our students want to design mobile apps and video games; develop software for major corporations; create interactive designs and marketing campaigns; use machine learning and data analytics to address real-world challenges; start their own businesses; and much more.
These students work in healthcare, sports, finance, retail, entertainment and countless other industries. Each student’s career path looks different and Career Services is along for the journey. As we provide guidance and resources for early career seekers, these students continue to find opportunities to engage beyond the classroom to enhance their professional toolkits including internships, co-ops, and fellowship programs.
Our mission in Career Services at the College of Computing (CoC) is to open doors for student opportunities in diverse fields and industries. The possibilities are endless as we look at how research and technical knowledge weave into every fiber of the workforce.
With individualized guidance, employer connections, and resources that build your job search and personal development, the College of Computing Career Services Center will help you on the journey to success.
