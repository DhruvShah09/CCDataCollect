Klaus Startup Challenge
Named in honor of Christopher W. Klaus, the Klaus Startup Challenge is an entry-level pitch competition designed to prepare beginner entrepreneurs for future competitions and funding opportunities. Participants in the startup challenge have the opportunity to engage in a series of workshops and mock pitches, receive feedback from experienced entrepreneurs and mentors, and compete in a live pitch competition held annually in the spring semester.
In its inaugural year, 19 teams comprised of GT Computing students and alumni competed for a spot in the 2021 cohort of the CREATE-X Launch program. After pitching to a panel of judges from various organizations within the local Atlanta ecosystem, including VentureAtlanta, ATDC, CREATE-X, and TechOperators Venture Capital, Reflex was selected as the winning team of the inaugural Klaus Startup Challenge.
Applications for 2023 Klaus Challenge are due Feb. 28.
Live Competition will be held March 30.
