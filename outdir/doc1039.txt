Our Five Schools Define Computing Education and Research
Georgia Techâ€™s College of Computing has been a leader in defining modern computing as a paradigm that combines the foundations of theoretical mathematics and information science, the force of invention in computational systems and processes, and interdisciplinary practice that integrates innovation in computing with all facets of life.
Today, the college comprises five schools that offer unique academic programs and conduct research specifically related to their concentration areas: Computer Science, Cybersecurity and Privacy, Interactive Computing, Computing Instruction, and Computational Science and Engineering.
Computational Science and Engineering
CSE makes fundamental advances in the creation and application of new computational methods and techniques.
Cybersecurity and Privacy
CSP brings together researchers from across multiple colleges and the Georgia Tech Research Institute to create a new frontier in interdisciplinary research and education.
Interactive Computing
IC redefines the human experience of computing by examining the impact of computation and computing-mediated interactions on everyday life.
Computer Science
CS defines the foundations and advances the frontiers of computing by developing research and tools that power computers now and into the future.
Computing Instruction
The School of Computing Instruction teaches computer science to every undergraduate on campus, and investigates new techniques and technologies for scalable computing instruction.
