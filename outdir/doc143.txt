Impact Living Learning Community
The Impact Program is a relatively new aspect of the Community Services offered in the College of Computing. We’ve enhanced our services by creating cohorts for students that often find themselves without a network. Students often need someone to talk to. You need to know where to go in and outside of campus. They also need safe and convenient ways of getting there. They need a familiar face or faces that take the same classes and are experiencing the same issues. Sometimes there’s also a voice that they need to hear that connects them to teaching assistants, professors, or tutors. That voice also can also “suggest” calling home to mom or dad if there’s a need. I serve as that voice for many students in the College of Computing.
