Dean's Desk - July 20, 2021
Dear GT Computing community,
I’ve got some good news today. Georgia Tech has just been rated #5 globally for computer science research by Guide2Research.com.
Now, there are a lot of rankings out there, but this one is particularly interesting because it’s based on our collective h-index. For those who don’t know, the h-index is a measurement that tracks how much a researcher publishes and (importantly) how many other researchers are citing their work. It is a kind of shorthand for our intellectual influence.
As we all know, rankings are useless, except the ones I like, and I like this one because it shows that the research we do here is influential.
In other good news, the College of Computing has three alumni on this year's 40 under 40 list:
- Mahdi Al-Husseini (MS CS '20), an aeromedical evacuations officer for the U.S. Army who also develops technology and policy for aviation safety.
- Vanessa Larco (BS CS '08), venture capitalist and founding member of LatinXVC, a group to help Latinos enter venture capitalism.
- Dhawal Shah (MS CS '10), CEO of Class Central, a website that has matched more than 40 million users to online education programs.
Finally, I’m starting to hear from teams across the College who are formulating their work plans for fall. Please continue working with your supervisors as they fill out the details.
So there you go. Have a good week. Find some time to take it easy. Take a moment and go for a drive, spend time with your friends and your family. I’ll see you back here next week. I have to go catch a plane.
Peace.
