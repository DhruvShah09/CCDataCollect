Hiring Guidelines
The College of Computing recognizes that students need time to make informed decisions when evaluating and responding to offers. We also recognize that employers need to effectively manage their time-sensitive recruitment processes. The following guidelines are intended to help both students and employers manage the offer process in a fair and transparent framework. We have created these guidelines to help minimize reneges, reduce the pressure put on our students, and align with the GT campus.
"Experience shows the best employment decisions for both students and employers are those that are made without pressure and with the greatest amount of information and transparency. Students are given sufficient time to attend career fairs, participate in on-campus interviews, and/or complete the interviewing in which they are currently engaged are more likely to make good long-term employment decisions and may be less likely to renege on job acceptances."

Our guidelines are intended to help both students and employers manage the offer process in a fair and transparent framework. Our hope is to minimize reneges and reduce the pressure on students
Other Guidelines:
-
CoC Career Services expects all employers to refrain from exploding offers when recruiting our students. Students should not feel pressured to accept offers “on the spot” or within a quick turnaround time.
-
Employers are recommended to be flexible in granting offer extensions on a case-by-case basis if the circumstances warrant it.
-
Students will be encouraged to contact employers directly if they have any questions or concerns about their offers, including needing more time to make their decisions. At times, the Director of Career Services may reach out on a students’ behalf.
-
All offers should be made in writing, either electronic or hard-copy. The start of the timeline is defined by the date on the written offer letter.
-
Employers who post jobs, attend a career fair, or recruit on campus with the College of Computing Career Services must adhere to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) guidelines, the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Principles for Ethical Professional Practice, the Georgia Tech Campus-wide policies and the Policies & Guidelines laid out by the College of Computing Career Services listed on this page.
-
We strongly discourage any employer from withdrawing offers of internships or full-time employment. This action can tarnish the reputation of a company on campus.
