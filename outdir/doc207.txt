Biography
I am an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. My research is at the intersection of Internet measurement, data science and cybersecurity. I am interested in understanding when and how Internet infrastructure can fail and proposing remedies. To this end, I develop methods and build near-real-time streaming data analytics systems (IODA, BGPStream, GRIP) that combine diverse data to monitor and improve Internet infrastructure security and reliability. I am also interested in understanding political motivations and implications of Internet cybersecurity events and phenomena, which led me to start in 2014 a series of small workshops on Internet Measurement and Political Science. Before joining Georgia Tech I was an Associate Research Scientist and Principal Investigator at CAIDA, the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, University of California San Diego. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering and Systems at University of Napoli "Federico II", Italy, in 2008.
