Entrepreneurship
John P. Imlay Jr. Series
To highlight these entrepreneurs and inspire those that follow, GT Computing has established the John P. Imlay Jr. Series on Entrepreneurship. This series began in 2019 with profiles of GT Computing students, alumni, and faculty that are shaping the College's entrepreneurial culture. In fall 2020, we expanded the initiative to include a monthly speaker series.
Klaus Startup Challenge
Named in honor of Christopher W. Klaus, the Klaus Startup Challenge is an entry-level pitch competition designed to prepare beginner entrepreneurs for future competitions and funding opportunities. Participants will have the opportunity to participate in a series of workshops and mock pitches, receive feedback from experienced entrepreneurs and mentors, and compete in a live pitch competition held annually in the spring semester.
Entrepreneurship Resources
There are a wealth of resources, both on campus and within the greater Atlanta community, available to students, faculty, and alumni entrepreneurs regardless of experience.
