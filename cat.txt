Graduate-Level Courses
Undergraduate-Level Courses
Distance Learning and International Sites
Academic content delivered through distance learning is in accordance with the course descriptions as approved by the Institute Curriculum Committee. All courses require approval by the Institute Curriculum Committee and the Academic Senate. All offerings for academic credit delivered through the Division of Professional Education have been approved in this manner.
Academic content delivered at our international sites, such as GT-Lorraine and GT-Shenzhen, is in accordance with the course descriptions as approved by the Institute Curriculum Committee. All courses require approval by the Institute Curriculum Committee and the Academic Senate regardless of where they are delivered. All Study Abroad Programs are approved on a yearly basis by the Institute Undergraduate Curriculum Committee as recommended by the Study Abroad Subcommittee.
Graduate Academics
The faculty of Georgia Tech grants advanced degrees in engineering, science, business, computing, architecture, city and regional planning, public policy, and other technology-related areas. The goals for graduate studies and research are to establish an educational environment that will strengthen students’ personal and professional development, to encourage students and faculty to pursue the discovery and generation of new knowledge through research, to investigate ways of applying such knowledge for the benefit of society and humanity, and to foster the development of new tools, objects, and ideas.
Students whose interests and aptitudes lead them beyond the limits of the traditional undergraduate curriculum may broaden their knowledge of a given field and pursue independent inquiry through graduate study. A graduate education is of particular benefit to students interested in careers in research, management, development, design, or consulting; to those who aspire to formulate and administer policy; and to those who desire careers in higher education.

Other Requirements
Enrollment Requirements
Additional Graduation Requirements
Language Requirements
Responsible Conduct for Research (RCR)
The Doctoral Degree
The degree of Doctor of Philosophy recognizes demonstrated proficiency and high achievement in research. After adequate preparation, the candidate must successfully complete both comprehensive examinations in their academic field and a searching and authoritative investigation of a special area in the chosen field, culminating in a written dissertation. The program of study for each doctoral degree program must include, at a minimum, 30 approved credit hours.
Admission to Candidacy
Doctoral students customarily apply for degree candidacy after completing at least three semesters of coursework beyond the bachelor's degree.
To qualify for candidacy, students must do the following:
- Complete the requirements for training in Responsible Conduct for Research (RCR).
- Complete all course requirements (except the minor).
- Achieve a satisfactory scholastic record.
- Pass the comprehensive examination.
- Submit a formal statement naming the dissertation reading committee and delineating the research topic for approval to the school chair and Graduate Students (on behalf of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Faculty Affairs).
Upon satisfactory completion of these requirements, the Office of Graduate Studies will formally admit the applicant to candidacy for the degree on behalf of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Faculty Development.
Comprehensive Exams
The comprehensive examination assesses both general knowledge of the degree area and specialized knowledge of the student's chosen research field. Each program is responsible for scheduling comprehensive examinations at least once a year and for providing students information regarding exam formats, rules, and scope. Exam retakes are to occur no later than the end of the student’s second full term (Fall, Spring, or Summer) in residence following the failed attempt.
Thesis Topic
Before a student becomes a candidate, they should present a formal statement for the approval of the school chair or college dean and Graduate Studies that outlines the student's dissertation advisor, the topic selected for investigation, the objectives, and the steps by which the student proposes to achieve them. (Note that individual programs may have additional requirements for approving the dissertation prospectus or proposal before approval by the chair/dean and Graduate Studies.) The dissertation topic must give promise of being either a genuine addition to the fundamental knowledge of the field or a new and better interpretation of facts already known.
Time Limit for Degree Completion
Students must complete all degree requirements within seven years from the end of the term in which they pass the comprehensive examination.
Dissertation
The dissertation must demonstrate that the candidate possesses powers of original thought, talent for research, and ability to organize and present findings. Dissertations must be submitted electronically via the Electronic Thesis and Dissertation website.
The format of the dissertation (in general appearance) must meet the criteria published in the Manual for Graduate Theses. For other format or style questions, students should refer to style manuals appropriate to their disciplines.
Doctoral Examination
If the dissertation advisory committee finds the dissertation satisfactory, it schedules the candidate for an oral examination on the subject matter of the dissertation and the field in which it lies. An examining committee approved by Graduate Studies on behalf of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Faculty Development will conduct the examination. The candidate's academic unit should forward the announcement of the oral examination, including the names of the examining committee members, to Graduate Studies at least 10 working days prior to the exam.
If a candidate should fail to pass the final oral examination, the examining committee may recommend permission for one additional examination. In the case of failure, the Registrar does not receive a report of the examination results.
Minor Field of Study
In addition to an adequate knowledge of the major field of intended research, the student must demonstrate mastery of another smaller body of knowledge—the minor field—preferably outside the student's school. The purpose of the minor is to encourage a wider interest on the part of the student and can include topics that will help them in their research or those that will allow them to explore and prepare for their future careers.
The minor will normally consist of at least six semester hours of work in related courses, selected by the student in consultation with a guidance committee and approved by the Graduate Studies (on behalf of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Faculty Development). These courses should be at the 6000 level or above, but the use of certain 4000 level courses may also be approved. The student must receive a letter grade of C or higher for a course to count towards the doctoral minor. (Courses that are taken as pass/fail are not eligible to count toward the doctoral minor). Courses taken at other institutions may be included in the minor. Once the student has satisfactorily completed the minor, the school chair will send a confirmation, accompanied by course grades, to Graduate Studies for final approval and recording.
Although the student need not complete the minor as a prerequisite to become a candidate, the minor must be completed and approved in order to be cleared for graduation.
Other Requirements
Enrollment Requirements
The matriculation requirements for doctoral students are similar to those outlined for the master's degree with the addition of the residency requirement: doctoral students should spend at least one full-time semester in residence at Georgia Tech and should conduct research for their dissertation while in residence. Under special circumstances, candidates may receive permission to pursue their research in absentia, provided the chair of the appropriate school approves and a Georgia Tech faculty member directs the project. Although doctoral students working full-time on thesis research should normally be registered for a full course load of 9000-level dissertation hours each semester, this requirement is at the discretion of the advisor and the department. No minimum number of 9000-level dissertation hours is required for the doctoral degree. Doctoral students must be registered in the semester of graduation.
If a student has completed all degree requirements and will no longer require any of the Institute's facilities or faculty time, the student may request an enrollment waiver from the Office of Graduate Studies.
Additional Graduation Requirements
In addition to the requirements listed elsewhere, the candidate is required to complete the following:
- Complete an Online Application for Graduation to petition for the degree to the Registrar's Office during the term preceding the anticipated final term of work.
- Have an overall GPA of at least 3.0.
- Register for a minimum of one hour of dissertation in the term of graduation. This reduction from the normal minimum course load of three hours may be used only once. If all requirements for graduation, including submission of the final approved dissertation, have been completed prior to the last day of registration and the student was registered for the preceding term, the student may apply for a waiver of the enrollment requirement.
- Submit the dissertation to the Electronic Thesis and Dissertation website prior to the final submission of the completed dissertation to Graduate Studies.
If both the dissertation and the examination are satisfactory, and the candidate has completed the requirements of residence, minor field, and any additional school requirements, Graduate Studies will certify the candidate as qualified to receive the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.
Responsible Conduct for Research (RCR)
All Georgia Tech doctoral students are required to complete Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training, which includes an online training component and in-person training. All master’s thesis students are also required to complete RCR training. See www.rcr.gatech.edu for more information.
Expectations of Advisors and Advisees
The relationship between advisor and advisee is central to the experience of students in research-based graduate programs. Both partners in this relationship must contribute for it to succeed. Successful advisor-advisee relationships enhance the careers of both partners. The relationship can take on three forms: advisor-advisee; supervisor-employee; and mentor-mentee. In the best cases, the three forms work together. This document articulates key contributions from each partner to an advisor-advisee relationship that leads to mutual benefit.
The Advisor
Advising graduate students in research-based programs is part of the job expectation for almost all Georgia Tech faculty members. Graduate students build the faculty member’s research record and reputation by contributing to the advisor’s research program. This situation carries an inherent tension. Although the faculty member’s success depends at least in part on the student’s success, the faculty member may also be responsible to outside sponsors, whose goals may not directly match those of the student. As an educator, the advisor must always protect the student’s interests as well as the sponsor’s and his or her own in the research relationship.
The Advisee
The student’s motivation is to earn a degree, which requires the acquisition of scholarly knowledge and research competence. Participation in the research process is an essential requirement for all Georgia Tech doctoral students and many master’s degree students. In this part of their education, the student’s duty is to put a best faith effort into his or her assigned contribution to the research process. At the same time, Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs) are also employees who help the advisor and research group meet the requirements of a contract or grant; while, Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and Graders are also employees of the school or program who help the school or program meet their educational requirements. As such they are employees with a set of job responsibilities that may not align with their research objectives or those of their advisors. As with the faculty advisor, this situation sets up an inherent tension between the student’s educational goals and his or her employment responsibilities.
Mutual Expectations
Students Expect from their Advisor:
Respect
- Respect as a person, student, and professional employee
- Recognition and respect for differences in culture, ethnicity, gender, and other dimensionsof diversity

Requirements for the Master's Degree
Graduate Course Option
Enrollment Requirements
Program of Study
Master's Thesis
Requirements for the Award of the Master's Degree
Graduate Course Option
Students completing both a bachelor’s and master’s in the same discipline at Georgia Tech may use up to six credit hours of graduate-level coursework in the major discipline for both degrees. Recognizing that some master’s degree programs do not have a unique undergraduate counterpart program and that some master’s programs are offered by several schools, the term “discipline” in the prior sentence will be broadly interpreted in such cases. To qualify for this option, students must complete the undergraduate degree with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher and complete the master’s degree within a two-year period from the award date of the bachelor’s degree.
Enrollment Requirements
While students may enroll in a master's degree program upon admission with either full or conditional standing, all conditions must be met and the student's status changed to "full" in order to graduate with a master's degree. Students enrolled in a master's degree program must register for at least one semester per year in order for the original requirements for their degree to remain unchanged. In other cases, the school may reevaluate the student's credentials and impose additional degree requirements.
Students who have completed all coursework and are planning to submit a thesis in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a master's degree should register for research hours (MAJR 7000) consistent with a realistic appraisal of the amount of remaining thesis work and required faculty involvement. Students are not eligible to receive thesis guidance during any term for which they are not registered.
Students must normally enroll for a minimum of three hours each semester. Thesis students may enroll for one hour of thesis only in the semester of graduation; this option may be used only once. The Institute has no residency requirements for the master's degree.
If a student has completed all degree requirements and will no longer require any of the Institute's facilities or faculty time, the student may request an enrollment waiver.
Program of Study
The student, in consultation with the faculty advisor, should prepare a program of study for the master's degree as a guide for planning an academic schedule. In some cases, the student's school may require that the proposed program be submitted to the chair of that school for approval.
The program of study must be completed satisfactorily within six consecutive calendar years and must include, at a minimum, 30 approved credit hours distributed as follows:
With thesis:
- Minimum course credit hours in major field (a basic field of knowledge, not a department of specialization): 12
- Minimum course credit hours at 6000 to 9000 level: 12
- Minimum course credit hours for degree: 18
- Minimum Thesis hours (7000): 6
- Total credit hours: 30
Without thesis: (must have approval of school chair)
- Minimum course credit hours in major field (a basic field of knowledge, not a department of specialization): 18
- Minimum course credit hours at 6000 to 9000 level: 21
- Total credit hours: 30
Some schools require more than the minimum credit hours. Refer to specific academic program descriptions for more detailed information.
Other than thesis hours, the student may use only three hours under the pass/fail designation in the approved program of study.
Students who are pursuing two Master's degrees at Georgia Tech may double count a maximum of 6 hours of credit for both degrees. This ensures that each degree involves a minimum of 24 hours of coursework completed at Tech that is not double counted. Students should consult with their advisors on sharing coursework among Master's degrees.
Students may be eligible to utilize the Graduate Course Option or participate in an approved BS/MS program. Students should refer to the Catalog for requirements for the Graduate Course Option and for BS/MS program requirements.
Master's Thesis
To complete the requirements for the master's degree, the student must submit a master's thesis unless the school chair determines that additional coursework is of more importance in meeting approved objectives.
Students who meet the requirements for the master's degree by completing a combination of coursework and thesis must register for a minimum of six hours of thesis credit.
A candidate whose program includes a thesis must present a treatise in which the results of an investigation directed by a member of the faculty of the Institute are set forth in a clear, articulate form. The purpose of the thesis is to further educational development by requiring the student to plan, conduct, and report an organized and systematic study of importance.
The Manual for Graduate Theses specifies the formatting requirements for the thesis. Information regarding electronic thesis/dissertation submission can also be found on the Graduate Studies website.
Requirements for the Award of the Master's Degree
For a student to receive a master's degree from Georgia Tech, the following requirements should be met:
- During the semester prior to the anticipated final semester of work, students should petition to graduate. This can be done by completing the Online Application for Graduation.
- The Approved Program of Study (which is listed on the petition for degree application) should show that course requirements for the master's degree will be satisfied before or during the final semester. The Approved Program of Study should be completed within a period of no more than six consecutive calendar years.
- Students should have an overall GPA of at least 2.70 and satisfy all school academic requirements. (Some schools may require a higher overall GPA, and some programs may have different GPA requirements for certain segments of the program requirements, such as for core classes. If so, this must be reported to the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee through the initial proposal or as a curriculum change and will be considered an informational item on the agenda. These requirements will be enforced at graduation.)
- Students should earn a grade of at least D on coursework for it to be considered completed. (Some individual programs may require a grade of C or higher. These requirements must be reported to the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee either as part of the initial proposal or as part of a curriculum change and will be considered an informational item on the agenda. These requirements will be enforced at graduation.)
- Students may take three hours on a pass/fail basis, per Institute policy. (However, individual programs may not allow pass/fail grades at all or may restrict them to only specific portions of the degree such as electives. These restrictions must be reported to the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee as part of the initial proposal or as part of a curriculum change and will be enforced at graduation.)
- Students should be registered for a minimum of three credit hours at all times. However, thesis students are permitted to enroll for one hour of MAJR 7000 in the semester of graduation. This reduction may be used only once. Students who have met all requirements for graduation before the last day of registration for the graduation term and who were registered the preceding semester may be eligible for a waiver of enrollment.
- Coursework at the 1000 or 2000 level may not be used for a master's degree. In most cases, coursework at the 3000 level may not be used for a master's degree. But individual programs may allow a reasonable number of 3000-level courses in special circumstances, such as in a program that requires language proficiency. Individual programs may include 4000-level coursework, but this must be reported to the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee as either part of the initial proposal or clearly stated when revising a program. These rules will be enforced at graduation.
- Students should have completed satisfactorily any language requirement imposed by the major school.
- Thesis students must complete the requirements for training in Responsible Conduct for Research (RCR).
- Students should have passed any qualifying or comprehensive examinations required by their school.
- Students should have completed any required coursework outlined at the time of matriculation.
- Students should ensure that all requirements for the degree are completed and certified by the Office of the Registrar no later than 48 hours after final grades for the term are due. If a candidate for a degree is not certified by the appropriate deadline, the degree will not be awarded. It is the responsibility of the student to reactivate the degree petition for the following semester.
- The diploma of a candidate for a degree shall bear the date of the latest commencement ceremony for the term in which the degree is awarded with the exception of summer graduation diplomas, which will bear the date of the official end of term.
Additional Requirements for Master's Thesis Students
- Students should submit the thesis topic and committee form to Graduate Studies for approval and make satisfactory progress on the thesis.
- Students should complete the requirements for training in Responsible Conduct for Research (RCR).
- Students should submit the thesis electronically to the Electronic Thesis and Dissertation website and receive final acceptance from Graduate Studies.
Language Requirement
The student's school may require a reading knowledge of one appropriate language other than English.
Graduate Policies and Regulations
The Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee, with the approval of the Academic Faculty Senate, is responsible for establishing academic policy for the graduate programs; however, final authority rests with the Senate. This committee reserves the right to change requirements for degrees as may be appropriate. Students enrolled at the time such changes appear in the Catalog have the privilege of following either the requirements stated in the Catalog effective the semester in which they enrolled or the requirements in the Catalog that records the change.
This catalog records the institute-wide policies and regulations that govern the graduate programs. Schools may make additional rules concerning their programs and the pursuit of their degrees, but such rules may not contradict Institute policies and regulations.
Transfer Credit
A student may not apply for transfer credit until after matriculation at Georgia Tech. The courses to be transferred would typically be those appearing on the approved program of study form for the masters degree. A doctoral student normally does not request transfer credit. The rules relative to and the process for obtaining transfer of credit for graduate-level courses are as follows:
- Student's in a master's degree program requiring fewer than 33 semester credit hours may receive up to six hours of transfer credit for graduate-level courses taken at an institution accredited by a Canadian or U.S. regional accrediting board, or at a foreign school or university that has a signed partner agreement with Georgia Tech, and not used for credit toward another degree. This ensures completion of at least one-third of the courses for a degree in residence at Georgia Tech (applies to programs that are face-to-face and online format). A student in a master's degree program requiring 33 semester credit hours or more may receive up to nine hours of transfer credit for graduate-level courses taken at an institution accredited by a Canadian or U.S. regional accrediting board, or at a foreign school or university that has a signed partner agreement with Georgia Tech, and not used for credit toward another degree. This ensures completion of at least one-third of the courses for a degree in residence at Georgia Tech (applies to programs that are face-to-face and online format).The student must supply a current transcript for this evaluation.
- To obtain transfer of credit, the student must complete the following procedure:
- The student will confer with the graduate advisor to ascertain whether the courses to be transferred are a logical part of the student's graduate program;
- If the courses are appropriate, the student will deliver to the school that teaches such courses a copy of the current transcript, necessary descriptive materials including catalog descriptions, and textbooks used for evaluation. The faculty of the appropriate school will determine the equivalent Georgia Tech course and the number of credit hours accepted. The faculty member who prepares the transfer credit form (i.e., the Non-Resident Credit Report) should have the school chair cosign it. The school should then send the form directly to the registrar with a copy of the student's Approved Program of Study attached;
- If the student wishes to transfer more than the number of hours permitted in item one listed above, a petition must be submitted to the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee that includes statements of possible justification for the granting of such a petition, transfer credit forms, and the recommendation of the student's school chair.
- A joint enrollment student may receive graduate credit for up to one-third of the hours required for the degree for graduate courses taken at Emory University or Georgia State University provided that the following is true:
- Georgia Tech does not offer such courses;
- The student's advisor and school chair approve the courses in advance and in writing;
- The student passes the courses with a C or better. Advance approval is satisfied when the courses appear on the student's proposed Program of Study.
- A student may not receive transfer credit from universities outside the United States and Canada unless the courses were taken at a foreign institution or university that is accredited by a Canadian or U.S. regional accrediting board or has a signed partner agreement with Georgia Tech. In any other case, an international student can obtain credit for courses previously taken but not applied toward another degree by filling out an Examination for Advanced Standing Authorization Request Form, paying the appropriate fee at the Bursar's Office, and passing the examination for advanced standing. The school or college that normally teaches the equivalent course will administer any necessary examinations.
Double Counting Credit between Master’s Degrees
Students who are pursuing two Master’s degrees at Georgia Tech may double count a maximum of 6 hours of credit for both degrees. This ensures that each degree involves a minimum of 24 hours of coursework completed at Tech that is not double counted.
The six-hour limit may be exceeded when specifically allowed as a component of an approved degree program.

No staff member beyond the rank of instructor in a school may work for a master's degree in that school. No new staff member with the rank of assistant professor in a school may work for a doctoral degree in that school.
General
A student who wishes to withdraw their name from the rolls of degree candidates must formally withdraw the Online Application for Graduation before the end of the seventh week of the semester (or fourth week of the summer term). This privilege will be extended to a degree candidate only once.
Graduate Student Work Loads
Full-time students must be enrolled for at least 12 credit hours on a letter grade or pass/fail basis. As an exception, the advisor and school chair may allow up to three hours out of the minimum 12 to be taken on an audit basis in fall and spring semesters; in summer semesters, the advisor and school chair may allow up to six hours out of the 12 minimum to be taken on an audit basis. (This exception is not applicable for students on immigrant visas or certain fellowships requiring them to enroll in at least 12 credit hours on a letter grade or Pass/Fail basis each academic term.) Hours in excess of the required 12 may be taken on any basis. Full-time students working exclusively on thesis research should be registered for 18 or more hours of 7000 or 9000 level courses (master's or doctoral thesis courses) in fall and spring semesters, and for up to 16 hours during summer semesters.
The maximum load for graduate students in good standing is 21 hours in fall/spring and 16 hours in summer. The minimum load is three hours, except for the semester of graduation. During the semester of graduation, a student is permitted to register for only one hour of master’s or doctoral thesis courses (7000 or 9000). This exception may be used only once for each degree.
Students with fellowships, graduate research or teaching assistantships, traineeships, tuition waivers, or student visas, and those assigned to the Institute by the armed forces for the purpose of pursuing a degree are required to enroll full time. Part-time doctoral students engaged in research for their Ph.D.s should meet the minimum enrollment requirement and register for the number of 9000 level hours consistent with the time they and their faculty advisors spend on the dissertation research.
Undergraduate Minors
Undergraduate Minor Guidelines
An undergraduate minor is a defined program of study outside the student's major field. Minors are intended to broaden the student's education by encouraging and officially recognizing knowledge obtained by the student in fields other than their major.
Minors are typically offered by Schools which also offer a major. A program of study for the minor is outlined and it may include more than one option or "track". Tracks allow students to focus on an aspect of the academic field that is of particular interest to them. It is expected that there will be depth of the program of study and that specific educational objectives will be met upon completion of the minor.
Other minors are offered where there is no undergraduate degree granting program at Georgia Tech. These minors cover fields which are inherently multidisciplinary; i.e., ones that are covered in part by multiple degree granting academic programs. Multidisciplinary minors require particularly broad Programs of Study which include courses from multiple Schools and/or Colleges.
Undergraduate Minors Offered
Click here for a list of minors offered at Georgia Tech. All undergraduate minor requirements are also available in DegreeWorks.
Program of Study
The program of study for each minor must satisfy the curricular requirements listed below. However, some minors, at the discretion of the offering academic unit(s) and approval from the Institute Curriculum Committee, may be exempt from some of these requirements, may exceed some requirements, and/or add additional requirements. Consult the advisor for the minor program for the specific requirements of that minor.
Requirements for the Program of Study
- A minor program of study must have at least 15 credit hours of coursework.
- A minor program of study must include at least 9 credit hours of courses numbered 3000 or above.
- Courses used to satisfy Core Areas A through E in a student's major degree program cannot also be used to satisfy the course requirements for a minor.
- Any free elective course used to satisfy the course requirements of the student's major degree program may also be used to satisfy the course requirements for a minor.
- All academic units may designate a block/blocks of courses outside of the student's major field of study in which the same course can be used to satisfy the course requirements in the student's major degree program and also be used to satisfy the course requirements for a minor.
- A multidisciplinary or other minor may contain courses in a student's major field of study. A maximum of 6 credit hours of such courses may be used to satisfy the course requirements for the minor, provided these courses are not also used to satisfy any course requirement in the student's major degree program.
- A maximum of 6 credit hours of Special Topics courses may be included in a minor program or the student may complete 3 credit hours of Special Topics and 3 credit hours of either Special Problems or Undergraduate Research. Students may not use 6 credit hours of either Special Problems or Undergraduate Research for a minor.
- A maximum of 3 credit hours of transfer credit may be used to satisfy the course requirements for a minor. This includes courses taken at another institution or credit earned through the AP or IB program, assuming the scores meet Georgia Tech minimum standards.
- A course may not be used to satisfy the requirements of more than one minor or certificate.
- All courses counting toward the minor must be taken on a letter-grade basis.
- All courses used to satisfy the course requirements for a minor must be completed with a grade of C (2.00) or better.
Other Guidelines
- A student should select a minor in consultation with an advisor in their major field of study. The minor selected must be:
- outside of the student's major, or
- a multidisciplinary minor that may include some courses in the student's major field of study. (See requirement #6 above.)
- The student should also consult with an advisor in the minor field of study who can inform and advise the student about the specific requirements of the minor. Some of these may be different than the requirements listed above.
- Students can declare a minor at any time. However, it is recommended that students declare the minor as soon as they have made the decision so that they can monitor their progress using the online degree audit and with their advisor. Declaration of the minor also provides information to the relevant academic units that is helpful in planning courses. The minor declaration form is on the Registrar's Office website at: http://www.registrar.gatech.edu/students/formlanding/changeminor.php.
- The student must complete a minor program of study form at the same time the online application for graduation is completed, generally during the semester before the terminal one. Program of study forms for all minors can be found here.
- The minor is conferred at the same time the major degree is conferred. The major degree and minor will be recorded on the student's transcript. The minor will not appear on the student's diploma.
- Minors will not be conferred retroactively upon students who have graduated.
Administrative Guidelines
- All proposals for a minor must originate from the faculty of the academic unit(s) offering the minor. Minors may originate in several ways, such as:
- a minor in a field in which Georgia Tech offers a degree program through a single academic unit (College/School),
- a multidisciplinary minor, in which the subject matter is covered by multiple degree granting academic programs in multiple academic units (Colleges/Schools),
- a minor in a field in which there is no undergraduate degree-granting program at Georgia Tech. In this case, the proposed minor must be in a recognized academic field or discipline and the offering academic unit(s) must have in place sufficient courses, faculty, and facilities.
- All proposals for a minor must include a statement of the educational objectives of the minor and how the program of study is used to satisfy these objectives.
- The academic unit(s) offering the minor may choose to require an admission process, set admission standards, and/or set enrollment limits.
- The academic units(s) offering the minor may request to be exempted from some of the curricular requirements applied to the program of study or add additional requirements if this is justified as essential to meeting the stated educational objectives of the minor.
- For a multidisciplinary or other minor, a maximum of 6 semester hours of courses in the student's major field of study may be used to satisfy the course requirements for a minor when their inclusion is justified as essential to meeting the stated educational objectives of the minor. However, these courses cannot also be used to satisfy any course requirement in the student's major degree program unless they belong to the special block of courses described in requirement #5 of the Requirements for the Program of Study of the minor.
- All proposals for a minor must include a plan for advising students pursuing the minor and for approving a student's completion of the required program of study.
- All proposals for a minor must be endorsed by the appropriate College Dean(s) and by the Provost.
- All undergraduate minors must be approved by the Institute Undergraduate Curriculum Committee and by the Academic Senate.
- Information and relevant documents for proposing a new minor can be found at http://www.icc.gatech.edu/submit/requirements.php?type=101

Undergraduate Programs
At the undergraduate level, Georgia Tech has withdrawn its programs from the Academic Common Market (ACM). This policy went into effect in the Summer 2011 semester.
Graduate Programs
At the graduate level only, Georgia Tech participates in the Academic Common Market (ACM), which is a program managed by the Southern Regional Education Board. ACM is an interstate agreement for sharing educational programs and facilities. It allows students to participate in selected programs not offered in their home states without having to pay out-of-state tuition charges..
The main purpose of the Academic Common Market is to assist states in offering together what they cannot offer alone. Residents of the participating states who qualify for admission and gain the approval of their state coordinators may enroll on an in-state tuition basis. Programs are added to and removed from the Market on an annual basis in order to reflect the changing needs of participating states. The State of Georgia currently makes program changes once annually during the spring.
These states currently participate: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virgina.
Bachelor of Science and Master of Science Degree Options (BS/MS Option)
Many schools at Georgia Tech offer BS/MS degree options that, like the Graduate Course Option, allow eligible students to use up to 6 credit hours of graduate-level coursework in the major discipline for both degrees.

Experiential Education
Georgia Tech Career Center
Graduate Cooperative Plan
Paid and Unpaid Internships
Georgia Tech Career Center
Georgia Tech believes that obtaining relevant, academically related experience outside of the classroom is an integral part of the educational process. The Career Center offers opportunities to obtain such experience through cooperative education and internships.
The Undergraduate Cooperative Plan (Co-op) has been offered at Georgia Tech since 1912. It offers students the opportunity to integrate practical experience with theory learned in the classroom. Many students participate each semester, working full time during alternating semesters, for a total of three semesters, for employers throughout the United States and the world. Accredited by the Accreditation Council for Cooperative Education, it is the largest optional co-op program in the country and one of the highest-ranked programs among public universities.
The Undergraduate Co-op Plan is available for students in all majors. Co-op students remain enrolled in school while on work terms by registering for the appropriate co-op courses.
The work experience received is a valuable asset to graduates starting out in their chosen professions. Neither college laboratory experience nor employment during vacations can take the place of organized co-op experience. The plan provides, to a substantial degree, the experience most companies require of their employees before promoting them to positions of higher responsibility. Work experience may also assist students who are undecided about their future career goals by determining early in their college careers whether they wish to continue in a particular field.
The daily contact with diverse groups among their fellow employees offers students practical insight into sociology, psychology, economics, and ethics that no textbook can supply. Finally, students receive compensation for their services from the employer. Typically, co-op students can save enough from their earnings to pay for a substantial part of their school expenses.
Internships provide practical experience for students who choose not to follow the Undergraduate Co-op Plan. Internships, the majority of which are paid positions, are an extremely viable way to obtain out-of-classroom experience. Similar to cooperative education, the jobs and the students' performance are monitored by the Career Center to ensure maximum benefit by all parties.
Students in all majors may participate in the internship program and may work any term during the academic year. There are also part-time internships available for those who wish to work while attending classes.
Program Eligibility for Co-ops and Internships:
• GPA of 2.0 or above
• Good academic standing
• Co-op students must have three or more academic semesters remaining at the start of the first work term
• Experiential Learning Application must be completed in CareerBuzz
Students are required to register their co-op terms with the Career Center and are enrolled in the CO-OP (tuition-free) 12 audit hour course. Students securing internships are also strongly encouraged to register these opportunities with the Career Center. Students will be registered in the INTN audit hours course based on the number of total work hours per week, as follows:
10-19 hours per week = 3-hour audit course
20-29 hours per week = 6-hour audit course
30-35 hours per week = 9-hour audit course
36+ hours per week = 12-hour audit course
Benefits of CO-OP and INTN Course Enrollment:
- Audit hours are recorded on the official transcript
- Earnings do not affect FAFSA status
- Maintain active student status during work terms
- Cancelation of housing without penalty if working 25 miles or more from campus
- Support from the Career Center during your work terms
- Eligibility for co-op scholarships
- Eligibility for membership in the Briaerean Honors Society
- Co-op designation on the graduation diploma at the completion of the 3 work terms with the same employer
For more information on co-ops and internships, visit our website, email us at careercenter@gatech.edu or call the Career Center at 404-894-3320.
Graduate Cooperative Plan
The Graduate Cooperative Education Program provides master’s and doctoral degree students majoring in any discipline at Georgia Tech the opportunity to supplement their graduate studies with specialized work experience. Graduate co-op students gain experience with top employers, earn competitive salaries to help defray educational expenses, and expand post-graduation career options while on semester-long work assignments.
The Graduate Co-op Program is available to enrolled Georgia Tech students and is based upon academic achievement. Internships related to a student’s field of study can receive academic approval as a graduate cooperative work assignment allowing students to work summer, fall, or spring semesters, full-time or part-time.
There are no fees associated with the Graduate Co-op Program and students are provided full-time enrollment status through their registration in a Graduate Co-op course. This permits students to retain all privileges of full-time enrolled students while on work assignments.
To participate in the Graduate Co-op Program, a student must
- have a 3.0 or better GPA,
- complete an online orientation session, and
- obtain a program participation letter from their major school.
Students normally identify their own job opportunities, but the Graduate Co-op Office provides access to a job posting database and can assist with career guidance, job searches, resumes, and cover letters. Graduate students accepting a graduate co-op/internship opportunity should see a Graduate Co-op Program advisor regarding offer letters, required academic approvals, registration permits, and any necessary work authorizations. Enrollment in a 6000-level co-op course, a noncredit/no-cost audit course with no student or Institute fees attached, is also required.
International students are eligible to participate, but F-1 visa holders must be enrolled for a minimum of two full-time semesters, excluding Summer sessions, before being able to work off campus. All international students on F-1, J-1, and other appropriate visas must work with the Office of International Education to secure work authorization documentation.

In addition to the internship and cooperative programs administered through the Career Center, students may participate in internships through the academic units. These internships are either paid or unpaid.
Students who receive pay for the internship may not also receive academic credit for it. Students who receive academic credit for an internship may not also receive pay for it. There may be rare exceptions to this policy, such as the legislative internship that is part of the program in Public Policy. Exceptions have to be approved by the curriculum committee.
When students request enrollment in a departmental internship, they must (for credit or pay) complete a departmental approval form. Departmental internship sections are set up by permit only, and the student is permitted for the appropriate section to register for it.
Academic units are strongly encouraged to use the following standard numbering system for internships that they offer for pay or credit. Schools that wish to add an internship course will need to submit a new course proposal form to the curriculum committee and request course numbers under their subject codes.

Global Research and Internship Program
The Global Research and Internship Program (GRIP) facilitates overseas work and research internship experiences for Georgia Tech students. Global Internships are related to a student’s major/career interests and allow them to develop professional skills in a cross-cultural setting. The research, corporate, and non-profit work experiences that students take part in range from 6 weeks to a full year. The Office of International Education’s GRIP staff advise students on resume writing, networking, and finding internships and also facilitate pre-departure preparation and support for students while abroad. For more information, visit oie.gatech.edu.
Georgia Tech-Lorraine
Georgia Tech-Lorraine (GTL) was established as the Institute's first international campus in 1990 in Metz, France, a city recently named by the New York Times as one of the top 44 places to see in the world. Centrally located in eastern France along the Luxembourg and German borders, GTL is less than 90 minutes by train from Paris. A highly innovative institution offering year-round undergraduate, Masters and PhD programs, GTL is also home to a strong sponsored research program that fosters the flow of new ideas, creates new opportunities, and develops highly valuable qualities in our students, such as global leadership and innovative thinking.
GTL affords students the opportunity to pursue their Georgia Tech degree while being immersed in the rich culture of Europe. At GTL, students from around the world get the opportunity to study in the heart of Europe and take courses taught in English by Georgia Tech faculty. As a faculty-led program, Georgia Tech-Lorraine offers a balance of engineering, computer science, humanities, French language, management, and social science courses from the Georgia Tech course catalog. Courses are specifically designed to fulfill the student's major and International Plan requirements and students may also take advantage of undergraduate research and international internship opportunities. GTL also provides tremendous value. Out-of-state students save, on average, several thousand dollars in tuition when studying at GTL versus studying on the Atlanta campus and in-state students may take advantage of the HOPE scholarship to study at GTL.
Georgia Tech-Lorraine offers an extensive graduate program encompassing a broad range of study in the areas of mechanical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, as well as computer science. Programs leading to the Master's or PhD degree from the Georgia Tech are available. GTL is home to the Unité Mixte Internationale GT-CNRS UMI 2958, a joint research laboratory with the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the largest scientifique research organization in Europe. The UMI has state-of-the-art research facilities and a well-funded research program. Cooperative agreements with local partner institutions enable GTL graduate students to pursue double degrees in engineering and sciences in addition to degrees from Georgia Tech. Upon successful completion of these highly innovative and integrated programs, students are awarded a Master's degree from the Georgia Tech and a Master's degree from a partner institution.

The International Plan
In today’s economy, employers are expecting to hire college graduates with international experience, global perspectives, intercultural communication skills, and the ability to work in diverse teams. In response to this need, Georgia Tech developed the International Plan, a globally-focused degree designation.
The International Plan is a challenging undergraduate academic program aimed at developing a student's global competence within the context of their major. It is an optional degree-long program that integrates overseas experiences, language proficiency, and globally-focused coursework into any participating major. It builds on existing undergraduate degree requirements and international opportunities, and it is intended to be completed within the normal time frame of a four-year undergraduate degree. Completion of the International Plan is recognized by a designation on the student's diploma, e.g., "B.S. in Electrical Engineering: International Plan."
A defining feature of the International Plan is coherence. Coherence refers to the connection between the destination(s) chosen to complete the international experiences, the language chosen to satisfy the language requirement, and the appropriateness to the student’s discipline. While some students’ Plans are inherently coherent through language, other students may link the elements of their Plan through academic and/or professional topics, creating “intellectual” coherence. The program is designed to give students a deep understanding of another culture so that they develop strong intercultural skills that will help them function effectively in a global environment. Students are encouraged to think strategically about their academic and international experience choices and seek guidance from their advisors.
In order to earn the International Plan designation in a participating major, students will complete the following components:
- Globally-Focused Coursework: Complete three courses, one from each of the following categories. Only one 1000-level course may be used to satisfy globally-focused coursework requirements.
- International relations
- A course about the country or region of the overseas experience
- Global economics
- International Experience: Complete two terms abroad (at least 26 weeks) engaged in any combination of study, research, and/or internship. International experiences for the International Plan must be approved by the International Plan staff and the major IP faculty representative.
- Second Language Proficiency: Demonstrate proficiency equivalent to four semesters of college-level language study. An optional Language Proficiency Distinction is available to students who demonstrate more advanced oral proficiency skills.
- Culminating Course: Complete a major-specific capstone course designed to tie the international studies and experiences together with the student's discipline.
- Have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.7 upon entrance to and graduation from the International Plan

Dual Enrollment Program for High School Students
Georgia Tech partners with high school and home study programs to enroll students in advanced courses. Our program intends to enrich the high school experience, not replace it. Students who take classes at Georgia Tech usually continue taking classes and participating in activities and organizations in their high school communities.
Admission for Dual Enrollment is available for fall semester for all programs (Distance Computer Science, Distance Math and On-campus Dual Enrollment.) Admission is available for spring for Distance Computer Science only. Summer courses are not available.
The admission process is selective. Most admitted applicants have completed the highest level math and science courses available in their high school curriculum. Visit the Office of Undergraduate Admission website for more details.
Learning Communities
Learning Communities are an academic strategy that link academics to on-campus living. Each Georgia Tech community is an integrated experience that promotes interactions between faculty and students, fosters collaboration among students, enhances campus and civic engagement, and eases both the academic and social transition to college.
Admitted first year students are invited to apply to:
- First-Year Semester Abroad
- Explore Living Learning Community
- Global Leadership Living Learning Community
- Grand Challenges Living Learning Community
- Honors Program Living Learning Community
- Impact Living Learning Community
- iGniTe Summer Programs
While each of these communities offers a different focus, they all have required academic coursework, an opportunity to reside with the community, and the option to continue living with members of the community in nearby apartments as upper-level students.
Rising second year students are invited to apply to:
- Women, Science, and Technology (WST) Living Learning Community
- International House (I-House) Living Learning Community
WST and I-House require students to participate in community activities and events and offer optional coursework.
Learning Support Policies
The Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education (OUE) administers the Learning Support Program. Co-requisite support courses (for non-academic credit) are offered for College Algebra, MATH 1111, and English Composition I, ENGL 1101, for students who need additional preparation to be successful in these and related courses.
Georgia Tech uses benchmark scores earned via the SAT (Evidenced-Based Reading and Writing and Math) or ACT (English and Math) to determine placement in Learning Support. Students who score below 480 on the SAT Evidence-Based Reading and Writing Section (or 17 on the ACT English) will be required to complete the learning support program for English. Students who score below 530 on the SAT Math Section (or 21 on the ACT Math) will be required to complete the learning support program for math. Students may be required to complete the learning support program for both English and math. Georgia Tech will consider the higher of the SAT and ACT scores when determining learning support placement.
Students who are required by the Institute to take courses in the Learning Support Program will be notified in writing.
Students placing into learning support for English will be required to take ENGL 0999, a three-hour (non-academic credit) course designed to reinforce critical reading and communications concepts, concurrently with ENGL 1101, a three-hour course.
Students placing into learning support for math will be required to take MATH 0999, a two-hour (non-academic credit) course designed to reinforce basic mathematical concepts, concurrently with MATH 1111, College Algebra, a four-hour course.
MATH 0999 and ENGL 0999 are not college level classes and cannot be applied to degree requirements, including free electives.
Students complete their learning support requirements when they pass the required college level course, ENGL 1101 or MATH 1111, with a grade of D or better.
Students who do not pass ENGL 1101 or MATH 1111 with a grade of D or better will be required to take both the co-requisite course and the college level course (ENGL 0999 and ENGL 1101 or MATH 0999 and MATH 1111) regardless of the grade they received in co-requisite course. Students will continue to take the combination of courses until they have passed the college level course, ENGL 1101 or MATH 1111, with grade of D or better. There is no limit to the number of times these classes and their corresponding co-requisites may be attempted.
The Learning Support Program requirements should be completed as soon as possible after matriculation to Georgia Tech. Students should work with advisors to determine the best timing for these requirements.
Contact your advisor for further information and assistance.
Preprofessional Programs
Georgia Tech offers Pre-professional programs and advising in the following areas:
- Pre-Health (includes all health professions, including pre-med, pre-dentistry, pre-pharmacy, and more)
- Pre-law
- Pre-teaching (K-12)
Students can look these advisors up on the Advising Web page.
Professional schools typically admit students with strong academic credentials, a well-balanced education, good communication skills, and a broad range of experiences. With the appropriate selection of elective courses, most majors at Georgia Tech provide suitable preparation for professional schools in any area.
The best choice of a major is usually the one in which the student has the greatest inherent interest. No specific major offers an obvious competitive advantage in assuring admission to professional schools.
Georgia Tech has elected not to have majors designated as pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, or pre-law. This approach to pre-professional education has two major advantages. First, students who elect not to enter professional school upon graduation are prepared for alternative careers immediately. Second, students who do continue on to professional school have backgrounds that often provide them with unique opportunities within their selected professions. Examples include medical research, development of medical devices and apparatus, patent law, or the legal aspects of design and construction.
President's Scholarship Program
The Stamps President's Scholars Program is Georgia Tech's premier and most prestigious merit-based scholarship. Recipients are selected from the top applicants for admission to Georgia Tech based on demonstrated excellence in scholarship, leadership, progress, and service as described on the Stamps President's Scholars Program web page. From the applicant pool, students selected as semifinalists submit a one-page resume before being interviewed. The top semifinalists are named finalists and invited, with their parents, to campus for additional interviews and an information weekend in March or April.
Transfer students are not eligible for the four-year award. Recipients must be US or UK Citizens or Permanent Residents.
Each year, 40 incoming first-year students receive the Stamps President's Scholarship, which is renewable for up to four academic years or eight semesters, contingent upon honors-level performance and continued leadership development as evidenced by involvement in program, campus, and community activities. Scholarships are "full ride," including tuition and mandatory fees, room and board, books, and personal expenses. See the website below for more information on stipends.
To ensure consideration, a student must apply as an incoming first-year student, and submit the Georgia Tech Application for First-Year Admission, along with the application fee by the relevant early action deadline.

Research and Innovation
Undergraduate Research
Undergraduate research offers students a unique opportunity to apply knowledge in a meaningful, real-world context to solve problems and explore issues no one has ever addressed. Students doing undergraduate research have the chance to develop deeper relationships with faculty and graduate students and to expand their résumé that will allow them to stand out to graduate schools and potential employers.
The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) facilitates research experiences for undergraduates across all disciplines. UROP creates initiatives to encourage students to participate in knowledge creation and research enterprise with Georgia Tech's world-class faculty. Students may participate in laboratory, scientific, or computing research, or they may be involved in new discoveries in literature, social sciences, architecture, or business. Undergraduate students can participate in part-time or full-time research for course credit or pay. Opportunities are available Institute-wide, within specific colleges and schools, and in interdisciplinary settings.
Additional opportunities include the President's Undergraduate Research Awards (PURA), the Research Option, spring symposia, workshops, and training sessions. Students may also reach out to their peers, in the Undergraduate Research Ambassadors mentoring program, regarding any of the UROP programs or for assistance in finding research opportunities at Georgia Tech. More information is available on the Undergraduate Research web page.
The Research Option
The Research Option offers students the opportunity for an in-depth, long-term research experience that culminates in a final paper or thesis. While the exact requirements for a research option vary by the academic unit, students typically take the following steps:
- Complete at least nine units of undergraduate research. At least six of the nine required hours should be on the same project. This research must be done with an approved Georgia Tech faculty member.
- Over at least two, preferably three, terms
- Research may be for either pay or credit (specific option plans differ by department).
- For research for-pay to count towards the Research Option, you must register for an audit-only class (2698 or 4698 in most but not all academic units).
- Take the sequence of two one-hour courses:
- Write a research proposal and submit a signed copy by two faculty readers (one being the primary faculty mentor) to the UROP office. All proposals must be approved and submitted, at the latest, before the student takes LMC 4702 and their final term of research. We would prefer that you complete and submit the signed and approved proposal upon completion of LMC 4701.
- Write an undergraduate thesis/report of research on their findings prior to graduation or upon completion of LMC 4702. This must be uploaded to the Georgia Tech online thesis database by the last day of finals of the students graduating semester.
- Submit the Certification Form for their participating school into the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program office prior to graduation. The forms may be found here. This form must be signed by two faculty readers (one being the primary faculty mentor), the undergraduate coordinator for the participating school, and the student.
For more information on specific plans and a list of participating schools, visit the Research Option web page.
Innovation and Entrepreneurship
Georgia Tech strongly encourages students to explore research and innovation in practical ways. The Student Innovation program (SIp) fosters growth by giving students the opportunity to engage with one another, faculty, and members of the wider global community involved in innovation. SIp collaborates with several on- and off-campus organizations and departments to coordinate campus-wide events, startup/innovation competitions, funding opportunities, coaching, mentorship, course instruction, targeted in-class presentations, incoming students and family presentations, and curriculum development.
SIp assists students in finding practical applications for their work and promotes the importance of moving research and innovation into society to solve the world's problems. The program personnel also advises several student organizations focused on enhancing the entrepreneurship ecosystem that currently exists at Georgia Tech.
This program coordinates the InVenture Prize, a faculty-led innovation competition for undergraduate students and recent BS graduates of Georgia Tech. This competition is one of the largest invention and startup competitions in the United States. It emboldens students with an entrepreneurial and inventive interest to apply their skills and see the world as endless opportunities. Students who participate in this program are provided with one-on-one mentors, coaching, and awards to encourage prototype development.
More information is available on the Student Innovation website.
ROTC
Georgia Tech offers three voluntary ROTC programs: Army, Navy, and Air Force.
Depending on the student's major, Basic and Advanced ROTC classes count as a portion of elective credit. (Students may apply a maximum of 4 credit hours in Basic ROTC courses and six credit hours in Advanced ROTC courses toward meeting the elective requirements for any degree at the discretion of the school.) Consult specific colleges to determine the amount of hours that will count toward a degree. After earning a baccalaureate degree and completing the Advanced ROTC courses for any of the three services, a student may receive a commission as an officer in either the reserve or active forces.
Students accepted into the program earn more than just money for a college degree. Cadets and midshipmen receive training and experience in the one quality which is always in great demand: Leadership.
Students may apply a maximum of 4 credit hours in basic (1000-2000 level courses) ROTC courses and six hours in advanced (3000-4000 level) ROTC courses toward meeting the free elective requirements for any degree. Students should begin taking basic ROTC courses during the first term they are enrolled. For further information, see individual curricula for the schools. Please note some departments may have stricter guidelines regarding ROTC courses.
Study Abroad
Georgia Tech sends more than 2,000 students abroad each Academic Year and offers more than 120 programs around the world. Study abroad programs span nearly every continent and academic discipline. Because students are able to take classes to fulfill their degree requirements, studying abroad gives students opportunities to improve their global competencies while meeting their academic goals.
Faculty-Led programs give students the opportunity to study as a group with faculty from Georgia Tech, with courses that are enhanced by an international experience.
Exchange programs give students the opportunity to attend international partner universities, where they take courses alongside students at the host institution and experience what it is like to study and live in another country. Students of all majors are eligible to participate in semester- or year-long exchange programs, and complete courses in English or in the language of the host country. Georgia Tech partners with more than 70 top-ranked universities around the world.
For more information on education abroad opportunities, visit oie.gatech.edu.
Summer Language Programs
Languages for Business and Technology (LBAT)
The School of Modern Languages offers special summer immersion programs in the countries/regions related to our areas of language study: Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish. These intensive programs in Languages for Business and Technology (LBAT) consist of study abroad in which classroom lessons in business, culture, and technology are combined with fieldwork, cultural events, excursions, and visits to area businesses, government agencies, and social concerns, all conducted in the target language. The professional visits provide students with firsthand experience of business life, the protocols and strategies of business and technology interactions, and a heightened awareness of the current economic and social issues facing the host country. The LBAT experience offers a unique opportunity for rapid growth in proficiency, for building a deeper appreciation for the cultures and lifestyle patterns of other peoples, and for making lifelong social and professional contacts.
Depending on the particular program, students will spend 6-8 weeks abroad and earn 9-15 semester hours at the 3000 level (with some programs including offerings at the 1000 or 2000 level); these credits often can count toward a certificate, a minor, or the joint majors offered by the School of Modern Languages. Program costs vary according to the country visited and the length of the program. The HOPE scholarship applies. See the School of Modern Languages' "LBAT Programs" web page for more information.
Transfer Programs
Dual Degree Program
Under the Dual Degree Program, students attend the participating Dual Degree school for three years and then come to Georgia Tech for approximately two years. Students participating in the Dual Degree Program may seek a degree from any undergraduate degree-granting program in the College of Engineering. Upon completion of the program, the student receives a bachelor's degree from the first school and a bachelor's degree in one of the engineering disciplines at Georgia Tech.
Participating in the Dual Degree Program are many of the schools in the University System of Georgia, including Morehouse College, Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University, and other historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) and predominantly women's colleges in the southeast. For additional information on either of these programs, contact the College of Engineering at Georgia Tech or the Regents' Engineering Transfer Program (RETP) or Dual Degree coordinator at a participating RETP or Dual Degree institution.
Regents' Engineering Transfer Program
The Regents' Engineering Transfer Program (RETP) is a cooperative program between Georgia Tech and colleges in the University System of Georgia.
For the first two years, students in this program attend one of the participating institutions, where they take all of the mathematics and science and many of the engineering courses required in the first two years of the Georgia Tech engineering curricula. Upon successful completion of the RETP requirements at the RETP institution, students are admitted to Georgia Tech to work toward completion of a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree.
By enrolling in RETP, students may attend a college close to home, thereby decreasing the cost of their education and easing the adjustment to college life. At the same time, RETP students enjoy many of the advantages of Tech students: they have equal access to engineering majors at Tech, they can participate in the co-op program, and they are invited to the Tech campus once a year for campus tours, information sessions, and meetings with advisors in their engineering majors.RETP Information

Vertically Integrated Projects Program
Through the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program, students work with faculty on large-scale, long term multidisciplinary project teams. Students earn academic credit and can participate for multiple semesters, with returning students taking on mentoring, leadership, and/or additional responsibilities relevant to their fields of study. “Vertical Integration” refers to team composition, with teams including sophomores, juniors, seniors, graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty. Faculty build VIP teams around their own interests, so they bring their expertise and enthusiasm to their teams. In turn, VIP teams attract students from many disciplines and enable the completion of ambitious projects, which strengthen and expand faculty portfolios. Teams are established by faculty request and last many years (if not indefinitely). Because each team lasts longer than any single student, new students get up to speed on the project each semester, and returning students help mentor newcomers. The long-term nature of the program provides the time and context for students to gain deeper insights into their field of study, acquire breadth by working with people from other disciplines and backgrounds, learn and practice professional skills, make substantial contributions to real-world projects and experience different roles and responsibilities on at team.
VIP is offered as a set of courses, with new students joining at the beginning of each semester. Students must apply to VIP before they can register for the appropriate courses. This ensures that returning students are able to register, and it allows VIP to maintain a balance of sophomores, juniors, seniors and graduate students as well as a balance of different majors on each team. The program actively recruits students prior to Phase I registration. Students can apply the semester before they join a team (for example, applying before Phase I registration to join a team the following semester), or as late as the first week of class for on-campus students or the month before class for online students (see www.vip.gatech.edu for deadlines). Teams do fill up, so students are encouraged to apply before Phase I registration if they are interested in a specific team.
In the application, students are asked to indicate which team they would like to join and how many credit-hours they would like to take. Sophomores are limited to 1 credit-hour. Juniors and seniors can take 1 to 2 credit-hours. Students using VIP to fulfill a multi-semester design sequence can take 3 credit-hours in their third semester of the sequence. Graduate students can take 1-3 credit-hours. Students who are being paid by an instructor to participate, such as undergraduate student employees and graduate student mentors, register for zero credits. This appears on the student schedules as a 1-credit audit courses. Students using VIP for the President’s Undergraduate Research Award program should indicate this on the application, and will register for 1-3 audit credits. Each applicant can only apply to one team at a time. If the team is unable to accept them, the student can apply to another team. If a student applies to another team while an application is pending, the new application will overwrite the previous application.
The VIP Program does not allow students to freely switch from team to team. As a disincentive, students are typically asked to take a one-semester break between participation on one team and another. Students seeking an exception to this rule should provide a detailed explanation in the comments section in the online application.
After students are accepted, the VIP Program will issue a registration permit. One-credit-hour students will need only one course registration number (CRN), which they will receive via email when their permit is issued. Two and 3-credit-hour students will need two CRNs, one for the scheduled meeting (1 credit, CRN emailed when the permit is issued), and another CRN for a 1 or 2-credit unsupervised lab. The lab CRNs are listed each semester on the VIP webpage.
Each VIP team meets once weekly, typically for 50 minutes. Teams also schedule subteam meetings, allowing smaller groups working on a specific topic to collaborate at other times during the week. Students in their first semester of VIP cannot have a time-conflict with the scheduled team meeting. Returning VIP students can have a time conflict with instructor approval, if subteam meetings outside of regular meetings would allow the student to fully participate and contribute. It is the student’s responsibility to confirm with the instructor if a time-conflict is acceptable (regardless of whether a time-conflict permit was issued), to ensure the time conflict is manageable, and to actively engage with their team.
Some VIP teams allow online students to participate. This is most common in the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program. Team listings on the VIP webpage indicate which teams will consider OMSCS students, either in general (synchronously), asynchronously or on a case-by-case basis. Online students interested in a team considering OMSCS applicants on a case-by-case basis should contact the instructor to discuss their interest and options. In other situations, students already associated with a VIP team might participate while doing a co-op, internship, or study abroad. These requests should be made to instructors. Then with instructor approval, the special sections will be created by the VIP Program.
Many departments have policies about how VIP credits can be applied to degree requirements. Some departments incentivize multiple semesters of participation, allowing VIP credits to count in a more useful way once a minimum number of credits are earned (e.g., all VIP credits might count as in-major electives once 6 VIP credits are earned). In some departments, VIP projects can be used to fulfill multi-semester design sequences such as Junior Design, Senior Design, or Studio. While departments develop and approve the policies, the VIP Program lists the policies at www.vip.gatech.edu for students’ convenience. It is important for each student to understand their department’s policy. Students with questions about their departments’ policies should contact their academic advisors in their home departments. Appeals to department policies are handled by students’ home departments.

BS/MS Degree Programs
Many schools at Georgia Tech offer BS/MS degree options that, like the Graduate Course Option, allow eligible students to use up to 6 credit hours of graduate-level coursework in the major discipline for both degrees. The BS/MS options typically include research and mentoring components and have their own GPA requirements. Note: A course can only be used twice. Courses shared with the major and minor are not eligible to apply toward a graduate degree.

Constitution and History: US and Georgia
|
|
Important Note:
On March 9, 2016, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia approved a revision to system-wide policies related to the Core Curriculum.
Constitution and History Requirements: US and Georgia
Georgia Code 32-171 states that “…no undergraduate student in any college or university shall receive a certificate of graduation or a degree without successfully completing course work or previously passing a satisfactory examination on the history of the United States and the history of Georgia, and upon the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Georgia.”
Pursuant to the above, all undergraduate students must satisfy four legislative requirements to graduate:
1. United States history.
2. Georgia history.
3. Provisions and principles of the United States Constitution.
4. Provisions and principles of the Constitution of Georgia.
These implementation requirements take effect with the 2022-2023 Catalog that is effective May 1, 2022. All incoming undergraduate students who first matriculate at Georgia Tech on or after May 1, 2022 will be required to follow these implementation requirements.
Completion of the legislative requirements is required for students to be eligible to graduate with Georgia Tech undergraduate degrees.
Below are options for satisfying these legislative requirements:
1. United States History
Course Credit. Receive credit for either of these courses taken at Georgia Tech or receive transferred credit for either course, or receive credit for either course awarded for a score on an Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) examination:
HIST 2111 The United States to 1877
HIST 2112 The United States since 1877
Satisfactory Examination. Earn a satisfactory score (60% or higher) on the United States History Module Examination before completing 90 or more credit hours. Information about this examination may be found at: https://oue.gatech.edu/glr-requirement
Transfer Transcript. Submit a transcript for transfer from another accredited institution to Georgia Tech. If the transfer institution is within the University System of Georgia or Technical College System of Georgia, submit a transcript that includes an indication of satisfaction of this legislative requirement, as determined by the Georgia Tech Registrar’s Office.
2. Georgia History
Satisfactory Examination. Earn a satisfactory score (60% or higher) on the Georgia History Module Examination before completing 90 or more credit hours. Information about this examination may be found at: https://oue.gatech.edu/glr-requirement
Transfer Transcript. Submit a transcript for transfer from another University System of Georgia or Technical College System of Georgia institution to Georgia Tech that includes an indication of satisfaction of this legislative requirement, as determined by the Georgia Tech Registrar’s Office.
3. Provisions and principles of the United States Constitution
Course Credit. Receive credit for any of these courses taken at Georgia Tech or receive transferred credit for any of these courses:
INTA 1200 American Government in Comparative Perspective
POL 1101 Government of the United States
PUBP 3000 American Constitutional Issues
Or receive credit for either of these courses awarded for a score on an Advanced Placement (AP) examination:
INTA 1200 American Government in Comparative Perspective
POL 1101 Government of the United States
Satisfactory Examination. Earn a satisfactory score (60% or higher) on the United States Constitution Module Examination before completing 90 or more credit hours. Information about this examination may be found at: https://oue.gatech.edu/glr-requirement
Transfer Transcript. Submit a transcript for transfer from another accredited institution to Georgia Tech. If the transfer institution is within the University System of Georgia or Technical College System of Georgia, submit a transcript that includes an indication of satisfaction of this legislative requirement, as determined by the Georgia Tech Registrar’s Office.
4. Provisions and principles of the Constitution of Georgia
Satisfactory Examination. Earn a satisfactory score (60% or higher) on the Constitution of Georgia Module Examination before completing 90 or more credit hours. Information about this examination may be found at: https://oue.gatech.edu/glr-requirement
Transfer Transcript. Submit a transcript for transfer from another University System of Georgia or Technical College System of Georgia institution to Georgia Tech that includes an indication of satisfaction of this legislative requirement, as determined by the Georgia Tech Registrar’s Office.
Social Science Attribute
Courses listed above that carry the Social Science attribute can serve both purposes.
Courses taken to satisfy Core Area E requirements (Social Sciences) can also be used to meet the Georgia Legislative Requirements. The courses(s) can serve both purposes. Note that, to satisfy Core Area E requirements, three hours must be obtained through completion of one of the following courses: HIST 2111, HIST 2112, POL 1101, INTA 1200, or PUBP 3000. HIST 2111 and HIST 2112 also satisfy the 'United States History' legislative requirement, and POL 1101, INTA 1200, and PUBP 3000 also satisfy the 'Provisions and Principles of the United States Constitution' legislative requirement.
The examinations to satisfy Georgia Legislative Requirements do not carry any academic credit.
The Georgia history and Constitution of Georgia legislative requirements can be met with transfer credit from another University System of Georgia or Technical College System of Georgia institution to Georgia Tech, as determined by the Georgia Tech Registrar’s Office. Should students from other accredited transfer institutions have completed courses with content that meet these requirements, and those courses are transferable, they will also be accepted to meet the Georgia history and Constitution of Georgia legislative requirements. The normal procedure for faculty review of transfer credit content will be followed to determine if courses from other accredited institutions meet these requirements.
All University System of Georgia institution transcripts list what legislative requirements the transferring student has met at their institution. Georgia Tech will honor this and note that the requirement is met in our records and credit will be given for transferable courses the student has completed.
Core Area A1
Core Area A1: Communication Outcomes
Area A1 is satisfied by completion of 6 credit hours as follows.
Required for all majors:
Effective Fall 2010, for freshmen entering the USG system Fall 2010, students who have earned 60 hours but have not completed Area A1 must enroll in the next course necessary to make progress toward completing this Area in every semester in which they take classes.
Effective Fall 2011, this hour limit is lowered to 45 hours for freshmen entering the USG system Fall 2011, Spring 2012, and Summer 2012.
Effective Fall 2012, the hour limit is lowered to 30 hours for freshmen entering the USG system Fall 2012 and thereafter.
|Code||Title||Credit Hours|
|ENGL 1101||English Composition I||3|
|ENGL 1102||English Composition II||3|
Core Area A2

|or MATH 1552||Integral Calculus|
- 1
In the case of a degree (major) that is jointly offered and the Colleges' requirements in this area are different, the student must complete the course that is specified in the curriculum for the degree, regardless of which college is the declared "home" of the student. This area of the Core Curriculum is driven by the requirements of the specific degree program, not by the general requirements of the College, if a degree is jointly offered.
Effective Fall 2010, for freshmen entering the USG system Fall 2010, students who have earned 60 hours but have not completed Area A2 must enroll in the next course necessary to make progress toward completing this Area in every semester in which they take classes.
Effective Fall 2011, this hour limit is lowered to 45 hours for freshmen entering the USG system Fall 2011, Spring 2012, and Summer 2012.
Effective Fall 2012, freshmen entering the USG system Fall 2012 and thereafter, the hour limit is lowered to 30 hours.
Core Area B
Core Area B: Institutional Options
Area B is satisfied by students completing the following:
|Code||Title||Credit Hours|
|CS 1301||Introduction to Computing 1||3|
- 1
Or another CS class designated by the School
Area B is satisfied by students completing the following:
|Code||Title||Credit Hours|
|CS 1301||Introduction to Computing 1||3|
Or another CS class designated by the School
Core Area C
Core Area C: Humanities, Fine Arts, and Ethics
Core Area C is satisfied by completion of 6 semester hours in courses that carry the HUM (Humanities) attribute. Fine Arts and some ethics related courses are included under Humanities at Georgia Tech. Courses that carry both the HUM and ETHS attribute can serve both purposes.
Notice:
On March 9, 2016 the Board of Regents approved a revision to Board of Regents policies related to the Core Curriculum.
Effective immediately:
1. Institutions will not be required to identify or track overlay requirements related to US Perspectives, Global Perspectives, and Critical Thinking.
2. Students will not be required to complete the overlay requirements from this point forward.
3. Students who are scheduled to graduate this semester and who have not completed the overlays may graduate without fulfilling this requirement.
Note:
- Any courses completed that were listed in prior catalogs as satisfying the humanities or ethics requirement and were completed while that catalog was in effect may also be used to satisfy this requirement.
- Academic units must formally request approval for courses they deem eligible to carry the Humanities attribute from the Institute Curriculum Committee and the University System of Georgia General Education Council.
- Humanities credit is awarded for Modern Languages 1001 classes upon successful completion of the corresponding 1002 classes. Humanities credit is awarded for SPAN 1001 only upon the successful completion of SPAN 1002. In some instances, students may complete a Modern Languages course at 1001 and then be placed at the second-semester level and complete the 2001 level course. Therefore, the sequence that will warrant HUM credit for Modern Languages courses may be either the 1001-1002 or the 1001-2001 sequence. Note: Any new Modern Languages course must be approved by the Institute Undergraduate Curriculum Committee and the University System of Georgia General Education Council to carry the Humanities attribute. The attribute is not automatically applied to new Modern Languages courses as new languages are introduced.
- Undergraduate Research courses numbered 2698, 2699, 4698, and 4699 cannot be used to fulfill requirements for humanities.
- Additional information on Music courses: Students can earn humanities credit for participation in ensembles.
- Humanities Credit for Ensemble Participation
Students can earn Humanities credit for participation in one or more specified School of Music ensembles. Each ensemble course is repeatable for credit and the following ensembles carry the humanities attribute:
Course List Code Title Credit Hours MUSI 3121 Concert Band 1 MUSI 3131 Symphonic Band 1 MUSI 3231 Chamber Choir 1 MUSI 3241 Chorale 1 MUSI 3251 Glee Club 1 MUSI 3261 Treble Choir 1 MUSI 3311 Jazz Ensemble 1 MUSI 3511 Percussion Ensemble 1 MUSI 3531 New Music Ensemble 1 MUSI 3551 Rock and Pop Ensemble 1 MUSI 3611 Symphony Orchestra 1
- Transfer Students:
Please be aware that when you see courses on your GT record that are listed with an "X" in the number (ECON 3XXX or JAPN 10X2, for example) it means that these are transfer courses and although they were not equated exactly with a GT course, they may have been accepted to meet a Core area such as Humanities and Social Science.
If you review your records in DegreeWorks, you will be able to see how your transfer credit applies to your GT degree program. Refer to your academic advisor for more information.

Regents' Testing Program
Effective Spring 2010
The Regents' exam is no longer required at Georgia Tech as a result of a recent decision by The Board of Regents'.
The Regents' exam is no longer required at Georgia Tech as a result of a recent decision by The Board of Regents'.
ROTC Credit
Georgia Tech offers three voluntary ROTC programs: Army, Navy, and Air Force.
Depending on the student's major, Basic and Advanced ROTC classes count as a portion of elective credit. (Students may apply a maximum of 4 credit hours in Basic ROTC courses and six credit hours in Advanced ROTC courses toward meeting the elective requirements for any degree at the discretion of the school.) Consult specific colleges to determine the amount of hours that will count toward a degree. After earning a baccalaureate degree and completing the Advanced ROTC courses for any of the three services, a student may receive a commission as an officer in either the reserve or active forces.
Students accepted into the program earn more than just money for a college degree. Cadets and midshipmen receive training and experience in the one quality which is always in great demand: Leadership.
Students may apply a maximum of 4 credit hours in basic (1000-2000 level courses) ROTC courses and six hours in advanced (3000-4000 level) ROTC courses toward meeting the free elective requirements for any degree. Students should begin taking basic ROTC courses during the first term they are enrolled. For further information, see individual curricula for the schools. Please note some departments may have stricter guidelines regarding ROTC courses.
SAT II Subject Tests
Students entering Georgia Tech may receive college credit based upon their scores on the College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Exams taken in conjunction with designated high school advanced placement classes, SAT II Subject Tests, The International Baccalaureate, and/or Georgia Tech Departmental Exams.
Once enrolled at Georgia Tech, students are not allowed to take College Board (Advanced Placement and SAT II), International Baccalaureate, or A-Level Examinations for credit. All examinations must be completed prior to the student's enrollment date. Students who offer satisfactory evidence that they are qualified to do so may receive credit for a course by examination at Georgia Tech. Such an examination is called an Examination for Advanced Standing.
**Note: On January 19th, 2021, College Board announced they would no longer be offering SAT Subject Test in the United States and internationally after June 2021. Georgia Tech will accept existing SAT II scores and those completed in 2021 until 2026.
The table below describes the course credit a student may earn if they achieve a specific score on a specific SAT II Subject Test.
|Subject||Score||Semester Course||Hours|
|Chemistry||680||CHEM 1211K||4|
|Chemistry||730||CHEM 1310||4|
|Literature||750||HUM 1XXX||3|

Seal of Biliteracy
2022-2023 Edition
Seal of Biliteracy
Georgia Institute of Technology does not award language credit for the Seal of Biliteracy.
Transfer Courses with 'X' Numbers
Transfer courses for which there is no exact Georgia Tech equivalent will be listed with the numbers 1XXX, 2XXX, etc. Courses so numbered can be used as free electives or may be substituted for Georgia Tech courses at the discretion of the academic unit. Transfer courses with an "X" as the secord or third number of the course (e.g., MATH 15X2) are lacking a component of the Georgia Tech course. These courses, in combination with another Georgia Tech course, may be considered as equivalent for prerequisite checking and degree requirements. Students should seek advisement from their academic unit regarding the use of these courses toward fulfilling degree requirements.
Transfer Credit
The basic policy regarding the acceptance of courses by transfer is to allow credit for courses completed with satisfactory grades ("C" or better) at other accredited colleges and universities in the United States and Canada, provided the courses correspond in time and content to courses offered at Georgia Tech. The Institute will not accept credit for courses successfully completed at another institution but previously taken at Georgia Tech unless the final grade received at Georgia Tech is a "W." The student must request and file an official transcript of transfer courses before the Institute can award credit. Coursework completed at colleges and universities outside the United States and Canada will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Transfer credit is not calculated in the Georgia Tech grade-point average.
Students may attend another institution as a transient student during terms when not enrolled at Georgia Tech. Students should discuss their course selection with their academic advisor to ensure transferability and applicability toward their degree programs. With the exception of officially sanctioned cross-enrolled programs, students are not to be enrolled at Georgia Tech and another institution during the same term without the specific approval the Institute Undergraduate Curriculum Committee or Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee, as appropriate.
Transfer Credit Policy
Policy on Transfer Credit
- Only official transcripts from other schools may be used to evaluate and/or award credit.
- New students must request that an official transcript from all previously attended colleges and universities be mailed to the Admissions Office.
-

Atlanta, GA 30332-0320
- The basic policy regarding the acceptance of the courses by transfer is to allow credit for courses completed with satisfactory grades (C or better) in other accredited colleges provided the courses correspond in time and content to courses offered at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Georgia Tech assumes responsibility for the academic quality of any work or credit recorded on the institution's transcript. Transfer credits will be accepted from newly-formed institutions of the University System of Georgia prior to accreditation.
- Georgia Tech will not award credit for courses successfully completed at another institution which were previously taken at Georgia Tech.
- A petition to the faculty must be approved to use course work more than ten years old.
- Georgia Tech reserves the right to test the proficiency of any student in course work transferred from other institutions and to disallow credit in courses in which the student cannot demonstrate acceptable proficiency.
Transfer Credit for Online Courses
Georgia Tech accepts credit for coursework as listed on the transfer equivalency table online at oscar.gatech.edu.
Requesting Transfer Credit for Courses Not Previously Evaluated
- Check the online equivalency database for updates. New evaluations are posted daily.
- Notify the Office of the Registrar's Transfer Credit Department of any not-awarded credit. Send an email to comments@registrar.gatech.edu
- Using the Transfer Credit web site, submit courses for evaluation.
About Transfer Credit
- Georgia Tech does not offer correspondence courses and does not grant credit for correspondence courses taken at other institutions. Academic units reserve the right to take such things as delivery method into consideration. For example, on-line courses and computer-instructed courses may not be accepted by some academic units for credit.
- Georgia Tech does not grant credit for the College Level General Educational Development Tests, CLEP, USAFI courses, or courses completed at any United States armed services, with the exception of the military academies and schools with full accreditation.
- Georgia Tech does not grant credit for professional certificate programs.
- The following items are among other circumstances in which non-resident credit is not granted:
- Courses previously completed at Georgia Tech.
- College courses taken to meet freshman admissions requirements.
- Remedial courses.
- Courses basically secondary school or pre-college level.
- Courses with essentially non-academic content.
- Vocational courses.
- Learning support courses.
- Non-resident credit is not computed as a part of the student's grade point average at Georgia Tech.
Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB)
For Advanced Placement (AP), visit the Advanced Placement page for more information.
For International Baccalaureate (IB), visit the International Baccalaureate page for more information.
Note: Once enrolled at Georgia Tech, students are not allowed to take College Board (Advanced Placement and SAT II), International Baccalaureate or A-Level Examinations for credit. All examinations must be completed prior the student's enrollment date. Students who offer satisfactory evidence that they are qualified to do so may receive credit for a course by examination at Georgia Tech. Such an examination is called an "Examination for Advanced Standing."
More information:
Undergraduate Students Taking Graduate Courses
A senior with a grade-point average (GPA) of at least 2.7 may enroll in a graduate course if she/he obtains permission from the school or department offering the course.
- Up to twelve credit hours earned as an undergraduate student may count toward earning a master's degree if the following conditions are satisfied.
- The student was in residence at Georgia Tech for at least two semesters before registering for the course(s).
- The student did not apply credit for the course toward a bachelor's degree. Special exceptions may apply in certain schools, as described below.
- If student pursues both a bachelor’s and master’s at Georgia Tech, and if both degrees are in the same discipline, she/he may apply up to six credit hours of graduate-level credit in the major discipline to satisfying the requirements for both degrees. Because some master’s degree programs do not have any unique undergraduate counterpart program, and because some master’s programs are offered by several schools, the definition of “discipline” will be broadly interpreted in such cases. To qualify for this option, a student must complete the bachelor's degree with a cumulative grade-point average (GPA) of 3.5 or higher, and she/he must complete the master’s degree within a two-year period following the award date of the bachelor’s degree. Note: A course can only be used twice. Courses shared with the major and minor are not eligible to apply toward a graduate degree.
Graduate Course Option
Students completing both a bachelor’s and master’s in the same discipline at Georgia Tech may use up to six credit hours of graduate-level coursework in the major discipline for both degrees. Recognizing that some master’s degree programs do not have a unique undergraduate counterpart program and that some master’s programs are offered by several schools, the term “discipline” in the prior sentence will be broadly interpreted in such cases. To qualify for this option, students must complete the undergraduate degree with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher and complete the master’s degree within a two-year period from the award date of the bachelor’s degree.
Many academic units have formalized using the Graduate Course Option between an undergraduate program and graduate program by creating BS/MS Options to allow eligible students to use up to 6 credit hours of graduate-level coursework in the major discipline for both degrees. The BS/MS options typically include research and mentoring components and have their own GPA requirements. These options must be formally requested through the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee. Note: A course can only be used twice. Courses shared with the major and minor are not eligible to apply toward a graduate degree.
See BS/MS Programs for specific BS/MS Option information.
New Sequence of Math Core Courses
Math Courses Redesigned for Fall 2015
The School of Mathematics announced a new sequence of math core courses starting Fall 2015. The change involved two primary goals which were:
- to separate the calculus and the linear algebra sequences and
- to improve the cutting points in the calculus sequence.
The old core sequence of calculus and linear algebra involved MATH 1501, and MATH 1502. However, a large portion of MATH 1502 was material from linear algebra.
In the new math core, the calculus material are covered in MATH 1551, and MATH 1552. The linear algebra material can be covered in one of three equivalent courses:
|Code||Title||Credit Hours|
|MATH 1553||Introduction to Linear Algebra||2|
|MATH 1554||Linear Algebra||4|
|MATH 1564||Linear Algebra with Abstract Vector Spaces||4|
More information can be found at http://www.math.gatech.edu, and questions can be addressed to academics@math.gatech.edu.

Graduate Admissions
Recruitment
Graduate Admissions
Prospective students may obtain information and apply for admission via the Graduate Studies website. The site provides information regarding minimum admission standards and relevant deadlines for individual programs.
Applicants for Georgia Tech's graduate programs should hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution and be able to demonstrate academic excellence. Students should also be able to demonstrate experience with their selected field of graduate studies such as an undergraduate degree in the field or work experience in a related job.
English Proficiency for International Students
All international students from countries in which English is not the primary native language must take an English-language-proficiency test, except international students who have attended a college or university in the United States for at least one academic year (two semesters or three quarters). The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic are the only tests accepted by Georgia Tech.
The minimum scores for graduate admission required by Georgia Tech are:
IELTS
7.0 Overall Band score and minimum Component Band scores of:
6.5 Reading
6.5 Listening
6.5 Speaking
5.5 Writing
TOEFL
- 577 (paper based), or
- 90 (Internet based) and minimum section scores of 19
Test scores are valid for a period of two years from the date of the exam. Scores must be valid at the start of the term in which you will matriculate.
Some academic programs require higher scores. (See the program(s) of choice in the degree program listing found at www.grad.gatech.edu to determine the minimum scores required by each program.) Since the results of this test constitute part of the material reviewed for admission to graduate study at Georgia Tech, students must arrange to have the Educational Testing Service or International English Language Testing System send their official scores to the Graduate Studies office as early as possible.
Admissions Information
Anyone who is qualified is welcome to seek admission to Georgia Tech, and anyone who applies for and accepts admission can be confident that the policy and regular practice of the Institute will not discriminate against him or her on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin.
Verification of credentials and certification of compliance with Institute admissions policies shall be the responsibility of the Office of Graduate Studies. Policies and procedures that are approved by the Office of the President, Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, and the Academic Faculty Senate of the Institute shall be applied in determining eligibility. From those eligible candidates, final admission decisions shall be the responsibility of the admitting department. Satisfying minimal standard does not guarantee admission, since the number of eligible applicants generally far exceeds the number of places available. As a result, many well-qualified applicants cannot be accommodated.
The criteria used in determining each applicant's eligibility for consideration shall include:
- Evidence of award of a bachelor's degree, its equivalent, or higher degree (prior to matriculation) from a regionally accredited institution; demonstrated academic excellence; and evidence of experience in the selected field of graduate study.
- For international applicants, satisfactory scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic test.
Departments make final admission decisions from the pool of eligible candidates based on a combination of factors, including academic degrees and records, the statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, test scores, and relevant work experience. Departments may also consider the appropriateness of the applicant's goals to the degree program in which they are interested and to the research interests of the program's faculty. In addition, consideration may be given to how the applicant's background and life experience would contribute significantly to an educationally beneficial mix of students.
Graduate Record Examinations (GRE)
Official GRE general test scores are required by most graduate programs and GRE subject test scores are required for some programs. Check the Graduate Studies website for test requirements in specific programs.
Official GRE general test scores are required by most graduate programs and GRE subject test scores are required for some programs. Check the Graduate Studies website for test requirements in specific programs.
Orientation - New Students
Each new graduate student should plan to attend one of the Institute's orientation sessions. Information on these sessions will be posted on the Graduate Studies website at www.grad.gatech.edu. In some cases, individual programs will also hold program orientations. New students should plan to attend both the Institute and the program orientation as the same information is not covered in these separate sessions.
Reactivation of Application
Applicants to a Georgia Tech graduate program who do not enter in the term for which they originally applied, and subsequently wish to be considered for a later term, must reactivate their applications for the new term by written request to the program to which they originally applied. Since the Graduate Studies office keeps files on never-entered students for one academic year only, students who delay more than one academic year in the reactivation request must reapply and provide a new set of application materials. The number of reactivations per applicant is limited.
Readmission
Students who interrupt the continuity of their graduate programs by not registering for three or more consecutive terms must seek readmission by filing a completed Request for Readmission form with the Registrar. Individuals who have received a graduate degree from Georgia Tech and who wish to reenter to receive an additional graduate degree (at the same level or higher) must confirm with the new major department whether or not a new application is necessary or if the student may apply through Readmission. Readmission forms are available from the Office of the Registrar. For more information, see the policy for withdrawal and readmission.
Students who have been out two or more terms will be required to meet health, lawful presence, and other certification requirements in effect at the time of readmission.
Types of Standing
Applicants holding a bachelor's degree in an appropriate field from a regionally accredited institution will be given full graduate standing upon acceptance and matriculation, provided their previous work is of sufficient quality to indicate immediate success in advanced study.
If the work of an applicant holding an approved bachelor's degree is deficient in content or quality so that supplemental study or demonstrated ability is necessary, the applicant may be given conditional graduate standing upon acceptance.
Applicants who do not wish to qualify for an advanced degree at Georgia Tech, but demonstrate the potential benefits of their participation in advanced study, may gain admission as special non-degree graduate students. Students who are admitted with special non-degree standing for failure to submit official transcripts or for other administrative reasons may apply not more than 16 semester credit hours taken on special non-degree standing toward a degree.
Graduate students in good standing at other U.S. universities may enroll at Georgia Tech as transient graduate students by filing an application for admission and by providing a letter of verification of good standing status from the registrar of the institution at which they are currently enrolled. Work undertaken in transient standing will not apply toward a Georgia Tech degree.
Undergraduate Admissions, not Graduate Studies, will admit students working toward a second bachelor's degree.
In addition to full, conditional, and special non-degree graduate standing, graduate students will be classified by academic standing according to their GPAs: good standing, warning, probation, or drop. (The graduate GPA includes the grades on all courses scheduled by the student after admission to graduate study.) For specific information, see the scholastic regulations.
Transfer of Credit
A student may not apply for transfer credit until after matriculation at Georgia Tech. The courses to be transferred would typically be those appearing on the approved program of study form for the masters degree. A doctoral student normally does not request transfer credit. The rules relative to and the process for obtaining transfer of credit for graduate-level courses are as follows:
- Student's in a master's degree program requiring fewer than 33 semester credit hours may receive up to six hours of transfer credit for graduate-level courses taken at an institution accredited by a Canadian or U.S. regional accrediting board, or at a foreign school or university that has a signed partner agreement with Georgia Tech, and not used for credit toward another degree.
A student in a master's degree program requiring 33 semester credit hours or more may receive up to nine hours of transfer credit for graduate-level courses taken at an institution accredited by a Canadian or U.S. regional accrediting board, or at a foreign school or university that has a signed partner agreement with Georgia Tech, and not used for credit toward another degree. The student must supply a current transcript for this evaluation.
- To obtain transfer of credit, the student must complete the following procedure:
- The student will confer with the graduate advisor to ascertain whether the courses to be transferred are a logical part of the student's graduate program;
- If the courses are appropriate, the student will deliver to the school that teaches such courses a copy of the current transcript, necessary descriptive materials including catalog descriptions, and textbooks used for evaluation. The faculty of the appropriate school will determine the equivalent Georgia Tech course and the number of credit hours accepted. The faculty member who prepares the transfer credit form should have the school chair cosign it. The school should then send the form directly to the registrar with a copy of the student's Approved Program of Study attached;
- If the student wishes to transfer more than the number of hours permitted in item one listed above, a petition must be submitted to the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee that includes statements of possible justification for the granting of such a petition, transfer credit forms, and the recommendation of the student's school chair.
- A joint enrollment student may receive graduate credit for up to one-third of the hours required for the degree for graduate courses taken at Emory University or Georgia State University provided that the following is true:
- Georgia Tech does not offer such courses;
- The student's advisor and school chair approve the courses in advance and in writing;
- The student passes the courses with a C or better. Advance approval is satisfied when the courses appear on the student's proposed Program of Study.
- A student may not receive transfer credit from universities outside the United States and Canada unless the courses were taken at a foreign institution or university that is accredited by a Canadian or U.S. regional accrediting board or has a signed partner agreement with Georgia Tech. In any other case, an international student can obtain credit for courses previously taken but not applied toward another degree by filling out an Examination for Advanced Standing Authorization Request Form, paying the appropriate fee at the Bursar's Office, and passing the examination for advanced standing. The school or college that normally teaches the equivalent course will administer any necessary examinations.
