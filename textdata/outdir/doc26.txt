Building Access
The Georgia Tech Security Card Access System (SCAS) is a campus-wide system that allows people to use their BuzzCard to access various buildings on campus. SCAS is operated by the Georgia Tech Police Department. FOM works with the Technology Services Organization (TSO) to manage access to College of Computing (CoC) and Klaus Advanced Computing (KACB) buildings. TSO is responsible for setting the automatic door schedules for CCB and KACB (e.g. some door areas are automatically locked during evening and weekend hours). BuzzCard accessible doors will either have a magnetic stripe reader or a proximity reader attached to them.
Based on your role within the CoC, you will be granted automatic default access (see Default Door Access table below) to certain door areas. A door area is a collection of one or more doors in a building. If you need door access to additional areas beyond your automatic allotment, you must seek sponsorship from a CoC faculty or staff member who, in turn, will request access from the steward of the door area. The door area steward will evaluate your request and authorize access if it is warranted.
