Change of Major Policies and Eligibility
All students must complete the mandatory Change of Major module to declare Computer Science as a major.
These modules are for matriculated students only.
You must be currently attending courses at Georgia Tech.
Double Majors: To double major, all major related courses in a student's primary major must be in progress or completed with a letter grade, with the exception of students pursuing a double major in CS and Math.
Core curriculum classes as defined by the University System of GA can still be outstanding.
Students can apply to graduate with their primary major but are responsible for canceling their active application for graduation to continue with Computer science as a secondary major. Consult with an advisor on how to cancel an active graduation application.
CS and Math double majors cannot do Modeling/Simulation or Theory as a Thread.
CS and EE/CMPE double majors cannot do Devices or Information Internetworks as a Thread.
Students can take computer science courses while not declared as a computer science major via normal registration procedures. See Computer Science registration website for details.
Students must be in good academic standing, meaning cannot be on Academic Warning, Probation, or Dismissal.
It is recommended that ALL students complete an intro computing course (CS1301/1315/1371) with a grade of “C” or higher before changing majors to CS. It is REQUIRED for sophomores-seniors changing majors into CS unless they are a transfer student or first semester freshman.
Transfer students must complete at least one semester at Tech and be in good Academic Standing before changing into Computer Science.
First Semester Freshmen must wait until the drop date has passed before applying to change their major to CS. First semester freshmen can still complete the change of major informational module to learn more about the CS major.
Transfer Students and First Semester Freshmen should review the institutional guidelines found here for more information.
All students are welcome to complete the Change of Major module for informational purposes.
Change of Major: Application Process and Procedures
Students must complete the module, application, and have been contacted by a member of the CoC advising team, and submit the required documentation in collaboration with the CoC advising team in order to complete the Change of Major process.
The Change of major process is as follows:
- Complete the module and application during the application window that is posted on the website (at the end of the next section).
- Wait until a member of the advising team has reached out to you via email as they will give you further instructions on how to complete the process.
- Complete the process according to the emailed instructions provided by the advisor.
Note: There is no change of major meeting and forms sent to advisors outside of this posted procedure will not be processed, even if the module has been completed.
- After completing the module, students may submit a Change of Major Form up until the end of the current academic year (Summer-Fall-Spring). A new academic year begins each summer and students are required to complete the module AND application again once a new academic year begins.
- Only eligible students, or students who meet current change of major requirements, should complete the COM form.
Please note that all applications are subject to approval at the discretion of the CS department, which may include criteria not available to the public.
General inquiries should go to advising@cc.gatech.edu.
