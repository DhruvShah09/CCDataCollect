Corporate Recruiting
Given the pressures facing both graduating students and the companies trying to hire them, the College of Computing devotes much attention to preparing its students for the job world. At the Institute level, Georgia Tech’s Center for Career Discovery is a campus-wide career services operation that links corporate recruiters with students of all majors.
At the College of Computing, we have formed our own Office of Career Services that is finely attuned to the particular needs of companies and recruiters seeking top-notch computing talent. We hold multi-day Career Fairs twice each year, once in the fall and again in the spring, as well as virtual career fairs, that are widely attended both by undergraduate and graduate students.
Our Career Services team also provides critical support for students by way of 1x1 career counseling, training for things like interviewing and resume preparation, and other services.
You can work with both career offices in parallel. Click the links below to learn more about how the College prepares our students for the professional world—and how you can benefit from that preparation.
