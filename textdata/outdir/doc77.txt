Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
Computer science is the base for countless industries and disciplines. Today’s employers need graduates with both a solid foundation in the principles of computer science and specialized computing skills and backgrounds — individuals with a generalist’s knowledge, but an expert’s eye for innovation and problem-solving.
It only makes sense that computer science education reflects this reality. The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) program at the Georgia Tech College of Computing prepares students to leave school with the tools needed to become innovators and global leaders in computing.
If you are interested in the ways that computing can help define your world, apply to the BSCS program.
