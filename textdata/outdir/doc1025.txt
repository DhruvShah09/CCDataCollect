Recruiting from the College of Computing
Let’s Get Started!
Twice each academic year, in September and in January, the College of Computing hosts the opportunity to network and recruit College specific student talent . Accommodating between 120 and 160 companies, an average of 1,500 undergraduate and graduate students attend each event. Booths for these events must be reserved and fills up almost immediately.
If you’d like to receive notice of when we begin accepting GT Computing Career Fair recruiter reservations, we can take care of that, too. Please contact Paul Schultz, Assistant Director of Development, at Pschultz@cc.gatech.edu or 404-385-5468.
For companies who miss registration or could not attend the GT Computing Career Fair, the College holds virtual career fairs, which are open to our students and alumni.
Advertising internships & co-ops
While Georgia Tech recognizes both co-op opportunities and internships, computing students are fast-moving and prefer internships. You can post your internship opportunities on the College’s jobs board hosted on Handshake. This a preferred way of attracting applicants for your computing positions. Students understand that this job board is all computing, all the time, and many look there first for internship opportunities (you can also post permanent positions, as well).
As a last thought, although we have one of the largest enrollments in the United States, we also are deluged with employers seeking our talent. The most successful employers take advantage of our Corporate Affiliates Program, allowing a longer-term opportunity to increase your visibility and build a brand among our career-motivated students.
