Biography
Dr. Catrambone's research interests include:
- Creating examples to help learners form meaningful and generalizable solution procedures. I and the students in my lab have explored this issue in domains ranging from probability and physics to ballet.
- The use of task analysis techniques for identifying what a person needs to learn in order to solve problems or carry out procedures in some domain.
- Using information from task analyses to guide the construction of teaching and training materials including computer-based (multimedia) instructional environments.
- Exploring technology such as animations and embodied conversational agents (ECAs) for improving interfaces and helping people learn and carry out tasks more easily.
- Analogical Reasoning
