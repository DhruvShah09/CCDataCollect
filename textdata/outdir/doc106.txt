Division of Computing Instruction
The Division of Computing Instruction (DCI) is the home of the College of Computing’s Lecturer-track Faculty. DCI faculty are the primary instructors for the introductory courses which Computer Science and Computational Media students take during their first and second years. A select few of the College’s upper division courses are also taught by DCI faculty.
With the requirement that each Georgia Tech student complete an introductory programming course, DCI’s footprint extends far beyond the College. Each semester, the unit ultimately teaches thousands of students across several majors and manages hundreds of undergraduate teaching assistants.
DCI coordinates with the schools, as well as other units on campus, to ensure that Georgia Tech students receive the very highest quality education. The unit also organizes the biannual College Capstone Expo, which is a showcase of software design projects completed by Junior and Senior Computer Science and Computational Media students.
It is separate and independent from the schools within the College, and the Director of DCI reports directly to the Dean of the College.
