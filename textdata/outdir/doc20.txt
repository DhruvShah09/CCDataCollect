Apply Now - Berlin
Could you please replace the current paragraph with the following?:
The program accepts approximately 60 students for participation for each summer – and applications will be reviewed in the order they are received – so we recommend applying early to ensure a spot! The application cycle opens on the first day of the preceding Fall semester (August) and runs through the application deadline until the program is filled. Applications are considered complete when a student has submitted the application materials and paid the application fee through Atlas, Georgia Tech’s online application portal for education abroad programs. Once the Berlin program fills, students with continued interest can remain on a wait list, which will be updated throughout the fall and spring
