Biography
Dhruv Batra is an Associate Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech and a Research Director in the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team at Meta.
His research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and AI. The long-term goal of his research is to develop agents that “see” (or more generally perceive their environment through vision, audition, or other senses), “talk” (i.e. hold a natural language dialog grounded in their environment), “act” (e.g. navigate their environment and interact with it to accomplish goals), and “reason” (i.e., consider the long-term consequences of their actions).
He is a recipient of the 2019 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), the 2018 Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers by the US Army (ECASE-Army), the 2017 Office of Naval Research (ONR) Young Investigator Program (YIP) award, the 2014 National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award, the 2014 Army Research Office (ARO) Young Investigator Program (YIP) award, Outstanding Junior Faculty awards from Virginia Tech College of Engineering in 2015 and Georgia Tech College of Computing in 2018, multiple research awards from industry (Google, Amazon, Facebook), Carnegie Mellon Dean's Fellowship in 2007, and several best paper awards and nominations (CVPR 2022, ICCV 2019, EMNLP 2017, ICML workshop on Visualization for Deep Learning 2016, ICCV workshop Object Understanding for Interaction 2016) and teaching commendations at Virginia Tech. His research is supported by NSF, ARO, ARL, ONR, DARPA, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. Research from his lab has been extensively covered in the media (with varying levels of accuracy) at CNN, BBC, CNBC, Bloomberg Business, The Boston Globe, MIT Technology Review, Newsweek, The Verge, New Scientist, and NPR.
