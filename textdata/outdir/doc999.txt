Ph.D. CS Admissions Requirements
The application deadline for the Ph.D. in Computer Science is December 15th. The basic requirements for admission to the program are as follows:
- General Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are optional. Recently, accepted applicant scores have averaged 80%, 90+%, 90+% respectively on the verbal, quantitative and analytical sections.
- The desirable minimum undergraduate GPA is 3.5/4.0.
- The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) test is required for candidates whose native language is not English and who have not studied in the United States for at least one year. The required minimum is 600 (paper test) or 250 (computer test); however, most candidates are well above this score.
- We will also accept IELTS beginning in Spring 2020. A minimum overall score of 7.5 is required, with minimum section scores as follows: Reading 6.5, Listening 6.5, Speaking 6.5, Writing 5.5.
- Completion of the online application
The application requires three recommendation letters from people closely acquainted with the student about academic competence. Letters from the academic community are preferred.
In general, there are many more qualified applicants than there are places in the program. The challenge for the College every year is to select a class from a very qualified pool. The College looks for compelling reasons to admit candidates. We welcome all pertinent information that would assist us in making an objective and informed decision on your admission.
All application materials should be submitted to the Institute's Graduate Admissions Office and must be received by the application deadline to ensure adequate consideration of your application.
*Note that our Master's (M.S.) program is separate from our Ph.D. program. If the eventual degree you seek is a Ph.D., you will need to apply directly to the doctoral program.
Ph.D. candidates are typically offered a research or teaching assistantship which includes a stipend and tuition remission.
The Master's program does not offer financial aid to the majority of students. Aid will be based on qualifications for the program, not need.
