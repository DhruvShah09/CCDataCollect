Intelligence
Build top-to-bottom models of rational agents and human-level intelligence.
The Intelligence thread is concerned with top-to-bottom computational models of intelligence. To this end, we emphasize designing and implementing artifacts that exhibit various levels of intelligence as well as understanding and modeling natural cognitive agents such as humans, ants, or bees. Students acquire the technical knowledge and skills necessary for expressing, specifying, understanding, creating, and exploiting computational models that represent cognitive processes. The Intelligence thread prepares students for fields as diverse as artificial intelligence, machine learning, perception, cognitive science, and countless fields in which these areas of computational intelligence are applied.
The student who pursues Intelligence can combine it with Devices to become a roboticist, with People to build adaptive interfaces, or with Media to build smart and adaptive entertainment - to name a few of the far-reaching possibilities.
