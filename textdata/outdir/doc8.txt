Media
Build systems to exploit computing's abilities to provide creative outlets.
The Media thread prepares students by helping them to understand the technical and computational capabilities of systems in order to utilize their abilities to provide creative outlets.
The student who pursues Media can combine it with Intelligence to study real-time animation, Information Internetworks to build high performance database systems, or with People to explore visualization of high-bandwidth data streaming. Media provides a creative pairing for any thread combination.
