Minor in Computational Data Analysis
The College of Computing offers a minor in Computational Data Analysis for students in other disciplines who are looking to combine their area of study with the mathematical and statistical background to develop and apply data analysis techniques to real world datasets.
General Requirements:
- Must be in good academic standing (Student is not on academic warning or probation; is maintaining satisfactory academic progress.)
- CS 1301, CS 1315, or CS 1371 must be completed with an “A” or “B” before applying for the Minor in Computational Data Analysis.
- CS 1331 must be completed with an “A” or “B” before applying for the Minor in Computational Data Analysis.
- Mathematics through Calculus III must be completed before applying for the Minor in Computational Data Analysis.
- Students must have a minimum of 48 credit hours remaining (not including minor prerequisites and required coursework) in your major degree requirements, as seat availability in CS classes is limited
- All courses must be completed with a letter-grade of “C” or better
- 9 hours must be 3000/4000 level
- Course prerequisites are not a part of the minor; it is the student’s responsibility to account for all required prerequisites understanding that they are also subject to change.
- If the students’ major requires any of the minor courses listed below, the student should communicate with the minor advisor for course substitutions.
- Computational Media, Computer Engineering (catalog year 2021-2022 and later), Computer Science, and Industrial Engineering majors cannot minor in Computational Data Analysis.
