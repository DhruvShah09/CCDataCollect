GVC Area - Rendering
Scope
Rendering is the process of creating images from scene descriptions. Relevant topics in this area include image sampling, anti-aliasing, texture synthesis, texture mapping, shadows, scan conversion, radiance, light fields, BRDF's (surface reflectance), ray tracing, radiosity, the reflectance equation, the rendering equation, photon mapping, volume rendering, image-based rendering, non-photorealistic rendering, pre-computed radiance transfer and GPU programming.

Sample Questions
- Describe the meaning of the terms pre-filtering, sampling, and reconstruction of digital signals as they relate to aliasing.
- Define radiance, light field, BRDF. What are the relations between these in a given static scene?
- What is the reflectance equation? What do each of the symbols in it mean? How do we approximate it in standard Whitted-style ray tracing? What aspects of it are neglected in standard ray-tracing?
- What effects can be captured using distribution ray tracing? How are each of these effects related to aliasing, if at all? What lighting effects will distribution ray tracing NOT capture.
- What are the properties of Perlin noise? How can one generate it? Give two specific examples of using it to make solid textures.
- Describe a simple scene with diffuse polygons and diffuse lights. Set up the matrix system that is used to calculate radiosity for your scene, being as specific as possible.
- Describe in detail a ray tracing based rendering system that captures diffuse illumination effects of the kind that radiosity produces. What are likely noticeable artifacts (errors) of the approach that you describe and what might be done to overcome them?
- What are the speed and quality tradeoffs between the various volume rendering techniques that you know? Describe these strengths and weaknesses for as many ways as you can for volume rendering.
- Describe a particular image-based rendering system. Discuss aliasing issues that can arise in the system and describe several potential ways to improve the image quality.
