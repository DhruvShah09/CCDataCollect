Apply Now - Barcelona
The program accepts approximately 60 students for participation for each summer – and applications will be reviewed in the order they are received – so we recommend applying early to ensure a spot! The application cycle opens on the first day of the preceding Fall semester (August) and runs through the application deadline (November 15) or until the program is filled. Applications are considered complete when a student has submitted the application and deposit through Atlas, Georgia Tech’s online application portal for education abroad programs. Once the Barcelona program fills, students with continued interest can remain on a wait list, which will be updated throughout the fall and spring. Application deposits may be refunded if a student is not accepted into the program or chooses to be removed from the wait list. The program’s full policy on cancellations and refunds can be viewed on the program’s application page in Atlas.
