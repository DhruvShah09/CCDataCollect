The College of Computing’s Undergraduate Degree Programs
With its unique Threads curriculum, the College of Computing provides undergraduate students a world-class education through one of our three-degree programs: Computer Science, Computational Media, or Computer Engineering. Make your degree "you" by combining standard computer science education with classes tailored to your interests and real-world opportunities.
B.S. Computer Science
B.S. Computer Science
Computer science is the base and platform for countless industries and disciplines. Today’s employers need graduates with both a solid foundation in the principles of computer science and specialized computing skills and backgrounds — individuals with a generalist’s knowledge, but an expert’s eye for innovation and problem-solving.
It only makes sense that computer science education reflects this reality. The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at the College of Computing prepares students to leave school with the tools needed to become innovators and global leaders in computing.
B.S. Computational Media
B.S. Computational Media
The Bachelor of Science in Computational Media program was developed in recognition of computing’s significant role in communication and expression and is a joint offering between the College of Computing and the School of Literature, Media, and Communication within the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and the School of Music within the College of Design.
Students gain both theoretical and hands-on knowledge of computing while developing an in-depth understanding of visual design, music technology, or the history of media.
B.S. Computer Engineering
B.S. Computer Engineering
The Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering program is a joint offering between the College of Computing and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering within the College of Engineering and covers a broad set of areas, ranging from the design of microprocessors to cloud computing and everything in between.
Students who major in computer engineering will learn about hardware, software, and computing principles in the context of important devices and systems such as smartphones, the Internet of Things, streaming systems, and large-scale computing and storage systems for the cloud.
More Than a Degree
GT Computing is about more than just classes and degrees – a lot more. We are a global computing community, and our members range from middle-schoolers enrolled in summer camps to some of the world's top CEOs, along with everyone in between.
