People
Design, build, and evaluate systems that treat humans as the central component.
The People thread is where computing meets users. This thread prepares students by helping them to understand the theoretical and computational foundations for designing, building, and evaluating systems that treat the human as a central component.
The student who pursues the People thread can combine it with Devices to study human-robot interaction, Information Internetworks to pursue research in data visualization, Intelligence for learning sciences and technology, Systems & Architecture to explore ubiquitous computing, or various other combinations.
