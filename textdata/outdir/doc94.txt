Minor in Scientific Engineering and Computing
The College of Computing offers a minor in Scientific Engineering and Computing for students in other disciplines who are looking to augment their major with computational and numerical knowledge.
General Requirements:
- Must be in good academic standing (Student is not on academic warning or probation; is maintaining satisfactory academic progress.)
- CS 1301, CS 1315, or CS 1371 must be completed with an “A” or “B” before applying for the Minor in Scientific Engineering and Computing.
- CS 1331 must be completed with an “A” or “B” before applying for the Minor in Scientific Engineering and Computing.
- Mathematics through Differential Equations must be completed before applying for the Minor in Scientific Engineering and Computing.
- Students must have a minimum of 48 credit hours remaining (not including minor prerequisites and required coursework) in your major degree requirements, as seat availability in CS classes is limited
- All courses must be completed with a letter-grade of “C” or better.
- 9 hours must be 3000/4000 level.
- Course prerequisites are not a part of the minor; it is the student’s responsibility to account for all required prerequisites understanding that they are also subject to change.
- No Special Problems or Internship coursework may be used towards any CS minor.
- If the students’ major requires any of the minor courses listed below, the student should communicate with the minor advisor for course substitutions.
- Computational Media, Computer Engineering (catalog year 2021-2022 and later), and Computer Science majors cannot minor in Scientific Engineering and Computing.
