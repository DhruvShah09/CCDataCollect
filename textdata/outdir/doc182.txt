Office of Community and Student Engagement
The Office of Community and Student Engagement’s mission is to create a sustainable pipeline of computer science talent from elementary school through alumni.
The office works toward this goal through the areas of emphasis found in our name: outreach, enrollment, and community. From career fairs to mentorship programs, from student organizations to community building, the Office of Community and Student Engagement will help you find your home and your path in the College of Computing. Pay a visit to the team's offices and you’ll see the GT Computing community in action.
