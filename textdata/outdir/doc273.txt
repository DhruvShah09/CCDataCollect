Biography
I am a professor in the School of Interactive Computing, and associate dean in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the application of empirical methods to inform the design and evaluation of technologies. Prior to joining the faculty at Georgia Tech, I was a member of Research Staff at Bell Laboratories and in the Computer Science Laboratory at Xerox PARC. I was elected to the CHI Academy in 2012 for my sustained contributions to the field of HCI.
