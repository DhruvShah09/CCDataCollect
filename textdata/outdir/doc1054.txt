Undergraduate Research
Research: Not Just for Grad Students
Doing undergraduate research is the single best way to help your career. The Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Computing (UROC) program can help you get involved through:
- Job fairs, where you can hear about available research jobs
- A spring research symposium, where you can show off your work and win up to $500 in prizes
Students should also be aware of the campus-wide undergraduate research program, UROP. Campus UROP sponsors helpful seminars, a campus-wide research symposium, and the PURA awards to provide funding for research and conference travel if you get a paper accepted.
Research Option
Georgia Tech's Research Option is a special undergraduate program for those who want to develop the research skills and experience that will make a grad school or job application really stand out. It facilitates relationships between faculty and students and allows you to learn about an area of research in greater depth. Completion of Research Option is noted on the student's transcript.
Students in the College of Computing participate in Research Option via the UROC program. Research Option is offered for both Computer Science and Computational Media degrees.
