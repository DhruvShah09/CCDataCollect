Modeling & Simulation
Represent Natural and Physical Processes
The Modeling & Simulation thread is intended for students interested in developing a deep understanding and appreciation of how natural and human-generated systems such as weather, biological processes, supply chains, or computers, can be represented by mathematical models and computer software. Such models are widely used today to better understand and predict the behavior of such systems.
Because these models are often described and represented by mathematical expressions, and the models themselves often deal with physical phenomena, a background in mathematics and the sciences is required. Combining this background with a knowledge in computer science will yield the basic tools necessary to transform abstract conceptual models to computer programs that execute efficiently on digital machines. The required coursework in Modeling & Simulation includes topics in continuous and discrete mathematics, the sciences, and computing. Elective courses enable students to further develop and apply their knowledge and skills to a specific discipline where Modeling & Simulation plays an important role.
The student who pursues Modeling & Simulation can combine it with Intelligence to become a data miner, or with Media to build visualizations of large amounts of scientific data, or People to build work flow systems for scientists who aren't computing experts to use. The possibilities are endless.
