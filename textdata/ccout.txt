Computing Alum Spotlights Theater Community’s Economic Struggle
Although many businesses have reopened following the spring shutdown, performing arts venues mostly have not. Because of this, people working in the arts have been among the hardest-hit workers during the pandemic.
Workers in Atlanta’s theater community have certainly had to face this challenge as well. Shuttered box offices, canceled productions, and darkened stages have meant little to no work for thousands of people who make their living through the performing arts in venues across the metro area.
“Very little is being done in Atlanta. Everyone from stagehands to actors to parking attendants and all of the others that help make a performance happen are having a really tough time right now,” said Atlanta photographer and GT Computing alumnus Michael Boatright (BS ICS 82 COOP).
“Some stages have grant-type support, which is helping to make rent, but the entertainment industry as a whole is struggling.”
To help rally support for Atlanta’s theater community, Boatright has launched a new photographic exploration called Dark Houses Atlanta, which is now available online.
The visual story documents darkened theaters across metro Atlanta including the Fabulous Fox Theatre, Actor’s Express, and Georgia Tech’s Ferst Center for the Performing Arts. Boatright photographed each stage location as it was, with the set that was in place when the performers and crew left.
“There’s nothing like seeing 4,000 empty seats to help you realize how much you miss being there with a full house,” said Boatright.
He added that it’s important to spotlight the issue for people that are not directly impacted.
“While the theater has survived plagues, social upheaval, and economic hardships, it will need lots of support from the community to survive all three at the same time.”
Boatright began the Dark Houses Atlanta project by first shooting the main stage at the Ferst Center because of his Georgia Tech connection. Along with being an alumnus, he has also been photographing preview performances for DramaTech – Georgia Tech’s student-run theater – for the past six years.
DramaTech is the longest continuously running theater company in the southeastern United States. In March, Boatright emailed asking about the troupe’s upcoming show.
“Of course, they were all very bummed, especially the graduating seniors, it would have been their last show,” said Boatright.
However, rather than canceling altogether, the students decided to put on the show with half-built sets and incomplete technical elements.
“I shot the performance but it was tough; I was crying the whole time because the students played their hearts out. I have never been more proud of a group of people, and I know our future is in good hands with graduating students like that,” said Boatright.

Modeling & Simulation
Represent Natural and Physical Processes
The Modeling & Simulation thread is intended for students interested in developing a deep understanding and appreciation of how natural and human-generated systems such as weather, biological processes, supply chains, or computers, can be represented by mathematical models and computer software. Such models are widely used today to better understand and predict the behavior of such systems.
Because these models are often described and represented by mathematical expressions, and the models themselves often deal with physical phenomena, a background in mathematics and the sciences is required. Combining this background with a knowledge in computer science will yield the basic tools necessary to transform abstract conceptual models to computer programs that execute efficiently on digital machines. The required coursework in Modeling & Simulation includes topics in continuous and discrete mathematics, the sciences, and computing. Elective courses enable students to further develop and apply their knowledge and skills to a specific discipline where Modeling & Simulation plays an important role.
The student who pursues Modeling & Simulation can combine it with Intelligence to become a data miner, or with Media to build visualizations of large amounts of scientific data, or People to build work flow systems for scientists who aren't computing experts to use. The possibilities are endless.

Theory
Discover the theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines.
The Theory thread is where computing models and addresses scaling. Theory quantifies, in mathematical terms, the efficiency by which problems are solved, as problem instances grow in size.
In the Theory thread, students study abstractions of universal computational models, complexity classes within which many natural problems fall, and abstract methods to design efficient algorithms and analyze algorithmic performance. Early preparation includes introduction to programming, discrete math, proof techniques, algorithms and complexity. The student who pursues the Theory thread will eventually learn to formally quantify and improve performance either within theoretical computer science, or within an applied area of computer science, or in another science with a clear computational component (such as computational biology, physics, economics, mathematics, optimization etc).
A student can combine Theory with Information Internetworks to enhance and quantify the performance of networks or databases or pursue security and cryptography, or with Systems & Architecture to design programming languages or build provably efficient systems and software, or with Modeling & Simulation to solve, with proven rigor, a wide range of real-world large scale problems. A student who pursues Theory can combine it with any other thread and enhance those skills with a deep quantitative understanding of performance of the objects studied in the other thread. In addition, in any application related work environment, from a research or development lab, to a consulting firm or the stock market, ability to design tools, reason about them formally, and quantify performance is a skill that greatly enhances one's vita.
A student who pursues the theory thread at Georgia Tech is also an excellent candidate for a Ph.D. in theoretical computer science.

TSO is responsible for setting the automatic door schedules for CCB and KACB (e.g. some door areas are automatically locked during evening and weekend hours). BuzzCard accessible doors will either have a magnetic stripe reader or a proximity reader attached to them.
Based on your role within the CoC, you will be granted automatic default access (see Default Door Access table below) to certain door areas. A door area is a collection of one or more doors in a building. If you need door access to additional areas beyond your automatic allotment, you must seek sponsorship from a CoC faculty or staff member who, in turn, will request access from the steward of the door area. The door area steward will evaluate your request and authorize access if it is warranted.

College of Computing Previews Institute Address
Thursday, President G.P. “Bud” Peterson will present the 2016 Institute Address, during which he will highlight recent Georgia Tech achievements, share his vision and goals for the new school year, and engage in an open Q and A session.
As part of the preparation for the address, the College of Computing had the opportunity to share some of its recent achievements with the president. With limited time, however, and so many notable things happening across campus, there is no way to know what will make it into the presentation.
Therefore, we thought you might like to see the College of Computing slides presented to President Peterson.
Of course, the slides below are just a glimpse of the dynamic people, innovative research, and worthwhile results at #GTComputing. You can keep up with all of this and more by following the College of Computing on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
The full script and slide presentation for the 2016 Institute Address is available on the president's website.
College of Computing Reveals Social Media Contest Winners
No matter where Georgia Tech computing takes you, the adventure never ends! This was the theme of the recently concluded #GTComputingAdventures social media contest sponsored by the College of Computing.
The contest launched June 15 and wrapped up Aug. 10. In that time, more than 150 photos from as far away as Patagonia and Kathmandu were shared to the College’s Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts using the hashtag, #GTComputingAdventures. Each person entering the photo contest will receive a t-shirt designed for the competition.
Two grand prize winners were also selected: one for the photo taken the farthest away from Georgia Tech, and one for the photo with the most likes. These winners will each receive a set of Beats by Dre headphones.
And the winners are…
OMS CS student Genevieve Hayes, aka @murderandagnst, shared the photo taken farthest away from campus. Posted on Twitter, her winning picture of the State Library of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia was taken 9,682 miles away from Georgia Tech.
Taken not quite so far away, the photo entry that earned the most likes depicts a view from Little Si, a mountain in Washington. Shared by Sana Ajani, a third-year Georgia Tech computer science major, this image earned 133 likes on Instagram. @comic_sana, as Ajani is known on Instagram, was in Washington this summer working as an Explorer Intern at Microsoft.
With the success of this summer’s contest, the College of Computing is planning another #GTComputingAdventures contest for next year. Until then, the College encourages students, alumni, faculty, and staff to share their photos and adventures using the hashtag, #GTComputing.

Computing Ranks Well for Gender Diversity Says Industry Report
A recent industry report finds that Georgia Tech is doing comparatively well when it comes to the gender diversity of its computer science (CS) faculty.
The report from CrowdStrike, a global cybersecurity company, says that Georgia Tech ranks second in the U.S. for gender diversity among CS faculty. According to the report, women comprise 23.8 percent of the CS faculty at Georgia Tech.
“Pushing forward on gender equity is a top strategic driver for the College and the Institute so I’m pleased that we have ranked well in this report. There is still much to be done, but this is solid evidence that our efforts to even the playing field are paying off, and that we are moving in the right direction,” said Charles Isbell, Georgia Tech dean of computing and John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
In the report, Duke University ranks first with women making up 27.4 percent of its CS faculty. Harvard University ranks third with 23.7 percent female CS faculty. The U.S. average is 18.7 percent.
The analysis examined faculty listings on websites for the top 25 CS schools as ranked in U.S. News and World Report’s 2018 graduate program rankings. It included data for professors, instructors, and researchers, but does not include staff members.
The reasons for bringing attention to gender diversity in computer science are clear. The CrowdStrike report references data from a recent Microsoft survey that showed that women are 52 percent more likely to stay in STEM fields if they have a female role model.
According to the report, “The fewer female computer science academics there are, the less likely female students are to continue to study computer sciences, graduate with a computer sciences degree and go on to inspire other females to do so.”
“I’m exceedingly proud of our female faculty members. The mentorship, leadership, and guidance they provide, and the example they set, are vitally important to the ongoing success of our female students at every level,” said Isbell.
Along with this encouraging news about faculty gender diversity, the College is also seeing positive growth in female student enrollments.
Nationally, 18 percent of undergraduate CS majors are women. According to enrollment data, 27 percent of CS majors at Georgia Tech are women. The percentage of female CS Ph.D. students nationally is 21 percent, while at Tech 24 percent of CS Ph.D. students are female.
Overall, total female enrollment in B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. programs, has grown from 16 percent of GT Computing students a decade ago to 21 percent today. This equates to 31 percent growth in female enrollment in the College over the past decade.
CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Georgia Tech College of Computing alumnus.

Cassie Mitchell: An Assistant Professor Pioneering Research in Predictive Medicine While Chasing Paralympic Gold
On her desk sits a sign that says “Never, never, never give up.” There could not be a more fitting sign for Cassie Mitchell to have on display. A former track star with dreams of becoming an orthopedic surgeon, Mitchell is now an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech. She is also a Paralympic medalist. It’s not exactly the path she would have chosen herself, but she’s proud of it.
From Cowgirl to City Slicker
To many of Mitchell’s friends and family back home in Oklahoma, she is an “animal whisperer.” She always seems to know what to do with animals, including calming down a 2,000-pound bull, which is a gift even more amazing to behold now that Mitchell is wheelchair-bound quadriplegic.
“I think it would surprise people to know that the girl spinning around in a wheelchair, looking at multi-factorial diseases in a lab in a big city, is the same girl who grew up competing in goat-tying, barrel racing, and pole bending,” said Mitchell laughing.
As a teenager, Mitchell rehabbed a retired racehorse and together the duo won five world titles in equine events, the first of many sports world titles that Mitchell would claim.
The Moment That Changed Everything
At age 12, Mitchell started to experience double vision and blurred vision. After waking up paralyzed at the age of 18, the track scholarship student was diagnosed with neuromyletitis optica – more commonly known as Devic’s disease. Overnight, Mitchell saw her dreams come crashing down as the disease left her paralyzed from the neck down and with permanent double vision.
“I lost my track scholarship, and my dreams of becoming an orthopedic surgeon just vanished. That was really hard,” said Mitchell.
Though her athletic scholarship was gone, Mitchell had graduated valedictorian of her high school and was offered an academic scholarship to Oklahoma State University.
It was during an advising session that she chose engineering.
“Being from a small, rural town. I had no idea what engineering was. They suggested it to me because I had tested really high in math and science, so I was like cool, that sounds good. Then I had to choose between electrical, chemical, and mechanical - biomedical wasn’t even an option then - and I picked chemical because I enjoyed chemistry. That’s how I became an engineer,” said Mitchell.
After graduation, Mitchell worked for ExxonMobil in reservoir modeling, but medicine was always calling her name. A few years later, she decided to earn a Ph.D. and applied to three schools with three very different programs.
She eventually chose Georgia Tech and Emory University’s dual Ph.D. program in biomedical engineering, a choice that stemmed from her own personal experience and her new goals.
“Looking back, I can see the writing on the wall that was pointing the doctors to Devic’s disease. But in the middle of all of it, it was so hard to pair different symptoms together. I’m hoping that my work in predictive medicine will make patient care better, leading to quicker, more accurate diagnoses.”
Going for the Gold
While in college, Mitchell was spotted by a coach who took note of her wheelchair agility. He asked if she had ever played wheelchair basketball. Mitchell had played some basketball in high school, but had not yet attempted any sports as a disabled person.
She soon joined Oklahoma State’s team and played for four seasons before the severe progression of her paralysis and vision damage put a stop to her rising basketball career. Still, the time proved crucial to Mitchell both on and off of the court.
“My insurance wouldn’t cover me to go to rehab, so when I left the hospital for the first time I had no idea how to do anything,” said Mitchell.
“All my teammates during this time were amazing. My life had completely changed, but I had zero guidance on how to adapt. It was nice to be surrounded by other people with disabilities who taught me so many tricks and tips.”
She later tried quad rugby, which she dubbed “murderball,” but decided that she needed to play an individual sport. Playing an individual sport would allow Mitchell to simultaneously be an elite Team USA athlete and have a successful research and professional career. Mitchell chose to compete in paracycling and her first love, track and field.
Mitchell set a goal to reach the 2012 Paralympics and quickly started to win titles and set records in her new sports. In 2011, she became the first female quadriplegic Paracycling National and World Champion. Mitchell currently holds seven Para Athletics world records in female quadriplegic track and field events.
In 2012, she made Team USA and made her Paralympic debut in London, competing in the T52 100m & 200m and the F52 discus, placing 4th in each event.
Unsatisfied with her performance, Mitchell trained hard for the 2016 games. Shortly before the trials, Mitchell was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a rare blood cancer. Despite the diagnosis, Mitchell continued to train and made the team again, all while undergoing chemotherapy. In Rio, she took home a silver and a bronze medal in discus and club throw respectively. She has her eyes set on bringing home a gold in 2020.
Achieving the Three C’s
While most labs employ graduate students to assist with research, Mitchell made an unusual choice. Her lab mainly consists of undergraduates – sometimes up to 30 – along with a few graduate students.
“People told me I was crazy and could ruin my career by working with so many undergraduates, but the undergrads have been amazing. We now have a great system, and these students are like family to me.”
The lab focuses on predictive medicine and multi-factorial diseases, covering health issues like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s, obesity, asthma, cancer, and more. By combining machine learning, artificial intelligence, and biostatistics principles, they are able to achieve “the three C’s” – identify causes, develop cures, and optimize care.
“I didn’t want to only do work that helps people 30 years from now. I also want to make people’s lives better right now.”
Because big pharmaceutical companies don’t invest in ALS, Mitchell has spent a significant amount of time dedicated to this disease in particular, allowing her to make a big impact. The lab recently published an article that could change how soon Medicare distributes a certain machine for ALS patients, which could lead to extending their life by more than double.
Another aspect that makes Mitchell’s lab unique is its approach to algorithms. Instead of only developing new algorithms, they also take ones that have been put on a shelf, tune them up, and insert them into the pipeline to solve a biomedical problem.
“We’re more of applied machine learning, where we take pieces of methods, put them together in new ways, and try to solve a big puzzle. It’s challenging because creating a non-biomedical algorithm is hard enough, but add in all of the unpredictable biology and chemistry of the human body, and it gets even more difficult,” said Mitchell.
Always Look for the Good
Moving forward, Mitchell is excited to increase Georgia Tech’s level of accessibility and inclusion. She was selected as a 2019 Georgia Tech Diversity and Inclusion Fellow, and is helping to head up ABLE Alliance, Georgia Tech’s first accessibility organization.
“I think this campus is long overdue for an accessibility overhaul. There haven’t been a ton of resources out there, and I’ve had so many disabled students come through my door looking for help. Given that we are Georgia Tech, we can do so much to help our students be successful in this environment.”
The alliance was started last spring and will pick up steam this coming academic year.
Mitchell also volunteers as a counselor for people who have undergone similar trauma, including patients at the Shepherd Center Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Hospital.
“I believe we have a choice about everything in our lives. Sure, I wouldn’t pick to be in a wheelchair, but I can choose to see the good in it. It’s a daily choice, and sometimes it’s easy and sometimes it’s hard. I try to help other people realize that the most important thing they can do every day is never give up.”
Georgia Tech Launches Online Master's Degree Program in Cybersecurity
The Georgia Institute of Technology has announced a new online cybersecurity master’s degree that will be offered for less than $10,000 and delivered in collaboration with edX. The Online Master of Science in Cybersecurity (OMS Cybersecurity) is designed to address a severe global workforce shortage in the field. According to the 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study, the shortage is expected to reach 1.8 million people by 2022.
Georgia Tech is the only nationally ranked Top 10 university to offer such a program at a tuition rate intended to increase higher education accessibility and affordability. The degree has existed on campus since 2002 and costs $20,000 for in-state students and $40,000 for those out-of-state. Applications for spring 2019 are open now until October 1.
The OMS Cybersecurity program will launch January 7, 2019 with 250 students and will scale over time to meet demand and student needs. The program is designed to serve working professionals who can study part-time and earn the degree within two to three years. It is richly technical and offers the same three interdisciplinary tracks available on campus beginning with information security and followed by policy and energy systems in fall 2019.
“Georgia Tech’s OMS Cybersecurity degree pairs world-class computer science, engineering, and public policy instruction with Georgia Tech Research Institute’s legacy of applied research in areas related to military, government, and law enforcement,” said Rafael L. Bras, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs and K. Harrison Brown Family Chair. "As demand continues to grow, Georgia Tech is proud to deliver innovative, affordable, top quality education in high-demand areas, like cybersecurity, to learners around the nation and world.”
OMS Cybersecurity is Georgia Tech’s third at-scale online degree program. It will follow the same model as the groundbreaking online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program, which launched in 2014 on Udacity with support from AT&T and has enrolled approximately 10,000 students overall for the $6,800 degree. The Institute followed on that success in 2017 by launching the Online Master of Science in Analytics on edX with support from AT&T and Accenture, which currently has 706 students in its second semester and costs less than $10,000.
Stackable, affordable, and accessible
“We are excited to strengthen our partnership with Georgia Tech by now offering two top-ranked online master’s degrees in high-demand fields to learners all over the world,” said Anant Agarwal, edX chief executive officer and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “The new OMS Cybersecurity follows on the success of the stacked OMS Analytics on edX, which offers learners the option to start with a MicroMasters program on edX that can count toward their full master’s degree. This collaboration with Georgia Tech is the latest milestone in creating stackable, affordable, and accessible online master’s degrees in subjects that address today’s global skill gaps.”
OMS Cybersecurity is built on the proven success of the on-campus Master of Science in Cybersecurity, which was started as a master’s degree in information security in 2002 by Mustaque Ahamad, associate director, Institute for Information Security & Privacy, professor, School of Computer Science, and co-founder and chief scientist at Pindrop, a cybersecurity company. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the cybersecurity field, the program was broadened to include tracks in energy systems and policy.
“The on-campus program has a long history as a world-class master’s degree in information security,” said Ahamad. “Graduates from this degree have gone on to become top leaders in the field.”
"Cybersecurity is a global problem,” said Milton Mueller, professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Public Policy, “The OMS format not only extends Georgia Tech's reach to American professionals in cybersecurity but also makes it possible for working professionals anywhere in the world to avail themselves of Tech's educational resources and expertise."
Workforce need, industry observation propel new degree
The U.S. will have 265,000 more cybersecurity jobs than skilled workers by 2022, as projected by the ISC Center for Cyber Safety and Education. Cybersecurity job postings continue to surge, having increased by 71 percent between 2012 and 2017. Job postings specifying a master’s degree have grown by 73 percent during the same period, based on data provided in the 2017 Burning Glass/Labor Insights Report. The report also cites the Washington D.C. metro area as ranking first in the country for cybersecurity employment opportunities with 44,244 job postings.
"As chief information security officers work to protect organizations from malicious cyber threats, they have difficulty finding trained people to staff their team. The cybersecurity workforce pipeline is a critical component to the future of our nation’s economic and national security posture. CISOs are excited to hear about Georgia Tech’s degree providing enhanced training and teaching multi-faceted skills for employment in the cybersecurity job market,” said Patrick Gaul, executive director of the National Technology Security Coalition.
OMS Cybersecurity is an interdisciplinary collaboration between Georgia Tech’s School of Computer Science in the College of Computing, the School of Public Policy in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering.
"The OMS Cybersecurity degree offers the same comprehensive, rigorous curriculum as the on-campus program," said Raheem Beyah, faculty lead for the program, Motorola Foundation Professor and associate chair for Strategic Initiatives and Innovation in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and co-founder of Fortiphyd Logic, Inc., an industrial control cybersecurity company. “Courses are taught by leaders in the field of cybersecurity research who are sought after by industry and government entities for their knowledge and expertise."
Courses for the program will be designed and produced for online delivery by Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE), the Institute’s lifelong learning arm that has provided professional education for more than 40 years.
“OMS Cybersecurity is designed for working professionals aiming to develop deep expertise in cybersecurity without interrupting their careers,” said Nelson Baker, dean of GTPE. “With this degree, we’re able to offer them the opportunity to build careers in a rapidly growing field while delivering cybersecurity experts to industry to address extreme workforce shortages.”

“The ICPC is a global community of universities and volunteers who come together to provide an opportunity for students of computing to develop excellence in problem-solving,” said Deputy ICPC Executive Director Jeff Donahoo, who is also a computer science professor at Baylor University.
“It is only fitting that our first NAC is being hosted by the Georgia Tech College of Computing, an institution known globally for excellence in research and education.”
The 55 regional teams from the United States and Canada competing in the 2020 ICPC NAC – each with three students and a coach – will vie for six challenge medals, rankings, and the chance to be the inaugural ICPC North America Champions.
Students, coaches, and others wanting to keep up with developments or share their experiences can use the hashtag #icpcNAC20 for the event.
The winning team, along with 2019 regional winners, will advance to the 2020 ICPC World Finals in Moscow. Teams winning a wildcard or one of six challenge medals will also move on to the finals, scheduled for June 21-26.
The ICPC is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. The ICPC operates under the auspices of the ICPC Foundation, which was founded to advance the art and sport of competitive programming for the benefit of society. More than 320,000 students have competed in ICPC since it began in 1970. In 2018, nearly 53,000 students from more than 3,200 universities in 110 countries participated in ICPC events.
While You Were Away: GT Computing 2019 Summer Highlights
Whether you were interning, traveling, building Star Wars sand sculptures, or binge-watching Black Mirror, chances are you weren't fully tuned into the College this summer.
Not to worry. We're here to catch you up on all of the big stories you may have missed.
Probably the biggest news this summer, nay, this year is that the College has a new dean. Stepping up from the faculty ranks, Charles Isbell took the helm as the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing on July 1. He is the fourth person to hold this position.
His philosophy as dean is built on the foundation he laid long ago as an undergraduate.
“To me, it’s all about community,” he said. “I want people to feel like they belong, and that the community reflects their experiences. I want people to feel that the things they’re learning apply to their worlds.”

Suitable for Framing: Galil Portrait 'Captures Something Real'
Before we could welcome Dean Isbell, we had to say farewell to Dean Zvi Galil. Galil stepped down as the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing in June following his announcement in 2018.
Galil became GT Computing dean in July 2010. Under his leadership, the College has seen significant enrollment growth at the undergraduate and graduate levels, achievement in interdisciplinary research and thought leadership, goal-breaking fundraising efforts, and the development and continued success of the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program.

Graduate Fellowship Fund Honors CS Alum
The College celebrated the life and memory of Sastry V. Nanduri this summer by establishing a graduate fellowship fund in his name. An alumnus, entrepreneur, and former College advisory board member, Nanduri passed away last year.
He was passionate about solving real-world problems, and a mentor and teacher who sought to share his passions with others.
Interim Chairs to Guide Schools During Search Process
In June, the names of interim chairs were announced for two of the College of Computing’s three schools. Srinivas Aluru began as interim chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) in June, while Mostafa Ammar began earlier this month as interim chair of the School of Computer Science (SCS).

Alumnae Receive Prestigious Awards at CHI 2019
Just as the Spring 2019 semester was wrapping up, two alumnae were recognized by the CHI community in Glasgow, U.K., one for her overall contributions in human-computer interaction at the conference, and another for her long history of promoting social action within the community.
Jennifer Mankoff, one of Professor Gregory Abowd’s first of 30 Ph.D graduates in 2001, was inducted into the prestigious CHI Academy this week, and Gillian Hayes (2007), also advised by Abowd, was awarded the Social Impact award.
Queer in AI Fosters Inclusion in the Research Community
Gender bias is one of the most pressing issues in artificial intelligence (AI) today, but what if even just sorting data by gender is part of the problem? This question is one of many that the group Queer in AI asks.
College of Computing alumnus and Google AI Resident Rapha Gontijo Lopes co-founded the group in 2018 to create a community for queer researchers and to raise awareness of LGBTQIA+ issues in AI and machine learning (ML).
New Approach Cuts Time Needed for Genomic Testing
From disease-causing organisms to mutations caused by cancer, the first step in diagnosing many health concerns often begins with identifying variations in genomes. But, this can take several days with existing technology.
A new algorithm developed at Georgia Tech, however, is shifting this paradigm by dramatically reducing the time it takes to identify genomic variations in a cell or organism to just a few hours or even minutes.
Samira Samadi Researches Theory that Can Help Everyone
When Samira Samadi was in her third year of college, she took a class on the theory of computation where she learned about the Turing machine. The Church-Turing thesis, named after two renowned mathematicians, states that a simple abstract machine can determine any algorithmically solvable problem. The class was life-changing for the Sharif University of Technology mathematics student.
“It was super cool that such a simple structure can describe any algorithm or computation that a computer or a human could do,” she said. “It was a window for me that what I study could go far beyond the abstract. I could do great things with it.”

Frogger Used to Demo Breakthrough Explainable AI
Why did the frog cross the road? Well, a new artificial intelligent (AI) agent that can play the classic arcade game Frogger not only can tell you why it crossed the road, but it can justify its moves in everyday language.
Developed by Georgia Tech, in collaboration with Cornell and the University of Kentucky, the work enables an AI agent to provide a rationale for a mistake or errant behavior, and to explain it in a way that is easy for non-experts to understand.
“If the power of AI is to be democratized, it needs to be accessible to anyone regardless of their technical abilities,” said Upol Ehsan, Ph.D. student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech and lead researcher.

CS Majors Helping Automate a Safe Return to In-person Work and School
A new automated tool that uses the latest Covid-19 health and safety research is on track to help organizations plan and implement a safe return to in-person work and school amid the pandemic.
Called Rotations, the web-based platform was selected on Jan. 28 as the winning concept for Hack Covid-19, a student hackathon organized by Emory Global Health Institute and Georgia Tech. The winning team includes two Georgia Tech computer science (CS) majors.
Rotations is an automated schedule generator that helps mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in shared workspaces. According to its developers, the tool uses current health and safety data to auto-generate schedules, as well as suggested seating layouts, optimized to keep returning in-person employees and students safe.
“We put ourselves in the place of an office manager or school administrator and asked, ‘What kind of tool could make returning to in-person functions as easy as possible and how could we minimize the spread of the virus as much as possible at the same time?’” said Arvin Poddar, Rotations team member and third-year Georgia Tech CS major.
The schedules and seating charts output by the platform are customizable based on variables unique to a particular workspace. These can include a maximum number of people, square footage of a room, ventilation, and other factors. These data points are also used to calculate a safety score that integrates available research resources.
“We are trying to change the game by looking at the research and seeing how floor layouts can truly be optimized with data,” said Merissa Coleman, team member and a third-year human health major from Emory University.
Another feature that helps mitigate the spread of the virus is the platform’s ability to automatically stagger arrival times for in-person employees. This helps to minimize contact and ensure proper social distancing. If someone does report contracting Covid-19, the platform has a contact tracing function that will automatically alert all of those that were in recent contact with that person.
“We wanted the product to be applicable to both management and employees. So, along with being easy to use, we wanted to be able to give peace of mind to those returning to the office and the classroom,” said Coleman.
As the winners of the Hack Covid-19 competition, Coleman, Poddar, and teammate Ryan Cobelli – also a Georgia Tech CS major – receive a $3,500 cash prize and earn a spot in the CREATE-X Startup Launch program this summer. CREATE-X is Georgia Tech’s entrepreneurial accelerator for students that helps develop projects like Rotations into business startups.
“As we know, Covid is changing every day and the situation is evolving. So, we are really looking forward to developing this product into something that people can really use,” said Poddar.
A primary feature that the team would like to develop while participating in the Startup Launch program is direct integration of the Rotations tool. Being able to directly connect with systems that schools and businesses already use will do away with the current need for administrators to manually upload .csv files to develop rosters.
Beyond this, Poddar sees potential for even more integration with existing systems.
“Ultimately, maybe Rotations doesn’t even need to be its own stand-alone platform. Maybe it could be directly integrated into an existing HR system or learning management platform,” said Poddar.

From the Dean's Desk - Aug. 18, 2020
Dear GT Computing community,
I am pleased to note that Vivek Sarkar has officially taken over as the chair of the School of Computer Science as of this week. With Haesun Park in place as chair of Computational Science and Engineering as of last week, we now have our full slate of school leadership in place. Also, not for nothing, but I am very pleased to note that out of our four schools and divisions, three are now headed by women. The College is modeling what it means to create excellence by bringing together a diverse group of leaders, something we know we need across our entire field.
I would like once again to thank Srinivas Aluru and Mostafa Ammar for serving as interim chairs for CSE and SCS for the past year. I would say that we will miss their leadership, but we have nothing to worry about there. Srinivas will continue in his role as Executive Director of IDEAS, and Mostafa is sticking around to help the College launch our new School for Cybersecurity and Privacy. He will be working with Mustaque Ahamad and Wenke Lee, as well as other faculty across the Institute, to help build SCP in preparation for the day it fully opens its doors.
On a more prosaic note, I want to remind everyone who comes into campus to pick up their Institute-provided PPE, namely two masks and a personal refillable bottle of hand sanitizer. The locations for each building are as follows:
- Coda: Floor 12E, Coda Support Services Team. Please call (404) 374-7378 and wait outside the of the CSS glass doors for service.
- CCB: CCB Mailroom 033
- Klaus: CCB Mailroom 033
- TSRB: Cori Wilson, Room 211
There have been some other changes to our operations now that we have students back on campus; please consult our business continuity webpage for updates on building access, deliveries, facilities and mail.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - Aug. 3, 2021
There are so many things going on as we prepare to work our way back to campus.
First off, let me thank all the folks crafting return-to-campus plans. We seem to be converging on a reasonable starting place, and that’s happening because of everyone working together thoughtfully.
Speaking of back to campus, you may have seen a note from President Cabrera in your e-mail inbox recently. He has asked that everyone consider wearing a mask while on campus. Please note that this is not a mask mandate: because GT is a state entity, the belief is that we are not subject to the City of Atlanta’s mask mandate. I’m not sure where this is all going to end up, but the conversations are ongoing. In the meantime, I would like to echo the President and encourage you to be thoughtful about wearing a mask. Stay informed and aware as facts are changing on the ground day by day.
Oh! I know I sent a dispatch about the new NSF AI institutes last week, but for more context, I encourage you to read President Cabrera’s message to alumni about AI at Georgia Tech. There’s a bit of CoC history (I’m looking at you Ron) and a description of the bright future ahead.
In other good news, our own Srinivas Aluru has been named editor-in-chief of the journal IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. His appointment will start on August 1 and run through December 2024. Please join me in congratulating Srinivas for his intellectual leadership.
Finally, I’d like to mention Highcharts Sonification Studio, Bruce Walker’s (IC) new open-source tool for the sonification of charts. This research makes it possible to listen to data as well as look at it, which, um, sounds amazing. It is clearly beneficial to everyone and a real boon to those with visual impairments.
So there you go. There’s a week and a semester ahead of us. Take some time to stomp your feet, shake your groove thing, or, you know what?, do the conga. Or do what I’m going to try to do sometime this century and just rest. I shall see you before too long.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - July 13, 2021
Dear GT Computing community,
It’s July, and that means it’s beginning to feel like summer. It’s July 2021, and that means we’re coming up on the long-awaited return to campus. I’d like to take a moment to talk a little bit about how that will likely look. Of course, the details will vary from group to group and person to person, but we can see the outline for the rest of the year.
First, there’s the timing. Classes begin for the Fall semester on Monday, August 23. This is the key date around which most of our plans must revolve. In particular, the students will be fully back on campus studenting. As such, all of us across the entire campus have to plan to engage fully with them by then. Some of us will have to engage even before then in order to prepare for their arrival. Actually, many of us are on campus now (quite literally today) managing our once-again-in-person FASET meetings with parents and new students.
Second, I think we all know work will look a little different this Fall and it will continue to evolve over the rest of the year. Just as with timing, how we return to campus will likely look different for different groups. I am empowering different offices and supervisors across the College to create plans for their teams consistent with what we know is allowed by GT and USG rules. Our goal is to be at least as—and even more—flexible than we were pre-COVID on the one hand but to also make sure that our plans for each team across the College allows us to serve our constituents even more effectively and efficiently. Online and virtual services are wonderful, but they absolutely mean that more, not fewer, will take advantage of these services. We need each group to think deeply about what you do and how best to be effective in this new environment.
Finally, I’d like to reiterate the Institute’s rules around masking and social distancing. Outside of labs, no one can require another person to wear a mask. You may not put up signs asking visitors to your offices or spaces to wear masks. Now, it may be within your good judgment to wear a mask yourself, and if so I encourage you to do so. But we must follow Institute rules on this matter.
And there we go. We have a little bit of thought and effort ahead of us, but I believe that if we work together we’ll end up in a better place for everyone in the GT family eventually.
Oh, before I let you go, I would like to share that one of our graduates, Andrea Fletcher (BS CS ’16), has been profiled in the Wall Street Journal, talking about her dream career working for Roblox. As we all work through our worries about going back to work, let us remember that we are making dreams come true. It’s worth it.
So keep that difference you make in the lives of so many in mind for the next month or year or decade or so. And for now, enjoy the weather, get out and play, see your friends and family. Be safe. I’ll see you soon.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - July 20, 2021
Dear GT Computing community,
I’ve got some good news today. Georgia Tech has just been rated #5 globally for computer science research by Guide2Research.com.
Now, there are a lot of rankings out there, but this one is particularly interesting because it’s based on our collective h-index. For those who don’t know, the h-index is a measurement that tracks how much a researcher publishes and (importantly) how many other researchers are citing their work. It is a kind of shorthand for our intellectual influence.
As we all know, rankings are useless, except the ones I like, and I like this one because it shows that the research we do here is influential.
In other good news, the College of Computing has three alumni on this year's 40 under 40 list:
- Mahdi Al-Husseini (MS CS '20), an aeromedical evacuations officer for the U.S. Army who also develops technology and policy for aviation safety.
- Vanessa Larco (BS CS '08), venture capitalist and founding member of LatinXVC, a group to help Latinos enter venture capitalism.
- Dhawal Shah (MS CS '10), CEO of Class Central, a website that has matched more than 40 million users to online education programs.
Finally, I’m starting to hear from teams across the College who are formulating their work plans for fall. Please continue working with your supervisors as they fill out the details.
So there you go. Have a good week. Find some time to take it easy. Take a moment and go for a drive, spend time with your friends and your family. I’ll see you back here next week. I have to go catch a plane.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - July 27, 2021
Dear GT Computing community,
It’s the last day of summer classes, and we are all turning our attention to the fall semester, and to our return to campus.
I’m sure everyone is working with their supervisors to hammer out their work arrangements for the fall. As is always the case, different groups have different needs and different responsibilities, so plans may be a little different from one group to another; however, I do expect some strong commonalities:
- Fall classes start on August 23, so plan to “start” next month, probably close to August 16 for most of us.
- In the Before Times(tm) we were allowed one work-from-home day a week as a default, and I expect most of us will be able to see that rise to two as a default. For some, that increase will not work out (just as one day a week did not for every group). Some will be able to make an extraordinarily good case showing that more remote work will improve productivity.
- Things happen, so I expect each team to have on-campus coverage every day.
No matter where we end up, these plans must reflect what’s best for each group and will require that as groups we will work together to make the right thing happen. Speaking of where we end up, this is just the first step. I very much expect that both CoC and the Institute will be able to revisit these plans before the end of the year as we figure out what works, and put in the infrastructure to help us to work better, remotely or otherwise.
I know the return to campus can be a source of uncertainty and irritation, but we’ll figure it out. More importantly, it’s not all uncertainty and irritation. I suspect many of you are very happy at the thought that we will be together again. I know I am. In fact, we are planning a year of celebration with events, T-shirts and more. Our theme is the Power of Two, capturing what we can accomplish when we come together to pursue our common goals. We have shown that power through the last year, pulling together through crisis after crisis, and I want to celebrate how that energy will carry us to new heights moving forward. More on the nerdy future events later.
In the meantime, let me end by noting that our own Andrea Grimes Parker (SIC) is co-PI on a $2.4 million grant to develop a virtual health counselor called Clara. Clara is designed to address vaccine hesitancy and will be piloted in 12 Black churches in Boston. Please join me in thanking Andrea for her intellectual leadership, and for her work using technology for the public good.
That’s all for today. Have a good week, and make sure you take some time to relax. Head out to the country, or into the city, or just stay home and relax. I shall see you here next week.
Peace.

Sonia Chernova (SIC) is the PI and Beth Mynatt is the co-PI of the NSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups (AI-CARING). The AI-CARING institute aims to develop new longitudinal, collaborative AI systems that work with aging adults, including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and their caregivers.
Both of these Institutes build on decades of our research, and both will not only create novel technologies but also train a new generation of researchers. Here in the College of Computing, we strive to build new technologies that improve the human condition, and these Institutes embody that ethos to a T (stolen by the students or otherwise).
Please join me in congratulating Sonia, Beth and Ashok for their intellectual leadership. Congratulations also to Pascal Van Hentenryck of ISyE, who is the PI for the NSF AI Institute for Advances in Optimization (AI4Opt).
These grants, $60 million in total, rest on literal decades of work on AI, aging, and education in the College. They are also at the leading edge of a new wave of investment in AI at Georgia Tech. We are expected to hire 100 new AI researchers in the field over the next few years. CoC is also investing not only in faculty but in graduate fellowships and in new courses teaching AI as a tool for science and engineering.
I couldn’t be more proud of our achievements in AI, and I can’t wait to see what this expansion allows us to do next. We’ve got a lot to celebrate, so enjoy the good times and I will see you back here next week.
Peace.

Dear GT Computing community,
It’s a beautiful day here in Atlanta, and the birds are out singing to celebrate a new fiscal year and the great renewal that comes with it. I’m going to join our avian colleagues and talk today about some changes we are making in the College in order to build on our past successes and set us up for the future. In short, we are expanding and restructuring our Office of Outreach, Enrollment, and Community.
As you know, one of the key strengths of the College is its community. Our community is broad: it includes students, faculty, staff, and alumni, but also those who are joining the field of computing through our outreach efforts. For more than a decade, OEC has spearheaded and supported many of these community efforts. Sometimes quite visibly, sometimes quietly, but always with energy and passion.
OEC has grown dramatically just as our community has grown, and just as the importance of computing has grown. To manage this growth and to increase our impact, we are strengthening all parts of OEC:
- Our corporate and alumni support operations will join the Office of Development. We have partnered with the GT Alumni Association to focus on our young alumni especially and to formalize the pilot programs we have started in the last two years.
- Many of our various internal community, wellness, and enrichment programs will come together in an organization that will report up through Irfan Essa, our Senior Associate Dean.
- Similarly, our many outreach programs in OEC and Constellations will also come together. This restructuring will consolidate the logistical and organizational support that touches so many of our efforts across the College. One important consequence is that the event coordinators from OEC and Communications will come together into a college-level event management group.
All in all, these developments are good for the College and the amazing folks who have worked on these efforts. They will set up for our next wave of growth (I say next but it’s already here) and support our strategic goals, including our focus on increasing the diversity of and access to the field of computing at every stage in the pipeline. The new outreach group will strengthen and add to our existing programs for diversifying the field, which is good for us and for the larger community.
While we’re on the subject of renewal, I have another somewhat mixed announcement to make: Brad Hastings, our exceptional Senior Director of Development, has agreed to serve as the Executive Director of Development for the College of Engineering going forward. That’s good news for CoE but, well, let’s just say I have a few other feelings as well. Having said that, Brad has graciously agreed to continue in his role with CoC for the foreseeable future while we transition to the upcoming campaign.
So there you go. Please enjoy the week ahead. Take some time to sing a song, to dance like no one’s watching (because as I cannot emphasize enough no one is), or just to enjoy the morning sun. I’ll see you again soon, maybe even in person.
Peace.

From the Dean's Desk - June 1, 2020
I’ve thought a lot about it since, but at the time all I could think was: “That’s a really big gun.”
I was at a capital-T Traffic Stop somewhere outside of Cambridge, MA. A police officer was approaching me on the driver’s side and for some reason he went for his gun and yelled at me to be still. I got… stiller… and eventually it was all over and I drove away.
Only later, while trying to calm down my friends did I think, “He could have killed me”.
I’m not sure exactly when that changed to “…and he would have gotten away with it”. I think it was April 29, 1992. That was a day much like the days we’re experiencing now.
In the many years since, my thoughts have returned to that night. They became “…and would anyone have heard about it?” They became, “…and if they did what would they have heard?” Would the reports say I led a high speed chase? Would the pundits say that if only I’d complied, I’d be alive? What would they have dredged up? Maybe somehow that time in seventh grade when I checked out Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret from the library would be held against me.
I don’t know, but it would have been something, and it would be like dying twice.
It’s not always the Traffic Stop. Sometimes I think about the time that guy in the pick up truck spit on me, or the confrontation with the police while I was house hunting. A few weeks ago, I was sitting on a curb in my embarrassingly sprawling neighborhood and someone in a truck drove by, stopped maybe 40 yards away, backed up and stared at me for five or six seconds, then left. “What was that about? What could it have been about?”
My son is 12, all arms and legs. Studies tell me that when he walks down the street, he’ll be more likely mistaken for 16. His 12-year old movements will be threatening. I know: I’ve already had that conversation with teachers.
Yesterday, I sat in my car with him and we talked about what’s going on, and this is neither the first nor second such conversation. He doesn’t quite believe what’s happening, but he believes it more every time we have this conversation. I know he’ll believe it more the next time we are here, the next time someone utters a racial epithet around him. This is a reality I went through, and I know it’s a reality he’ll go through.
My thoughts nowadays are more about him. He’s one candy bar away from “Gun!” and being shot. He’s a moment away from “He should have complied” and “He was no saint” and whatever else they would say. It wouldn’t be true, not this boy who interrupts my meetings to hug me and ask me if he can have apple juice, but I know it would be said.
Of course, I think about other things. In so many ways, my life is great… and I have a lot to do, so I go back to the business of getting through my life and resigning myself to the fact that I really do have to do my taxes this weekend. But the thoughts always come back.
You know what I’m thinking now? As I write this, I’m sitting in my office and I’m looking out at my city. I can see the campus, I can see midtown and downtown, buildings poking out above all the many trees. But I don’t see smoke. I don’t see broken windows. I don’t see all the stories out there. I know that right over there two college kids from Spelman and Morehouse were dragged from their car and tased during the demonstrations this weekend, and I’m sure there are other stories, and some of them probably ended even worse. I know most of them were never recorded, never noted by the public.
I don’t see your story either, but I know you have one. We all do. That’s mostly what I think about at times like these. Everyone has a story. I may not see yours any more than you see mine, but I know you have one.
In the end it’s what binds us together. We all have stories and as often as not they are similar in some important way. It’s how we know we are human together.
And when they are different? Well that’s even more important. Those differences also tell us about each other, even when they are so different that they seem hard to imagine.
Either way, these stories make us the community we are. It is, simply, fundamentally true. And when we realize it, we can change things. It really doesn’t have to be the way it’s always been. We can make it better as a community. In fact, we must.
Look, it’s been a long few weeks, and a very long weekend. Please, stay safe. I’d like to hear you tell your story one day.
Peace.

Students who wish to pursue a Master's degree in Bioengineering may do so through the College of Computing. The specific requirements differ from those of the computer science master's program, and while the degree is granted from the College, applications for this program are processed through Georgia Tech's Bioengineering Center in the Office of Interdisciplinary Programs.
Visit the MS Bioengineering degree website for program details.
Master of Science in Computational Science & Engineering - Distance Learning
The CSE master's degree program includes an option to take most courses through Georgia Tech Professional Education. Students do not need to physically reside on the Atlanta campus while taking coursework through Professional Education.
Students must register as an "online student" in semesters when taking one or more courses, and all courses taken during those semesters should be courses through Professional Education. In other words, one cannot take some courses on campus and others through Professional Education during the same semester.
Students should carefully evaluate the course offerings provided through Georgia Tech Professional Education before applying as an online student. While most courses with a CSE course designation are offered through Professional Education, many specialization courses are only offered on campus.
The CSE program handbook includes information concerning specific specialization courses that have been offered through Professional Education in the past (see the appendices in the handbook listing specialization courses). Prospective students may wish to consult with a CSE program advisor to determine if a specific set of courses may be used to fulfill M.S. CSE degree requirements.
Master of Science in Computer Science
Graduates receive the MSCS for completing one of three options in the program as described in the program of study. The program is designed for students who possess a bachelor's degree in computer science from an accredited institution. Students with a bachelor's degree in other than computer science are encouraged to apply as well, with the understanding that they may be required to complete remedial course work in addition to the requirements of the M.S. CS degree.
Admissions
Admission to the program is highly selective; there are many more qualified applicants than there are places in the program. The challenge for the College every year is to select a class from a highly qualified pool. The College looks for compelling reasons to admit candidates, and the statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, test scores and GPA are all reviewed carefully. Having a strong undergraduate background in computer science, including C programming, is highly recommended for applicants. The Admissions Committee welcomes additional pertinent information that will aid in making objective and informed decisions.
Students are admitted to the master's program only once a year. The application deadline is Feb. 1 for admission to the following fall semester.
Learn important information about our admissions process on our Admissions Requirements page.

Program of Study
The degree requires 36 credit hours, which are taken over four semesters. All students take the same core courses, a set of courses related to their chosen specialization (Computing, Digital Media in LMC, Industrial Design, Psychology), a broader set of electives and complete a master’s project. Students complete an internship in the summer after their first year of study.
Elective courses can be in a wide variety of areas, such as Architecture, Music Technology, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Computer Science, Human-Robot Interaction, Human Factors, Management of Technology and Cognitive Science. Students can earn the Management of Technology Certificate from the College of Management.
More than 50 faculty work in these and closely-related areas, and are associated with research labs and centers such as the GVU Center, the Institute for People and Technology, the Aware Home, the Interactive Media Technology Center, the Sonification Lab, GTRI and many more.

This 36 credit-hour, cohort-based program is a professional Master of Science in Robotics over four semesters designed to produce industry-ready engineers and scientists with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills needed to meet the challenges of rapidly growing interdisciplinary technologies in professional careers related to designing and developing robotics and automation solutions. Such a program is in high demand by not only students but also a growing list of local and global companies interested in robotics and factory automation.
The MS Robotics program provides its graduates with a practitioner-oriented degree that clearly distinguishes them as trained professionals in the field. Its curriculum is specifically tailored to the educational needs for robotics professionals by requiring courses in multiple core areas of Robotics (e.g., AI and Mechanics). In addition to coursework, the students will spend a summer performing internship at one of our industrial robotics partners, and complete a capstone project providing them with practical experience directly applicable to their careers.
How to Apply
The MS-Robotics program is offered collaboratively by six schools in the Colleges of Computing, Engineering and Sciences:
- Electrical & Computer Engineering
- Mechanical Engineering
- Aerospace Engineering
- Biomedical Engineering
- Interactive Computing
- Physics
Students can apply to the MS-Robotics program through any of the six participating schools, the choice of which usually reflects that student's intended area of specialization and general background. Students with diverse and eclectic backgrounds are encouraged to apply, including those with previous work or research experience. Each school has its own set of admission criteria but the program generally requires a minimum GPA of 3.3.
Program of Study
The program requires 36 hours of letter-grade coursework with a minimum GPA of 3.0. A maximum of two classes (6 semester hours) at the 4000 level (undergraduate) may be used as free electives toward the required 36 credit hours.

M.S. Computational Science and Engineering
Georgia Tech’s interdisciplinary Master of Science degree in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) is devoted to the creation, study, and application of computer-based models of natural and engineered systems. M.S. CSE graduates are exceptionally prepared for careers in industry, government, and academia.
The program is offered with the option to take portions, or in some instances, all of the coursework off-campus via Georgia Tech Professional Education.
The curriculum has been structured to impart students with solid CSE foundational knowledge and skills. It includes technical specialization courses that enhance a student's domain expertise. Advanced elective courses will enable students to specialize in a domain and technical expertise focusing on their particular interests. The optional thesis portion of the program requires the completion of an interdisciplinary research project.
Admissions Requirements
Interested in applying for the M.S. CSE program? Submit an application through Georgia Tech admissions and be sure to designate a home unit.
Keep in mind:
- Most students entering the CSE graduate degree programs will have obtained a bachelor's degree in a technical field, e.g., computer science, mathematics, or a science or engineering discipline.
- Students should have taken undergraduate calculus courses. Some CSE courses will require additional coursework in topics such as linear algebra or differential equations.
- Working knowledge of probability and statistics will also be helpful in some core courses and specializations.
- Students should have taken at least one course, but preferably two, and have developed a proficiency in programming in a high-level language such as C, FORTRAN or Java.
- Students deficient in one or more of these areas may still gain admission but should expect to take some additional coursework.

Program of Study
If you are interested in applying into the Ph.D. in CSE program, the program of study information will inform you of the hours and course-load required to complete the program.
CSE Qualifying Examination
This examination is designed to ensure the student has achieved sufficient knowledge in core areas of computational science and engineering as well as in their chosen specialization area as preparation for advanced research.
- Written qualifying exam: This written exam encompasses core areas of Computational Science and Engineering. Students select two areas among numerical methods, discrete algorithms, modeling and simulation, computational data analysis, and high performance computing. Material covered by the examination will normally include topics covered in core courses in the core area augmented with a reading list provided to the student as preparation for the examination. The format is a day-long written examination.
- Specialization exam and artifact defense: This portion of the exam has two purposes: to ensure that the student has acquired sufficient knowledge in his/her specialization area in a computing, engineering or science discipline for advanced research, and to ensure that the student can demonstrate an ability to integrate knowledge in mathematical foundations/computational methods and knowledge in a specific engineering or science discipline to synthesize a concrete computational artifact, e.g., a significant computer program. Specifics concerning the specialization exam and artifact defense depend on the home unit.
The qualifying exam must be attempted by the end of the second year of enrollment in the CSE doctoral program and in some home units the exam must be passed by the end of the second year. Please refer to the CSE graduate student handbook for detailed information.
CSE Doctoral Dissertation
The doctoral dissertation (thesis) forms a central component of the CSE Ph.D. program. Students must demonstrate the ability to perform independent research in collaboration with a faculty advisor that can be defended to a committee of faculty. To complete the doctoral thesis, students must complete three principal milestones: the Ph.D. proposal defense, the Ph.D. dissertation, and the Ph.D. dissertation defense.
Ph.D. in Computer Science
All students in the program receive the same degree regardless of their interest area, specialization, research focus or school affiliation. New students are affiliated with the school in which their advisor resides, but none of the schools impose any special requirements compared to another.
As a research-oriented degree, the Ph.D. in Computer Science prepares exceptional students for careers at the cutting edge of academia, industry and government. Students are expected to demonstrate excellence in both defining and executing a substantial research project that forms a novel contribution to the state of the art in computing. With a highly individualized program of study, the degree provides students with depth in their chosen research area coupled with a rigorous breadth of knowledge across the discipline.
First granting the doctoral degree in 1969 (as a Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science), the College of Computing represents a continuation of one of the earliest and most well-established graduate Computing institutions in the United States, and in the world. This stature is reflected in our national and international rankings and, most importantly, in the quality of the students who have graduated from our program.
The CS Ph.D. Structure
The coursework component of the Computer Science Ph.D. consists of an introductory course on graduate studies (CS 7001), along with the separate breadth and minor requirements.
The breadth requirement is intended to give students a broad competency across the discipline of computing through coursework in a range of the College's different research areas. This requirement is satisfied by taking five classes from across the College's different research areas and must include a Programming Proficiency course and a Theory course.
The minor is a 9-hour sequence of courses from outside the College that constitutes a coherent program of study and is determined by the student and advisor. The minor builds non-Computing expertise in an area related to the student's core research area.
As students progress, they must select a primary area of research and pass a qualifier (comprehensive exam) in that area to demonstrate mastery of the field in their chosen area, and readiness to do research.
While coursework plays an important role in the Ph.D., by far the most important component of the degree is the student's individual dissertation research project. This project should contribute to new knowledge in the field of computing, and should demonstrate the student's proficiency in defining and executing a compelling research agenda.
The dissertation research plan is formalized in a written proposal followed by an oral presentation. When a student passes his or her proposal, the student is admitted to candidacy and proceeds with the dissertation research, which is completed with the successful defense and submission of the approved doctoral dissertation.

Offer Acceptances & Student Guidelines
Career Services provides programs and services to support students with their individual professional pursuits. As a member of the College of Computing community, it is important to understand and abide by the Student Rights & Responsibilities defined by the Career Services program. We also ask that you engage in behavior that reflects a common set of values: scholarship, honesty, civility, accountability, caring, discovery, and celebration.
All currently enrolled College of Computing undergraduate, graduate students, and alumni (less than one year) are eligible to participate in campus recruiting, in-person & virtually.
-
GT Offer Guidelines - Communicate your acceptance or refusal of a job offer to employers as promptly as possible, so they can notify other candidates that they are still being considered or that the position is filled. If you need an extension, please request one from an employer. The Institute and the College of Computing use the same guidelines for offers extended to students for internships, co-ops, and full-time positions. Visit the GT Career Center to see the guidelines each semester.
-
Reneging on Offers - If you have accepted an offer and the employer has confirmed their offer, you should cease all job search activities. Reneging a job offer is a serious issue and should never be done lightly. The College of Computing has built relationships with our employers, and the actions of one student can affect that employer’s relationship with all other students. Most importantly, reneging always has a negative impact on peers who also applied to the same positions. It is ethically appropriate that if you have accepted an offer and the employer has confirmed your acceptance, you should cease all job search activities. Students who renege on an offer of employment will be subject to disciplinary action including loss of CoC Career Services opportunities including access to jobs board, CoC Career advising and workshops, and the College of Computing Career Fairs. Additional consequences may also be applied by the GT Career Center. Read the Student Interview Policy.
-
Misrepresentation - Misrepresentation of any information provided to an employer may result in immediate suspension of Career Center services and may result in reporting to the Office of Student Integrity.

Policies regarding GTAs and TAs
This policy document is intended for two groups: 1) faculty requesting GTA support for their courses, 2) PhD students admitted Fall 2011 and later whose degree requirement thus serving twice as a GTA.
For more information on demographics, admissions, and time-to-degree in our doctoral students in our programs, go to the Doctoral Program Statistics page in the Institute's public data portal, LITE. Use the search functions to find your program.
For information on travel funding, please visit our Graduate Student Council and Graduate Program Office Travel funds page.
Basic policy for faculty
One GTA or grader per 25 students, when needed to provide a superior educational experience for students and to leverage faculty time.
Basic policy for PhD students
You are expected to complete one GTA by the end of your third year of study, and the second by the end of your fifth year.
Stipend Levels
Students who receive stipends will be paid at the following rates:
- MS Students (33% FTE) - $1050 per month, 4.5 months per semester.
- Pre-Qualifications Ph.D. Students (45% FTE) - $2475 per month, 4.5 months per semester
- Post-Qualifications Ph.D. Students (50% FTE) - $2750 per month, 4.5 months per semester.
Additional information about Graduate Assistantships, fellowships, loans and off-campus employment options is available on the Office of Graduate Studies site.
Concerning PhD GTAs
PhD students covered by the GTA requirement are expected to complete one GTA by the end of the third year and the second by the end of the fifth year. (Applies to PhD students entering in August 2011 or later).
If a PhD student at the start of their third year, in consultation with their advisor, does not have a plan to GTA in the third year, they may be assigned to GTA a course for which they are qualified and that does not have a PhD GTA. This applies also to the fifth year.
Serving as a GTA satisfies the 2-semester requirement only if course enrollment is at least 25, unless prior approval has been given by the faculty member overseeing GTA assignments. See the FAQs for further restrictions on what courses can count toward the requirement.
Students doing a GTA for the first time must simultaneously take and pass GTA Preparation - CETL 8000 - COC; for the second time, Special Topics - CETL 8801 - COC. Exemptions from taking these two TA classes will be granted only in exceptional circumstances (such as someone with many years of full time teaching experience), and are at the discretion of the PhD coordinator. Exemptions are not granted from the TA requirement, and only teaching or TAing for IC during the two-term academic year fulfills the requirement.
PhD GTAs are preferably used to support graduate rather than undergraduate courses.
Generally only one PhD GTA per course. Additional support is generally provided by MS or BS students.
PhD GRA students are paid to GTA with the expectation of either 18 or 20 hours of work each week (18 hours pre-quals, 20 hours post-quals, including exam week) - which is thus the maximum number of hours that a PhD student fulfilling a GTA requirement can be expected to work in their GTA role.
PhD students admitted prior to 2011 (when the two GTA requirement took effect) who have not opted into the requirement by serving as a GTA twice while being paid as a GRA will only in exceptional circumstances be hired by IC as a GTA. They will be paid at the 37.5% level, and are expected to work no more than 15 hours per week, including exam week.
Concerning MS GTAs
MS GTAs are employed as an MS I, with a stipend per month for 4 months, plus tuition waiver. The stipend rates are reviewed and adjusted by the school each year. The student is responsible for fees and any tuition supplement, such as for the MS-HCI degree. They are expected to work no more than 15 hours per week during the semester, including exam week.
Concerning BS (undergrad) Graders
BS graders are paid on a sliding scale of $7.75 an hour plus $0.65 more for each previous course TA’d, for up to 15 hours per week. The course instructor signs a biweekly time sheet recording actual hours worked.
BS Graders are hired via email to Monica Sweat, sweat@cc.gatech.edu.
Concerning Conflicts of Interest in Grading
It is important that TA’s and graders work together with the course instructor to avoid conflicts of interest during grading. A grader or TA has a conflict of interest in grading any family member, close friend, boyfriend, girlfriend, or small-group partner on projects in other classes. This is not an exhaustive list of possible conflicts of interest. When in doubt, it is best to avoid the perceived conflict. In the case where there are two or more TA’s or graders for a course, they should re-balance who grades which student. If there is just one TA or grader for the course, it is the responsibility of the course instructor to grade those students for which there is a conflict of interest. These guidelines apply to all TA’s and graders, whether they are undergraduates, MS students or PhD students. It is the responsibility of all those involved in teaching and grading to explicitly discuss potential conflicts.
Note to Faculty
The best way for you to ensure high-quality GTA/TA help is to directly recruit students. Undergrad courses are often staffed with undergrads that previously earned A’s in the course or MS students who earned A’s in the graduate version of the course or took a comparable course at their undergraduate school.
Be careful about making final commitments if there is uncertainty about the course enrollment! Enrollment refers to enrollment after DROP/ADD is over, Friday of the first week of classes. Remember that enrollment often drops during the first week - students often register for more classes than they plan to take, or may drop your course if the wait list for another course clears.
Olufisayo Omojokun has a sign-up mechanism for undergrad students interested in TAing specific undergrad courses. If you use undergrad TAs and want help from Fisayo in finding TAs, you should let him know at least one month before the end of the previous semester.
When you speak with potential undergrad graders, emphasize that they will not always be called upon to work the maximum number of hours per week, so they should not expect to earn the maximum amount each week. You should not automatically approve 15 hours each week.
If your enrollment is close to a break-point for an additional GTA or grader, it may be possible to have a grader for a number of hours for the entire semester that is less than the maximum. Talk with the faculty member overseeing GTA assignments.
Elaboration in the Form of FAQS
Q: If a student has been supported by IC for two (or more) semesters (and hence has been a GTA for those semesters) and then moves into a GRA position, does the student now need to do two additional GTAs?
A: No. The degree requirement is to GTA twice. Period. The degree requirement does not say that you have to GTA twice while being a GRA.
Q: If student has already done two GTAs and is now being supported by IC because the advisor has run out of funds, is student expected to GTA?
A: Yes
Q: What if the advisor’s funding for a student runs out after 2 or 3 years, so the student has 2 or more years to go. The advisor may have funding in a new area in which the student is not interested. What happens?
A: This is the joint responsibility of both the advisor and student. The student may have to GRA on the advisor’s new project while completing their dissertation, rather than being a GTA supported by IC.
Q: Must the classes for which a student GTAs be taught by an IC faculty member during the academic year?
A: Yes, effective fall semester 2014. The class must be in IC, because it is IC that is providing the back-up funding for the student. In this context, think of GTAing an IC course as paying the insurance policy premium to guarantee student funding if the advisor cannot support the student. Thus, if your advisor has a fractional appointment in IC and does not teach IC courses with an enrollment of 25 or more, you will need to GTA courses not taught by your advisor. Summer school GTAing does not count for a similar reason, because IC is not financially involved in summer school payment of faculty or GTAs. MOOM GTAing does not count for the same reason.
Q: May a student GTA for two courses during the same semester?
A: No, effective fall semester 2014. The time demands of managing two courses, each with 25 or more students, places an unreasonable burden on the GTA, and can be unfair to students in the two classes by spreading the GTA out “too thin”.
Q: If student is not supported as a GRA and has to GTA, what is the stipend?
A: Same as it would be otherwise. 45% prior to passing quals, 50% after that. For students admitted prior to the 2011 start of the two GTA requirement who have NOT opted into the requirement, 37.5%
Q: During what years is it recommended to GTA?
A: As per the School of IC’s “Doctoral Academic Policies and Procedures” – a document approved by the faculty – the first should be completed no later than during the third year, and the second no later than the fifth year. If there are difficulties in so doing, then the advisor should have a prior discussion with the faculty member having oversight of GTA assignments.
Q: If a student successfully defends and is about to graduate but has not done the two GTAs, what happens?
A: Doing two GTAs is a degree requirement, so the student cannot graduate without having met this requirement.
Q: Student has NSF or other fellowship. Must student do the two GTAs?
A: Yes. Doing two GTAs is a degree requirement, so the student cannot graduate without having met this requirement.
Q: What if a student needs to GTA, but no one wants the student as a GTA - maybe the student did a bad job on their first GTA, maybe English is a problem?
A: This is first and foremost the responsibility of the student’s advisor. In most cases the student GTAs with the advisor. If not, the advisor works with the student to find a suitable GTA position. In the limit, the School assigns the student to GTA a specific course. The advisor, in consultation with the student and the faculty member in charge of GTA assignments, will have first taken steps to ensure that the student has remedied whatever the issues might have been.
Q: Do students normally GTA for a course taught by their advisor.
A: Yes, this is the norm but is not required. A student might benefit by GTAing some other course.
Q: Are there limits on the class size of the class being GTAd in order for it to count?
A: Yes, the size must be 25 or more unless explicit prior approval for a smaller class has been given.
Q: Can a student graduate if they have TA'd twice, but have failed one or both of the
mandatory TA classes?
A: No. If a student fails one of the courses, they must retake it and pass in order to graduate.
Q: Does being 'instructor of record' count as one of the TAships for this requirement?
A: Yes, teaching a course rather than being GTA satisfies one GTA requirement.
Q: Would a student who is either a GTA or an instructor of record who has considerable prior teaching experience in high school, college or other venues still have to take the appropriate first/second TA class?
A: Almost certainly yes. Exemptions from taking the TA classes will be granted only in exceptional circumstances (such as someone with many years full time teaching experience), and are at the discretion of the PhD coordinator. Exemptions are not granted from the TA requirement.
Q: Is there an expectation that the TA provide at least one lecture to the class? If so, should the professor be expected to watch and critique the lecture or can it be, for example while the professor is traveling.
A: This is not required, but some faculty may choose to do so, and GTAs should request to do should if they want to have this experience
Q: Does TAing an undergrad course count? Is there a preference, at least, for TAing grad courses?
A: Yes it does count. There is a preference that PhD students GTA grad courses, since MS students often are able to GTA undergrad courses. But this is not an absolute.
Graduate Student Council and Graduate Programs Office Travel Funds
What is this all about?
The Graduate Student Council has developed a policy for disbursing conference travel support for graduate students in the College of Computing (Masters and PhD students). The funding policy was developed with the goal of ensuring funds do not run out early in an academic year and to ensure students can apply for and be granted funding in a fair way.
GSC in conjunction with the Graduate Programs Office implemented this proposal in Spring 2007 to see how it worked in practice. The system was found to be fair and just, thus the policy continues to support travel for the CoC for graduate students. Each year funds will vary according to the budget for that fiscal year but the principles of disbursal will remain the same.
**If you require funding, please familiarize yourself with the application process below.**
Basic Policy Outline
There are two processes by which students can obtain travel funding
- The Graduate Programs Office disburses up to 50 small grants (up to $600 each) per year. Both Masters and PhD students in the CoC are eligible for this type of funding.
- A subcommittee of the Graduate Student Council issues up to 5 large grants ($1000 each) per year. Only PhD students are eligible for this type of funding.
Students may apply for both types of funding. However, if a student is awarded a $600 grant, s/he is ineligible to receive a $1000 grant. Similarly, if a student is awarded a $1000 grant, s/he is ineligible to receive a $600 grant.
Both policies are subject to change at any time. If you have questions about the funding policy, please email Dimetra Harris for questions about $600 grants or gsc-travel@cc.gatech.edu for questions about $1000 grants.
Application Rules for $600 grants
For $600 grants, GPO will handle the applications. To ensure even distribution of funds throughout the year, funds have been divided into monthly pots. e.g. Jan, Feb, March etc will each have a pot of money. Money will be essentially, the (total travel funds pots for the year minus the money for the large grants)/(12). All questions should be directed to Dimetra Harris.
$600 Grant Basic Rules:
- Students will only receive funding once per year – if a student has already received funding s/he will be put on a waitlist and if at the end of a month, there is money remaining s/he will be granted the funds. (This is to ensure funds are not left over).
- Students who are not presenting papers are given preference (since if you are presenting your advisor will likely support you)
If you are presenting a paper and your advisor will not support you, you can apply but must provide a letter from your advisor or email saying they will not support you.
- Students should indicate if they have applied to other sources of funding.
- Funds will be given on first come first serve basis if there is money available.
- Students will be allowed to apply from two months before the month their conference is in right up until the month their conference is in
e.g. If you have a conference in March – you can apply in Jan and Feb or March.
- For each month if there is money left over it rolls over to the next month (This will ensure money balances out over the months where there are fewer conferences and months where there are more conferences). Rollovers happen on the 1st of a month e.g. on Dec 1, the money for December rolls into January etc.
- Funds are deducted from the month in which the conference is held.
- Students may apply for both the $600 and $1000 grant; however, students who receive a GSC or GPO travel grant are ineligible to receive the other travel grant.
To apply, the following completed and signed documents should be submitted to Dimetra Harris.
- Complete in full, Travel Authority (TA).
- If you are employed by Georgia Tech, you can access the TA form after signing into TechWorks. Select Travel & Expense Reimbursement, then Create New Travel Auth.
- To download a paper form, access Travel Forms then select Travel Authority Form.
- Signed by student's Advisor or Division Chair.
- Complete in full, top portion Graduate Student Travel Form.
- Trip dates; conference name; location; etc.
- The graduate programs travel form does not require Advisor or Division Chair signature unless they provide funds for the trip.
- Signature of Division Chair or Advisor at # 1, 2, 3, or 4 at bottom of form
- Graduate Programs staff will not accept a Graduate Student Travel Form without a Travel Authority attached.
- Travel Authority and Graduate Programs Forms with signature(s) and pertinent information should be submitted to Dimetra Harris in CCB 303 for final processing.
Application Rules for $1000 grants
For $1000 grants, GSC will handle the applications. All questions should be directed to gsc-travel@cc.gatech.edu.
$1000 Grant Basic Rules:
- Application periods and bins are set here so that people can be notified if they receive a large grant at least 1 month before their conference (so they can plan to get other funding if they don't get it)
- A GSC sub committee will accept applications, and rank them at the end of an application period and send them to the CoC administrators who will get the final word on who gets the $1000 awards.
- Only 1 $1000 grant can be awarded per area in an academic calendar year for fairness (Areas are HCI, LST, IS, etc)
- $1000 grants are only for PhD students.
- The application periods are:
- For conferences in Sept 1 - Oct 31, applications are accepted from Jun 1 - Jul 31; notification is Aug 3
- For conferences in Nov 1 - Jan 31, applications are accepted from Aug 1 - Sept 30; notification is Oct 3.
- For conferences in Feb 1 - April 30, applications are accepted from Oct 1 - Dec 31; notification is Jan 10
- For conferences in May 1 - June 30, applications are accepted from Jan 1 - Mar 31; notification is April 3.
- For conferences in Jul 1 - Aug 31, applications are accepted from Apr 1 - May 31; notification is Jun 3.
- Students may apply for both the $600 and $1000 grant; however, students who receive a GSC or GPO travel grant are ineligible to receive the other travel grant.
- The GSC subcommittee for Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 is made up by Ceara Byrne (ceara.byrne@gatech.edu) and Ian Stewart (istewart6@gatech.edu).
Applications are evaluated based on these criteria in the order specified:
- Preference will first be given to people without papers (Reason: The GSC created this award primarily for students without support. The assumption is that advisors usually support students who have papers at conferences.)
- Preference given to more senior PhD students
- Preference given to importance of conference to student's research area
- Preference given to students who have not received CoC funding this year
- Only one student per Area can be selected in a calendar year (Areas are HCI, LST, IS, etc)
- Only one $1000 grant is available for each application period
How To Apply:
To apply, the following information should be submitted to gsc-travel@cc.gatech.edu during the appropriate application period.

**New Policy** If you are awarded a GSC travel grant and for any reason cannot attend the conference, please notify the GSC travel committee as soon as possible. If you are awarded a travel grant and do not attend the conference, you will be ineligible to apply for the GSC travel grant in the future. Exceptions due to emergencies will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
College of Computing and GT requirements for Travel support
Before any GT travel, if you are granted a full or partial funding award, you must complete a Travel Authority (TA). The Financial Officer in your Area or Administrative point person can assist you with the "TA". Once it is completed, David White must sign it and you will be set to travel.
Once you return from your trip, you will have 15 days to complete a Travel Reimbursement form and submit to your Area Admin. person or Financial Officer with your "original" receipts, etc. to receive your reimbursement.
General GVC Area Questions
Scope
All PhD students in Geometric and Visual Computing (GVC) are expected to know the basic graphic principles and techniques (lightfield, ray-tracing and z-buffer scan-conversion, view control, scene graph computation, rendering pipeline operations) and the basic 2D graphics and 3D modeling terminology (topology, geometry), representation schemes (CSG, BSP, Voxels, octrees, triangle mesh) and techniques (key-frame animation, intersection calculations, convex hulls, marching cubes). They should also be aware of the major issues (geometric complexity, realtime performance, numeric accuracy, sampling artifacts) and research opportunities in the overall GVC area. The following is a list of examples of topics that students should be familiar with:
- Light (physics, color, lightfield, propagation, surface properties, BRDF)

- Acceleration techniques (strips, back face culling, occlusion, simplification, parallelism)
- Linear algebra (vectors, points, lines, planes, changes of coordinate system, transformations)
- Polygon processing (smoothing, refinement, resampling, area, center of mass)
- Intersections between geometric primitives in 2D and 3D (edges, triangles, polygons, spheres...)
- Topological operators and properties of point sets (open, interior, genus, manifold)
- Morphological operations and properties (Hausdorff distance, offsetting, medial axis, rounding, Minkowski sum)
- Enclosing bounds and triangulations of point clouds (convex hull, Delaunay, Voronoi, alpha-hull)
- Triangle meshes (representation, traversals, normals, curvature, components, genus, geodesics)

Sample Questions
- OPEN RESEARCH PROBLEMS: List the 5 most important open problems in the Geometric and Visual Computing area that you expect to be funded and researched actively over the next 10 years. Discuss the motivation and summarize the current state of the art. Explain the research issues and say what makes them hard. How would you attack them if you had to?
- COMPARE REPRESENTATIONS OF SOLIDS: Describe the following five representation schemes for solids: Boundary representation, CSG, BSP, Voxel, Octree. For each, describe in broad terms a typical data-structure and give the details of an efficient algorithm for classifying a point against a solid. Compare these five representations in terms of storage, performance of point-classification, and convenience for interactive design.
- PERFORMANCE ACCELERATION: Discuss the stages and factors that limit the performance of current generation hardware-assisted rendering pipeline architectures. Discuss all the general purpose graphic acceleration techniques that you know. For each, explain in broad terms the principles, fundamental algorithms, data-structures, expected benefits, and limitations.
- IMAGE-BASED RENDERING: Assuming that you can track the head of a visitor in front of a large 2 megapixel screen, you wish to give her the impression that the screen is actually a windowthrough which you can see a beautiful garden (where nothing moves). Explain precisely how you would acquire the necessary data, how you would store it, how much storage would be necessary, how you would render the images in realtime, and how much rendering power you would need.
- MORPHING: Consider two polygonal regions A and B. Describe in details four techniques for animating a morph between them. What does it mean for the morph to be smooth? What does it mean to be minimal? For each one of the techniques you described, discuss their smoothness, minimality, and domain.
- PERSPECTIVE: The perspective transformation used for 3D rendering maps a model point P=(x,y,z) to a point (x',y',z') so that (x',y') are the coordinates of the point where P appears on the screen. Typically, z' is chosen as a monotonic function of z, so as to ensure that depth order is preserved for z-buffer based hidden surface removal. Company X has proposed to set z'=z, normalized so that its range varies between 0 and 2^32-1, and to represent Z' as an integer. Explain why this approach does not work.
- SHADOW: Assume that the light source is the edge (u,v). It is not a point source, nor an area source. The scene comprises only two triangles connected to each other: (a,b,c) and (c,b,d). Both the light source and the triangles are above the floor. Explain very precisely how to compute the exact shadow (umbra) cast by the two triangles on the floor. In particular, provide a formal definition of the shadow and state its properties. Is it connected? Is it convex? Is it polygonal? Note that discrete methods which would use pixels or sample the edge are not appropriate. However, you may assume that geometric tools for generating simple shapes (rays, edge, planes, cones) and for computing their intersections are available.
- REGISTRATION: Consider a viewpoint V and three screen locations (P,Q, and R) through which you see the three vertices (A,B,C) of an equilateral triangle of edge length L. Assume that you are given the 3D locations of V, P, Q, and R. Explain how you would compute a possible location for the vertices (A,B,C).
- SELF-INTERSECTION: A piece of cloth is simulated by a triangle mesh and animated through physical simulation. However, the self-intersection detection algorithm is far too slow. Suggest a good algorithm that would detect self-intersections and explain in detail what it would do and how you would implement it.
- MORPHING: An algorithm that morphs between two convex planar polygons places them into two parallel planes z=0 and z=1, computes their convex hull H and computes the morph at time t between 0 and 1 as the intersection of H and the plane z=t. Assuming that the polygons are represented as circular lists of vertices in counterclockwise order, design a linear-time algorithm for computing H. Propose a way of representing the morph that allows to compute it at time increments using as few expensive arithmetic operations (multiplications, divisions) as possible.
- LIGHT: The intensity of perceived light coming from a point light source decays quadratically with distance. Explain why it is acceptable to assume (as we usually do in Computer Graphics) that the intensity of light preceived along an unobstructed ray remains constant. Discuss situations where this assumption is no longer appropriate. The amount of light emitted in direction V by a point on a smooth Lambertian surface with normal N is proportional to the dot-product of N with L. Explain why the intensity of light reflected by a Lambertian surface appears to be independent of orientation.
- SIMILARITY: You are given a family of similar shapes, for example the 3D models of the femur bone scanned or a large population. You want to compute the average of these shapes. Please discuss several registration and shape averaging approaches and comment of their strength and weaknesses.
- DEPTH: This question is about triangle rendering on a typical commodity PC graphics card. Be careful to notice which stage in rendering each sub-question is asking about.
- For triangles rendered in perspective, what is a typical treatment of the depth coordinate (usually z) by the vertex processor? What information does the vertex processor give to the next stage in the graphics pipeline?
- Describe the task of the triangle rasterization stage in a typical graphics card. Describe in particular how the depth information is treated.
- Describe how the per-fragment depth information is treated at the fragment processor to assure proper hidden surfaces.
- Explain why the particular depth value in (a) and (b) are used, and describe why problems can occur if the "obvious" depth is used.
- GLIDER: We want to roller-blade on an oriented manifold triangle mesh M in 3D. Our feet are never to leave the surface. We want our head to remain vertical with respect to the surface of the mesh at the point of contact. Furthermore, we want to slide at a constant tangential velocity (no acceleration component in a tangential direction with respect to M). Assume that we start at a point P of edge (A,B) and that we just entered triangle T, which has vertices (A,B,C), with an initial velocity vector V that is tangential to T. Please describe in details how you will compute the time t and position P’ when we leave T, and also how to identify the edge through which we exit T. Now, assume that we exit T through edge (B,C) and enter triangle T’ with vertices (C,B,D). Describe in details how to compute our new velocity vector V’ in T’. For simplicity, assume that you never hit a vertex.
- SHADOW: A point light source is located at (0,0,h). The floor is defined by z=0. Provide simple formulae for the coordinates (x’,y’,z’) of the floor-shadow P’ cast by point P=(x,y,z). Now express the transformation that takes P to P’ as the result of a multiplication by a 4x4 matrix (using homogeneous coordinates) followed by a division. Explain how such a formulation can be used for casting shadows of 3D objects, discuss its limitations, and compare it to other approaches for rendering shadows.
- TEXTURE: A small company presented a graphics card which performs texturing as follows. For any textured triangle, it projects it to the screen. For each pixel within the triangle's projection, it linearly interpolates texture coordinates from the projected vertices and uses the interpolated texture coordinates (after proper scaling) to look up the color from the texture. Does this approach work (explain)? If it does not, how can it be fixed?
- PROJECTION: Consider an ideal projector (with a point-sized bulb) that projects qualifier questions onto a screen. We don't assume anything about the orientation of the projector with respect to the screen (which means that the text on the screen will generally appear distorted). You take a picture of the projected text (again, with an ideal pinhole camera) from some (arbitrary) place in front of the screen, then do simple thresholding to extract the text and produce a slide out of your picture. Is it always possible to place the projector (with the new slide in it) so that the text shows up undistorted on the screen? Explain why.
- OCCLUSION: What is the shape of the perspective projection of an unobstructed ball? Justify your answer. Provide the details of a simple geometric calculation that would establish precisely whether a ball of center G and radius r is hidden from a viewpoint V by a triangle having vertices A, B, and C. Use 3D vectors rather than coordinates in the formulation of your solution. Discuss how such a test could be used to accelerate graphics.
- PERSPECTIVE: Consider a perspective transformation T that maps a point P=(x,y,z) to a point P'=dP/(d+z).
- Where are the viewpoint and the near and far clipping planes of the viewing frustum?
- What is the 3D image (result of a mapping by T) of the half-space z>0?
- What are the preimages by T of [0,d/2] and of [d/2,d]?
- What can you conclude? (Suppose for instance that your z-buffer had only one bit per pixel.)
- Prove that T maps planes onto planes.
- Why is this important?
- LIGHTFIELD: Consider a lightfield L of a 3D object S. Let B be the subset of the rays of L that miss S.
- Suggest a mathematical expression of a good approximation A of S in terms of B.
- Can you guarantee that A contains S or is contained in S? Explain.
- Suggest an efficient algorithm for generating a triangle mesh that approximates A.
- COLOR: Discuss which 3D graphic techniques are based on the assumption that the light reflected by a point P on object in direction T remains constant along the ray through P parallel to T, as long as the ray does not intersect an obstacle? Yet, we know that the energy dissipated by a point source diminishes with the square of the distance. So how can that assumption be true? Explain what is going on. Discuss the limitations of that assumption and their implication on the correctness of 3D graphics techniques.
- COLLISION: Briefly describe an algorithm to perform collision detection between N concave 3D objects moving around on a heightfield terrain. What is the O() runtime of this algorithm? Describe 4 general techniques to speed up the operation of this algorithm in practice, and present a brief analysis of where speedup would occur.
- NEIGHBOR: Having a number of sites in the plane, we want to find the one which is the closest (in the Euclidean metric) to a query point.
- Describe a heuristic based on space partitioning to speed up the queries of this kind for a given set of sites.
- Let's say that all the query points and sites live in some rectangle in the plane. How would you use the standard graphics hardware in a simple way to approximately (i.e. with pixel accuracy) answer the nearest neighbor queries?

GT Computing Community
The Office of Outreach, Enrollment, and Community is poised to present another semester of awesome activities and endeavors for the 3,000 plus students that we serve. These programs are designed to complement the academic development that you’ll receive in the classroom. We are better equipped to serve you as we’ve acquired new tools during over COVID 19 experience. It’s also our sincere hope that your respective endeavors have an even bigger impact in the field on computing.
Life at the College of Computing isn’t just academic, professional, or social and Georgia Tech offers a wide variety of ways to get involved and find your path.
The College of Computing faculty and staff will walk with you from the first day of college through your graduation from Georgia Tech. We provide a community-minded atmosphere, where students can step in and out of offices for advice, ask a question, or just to hang out.
Be sure to also follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for more fun content!
YouTube is our main platform to share our resources across the College of Computing community. We post content that we hope you’ll find useful, whether it be a past yoga session, a quarantine edition of healthy eating, or shared experiences by students, for students.
GT Community Resources
Pet Therapy
Pet Therapy
Interacting with dogs is a great way to cope with the stress that comes with being a college student. To give our students and staff a fun way to relax, we bring dogs to the College of Computing twice a semester for people to pet and cuddle. Pet therapy is also great for cardiovascular assistance and has calming effects.
Coaching
Coaching
Leveraging our strengths is something we don’t do enough. Many students deal with imposter syndrome, feelings of doubt and belonging, when they step foot onto Tech’s campus. We work with you to help you take control of your academic, personal, and career path and realize your full potential.
Impact Program
Impact Program
The Impact through Science, Technology, and Social Good or Impact Living-Learning Community (LLC) is a LLC and initiative open to all first-year students who are interested in exploring issues of diversity and social good, community engagement, and sustainability.
GameFest
E-Sports
GameFest is another community-based initiative that’s gaining momentum in the college. We currently sponsor Gamefest LAN competitions twice a year in addition to sponsoring students that participate in competitions outside of the College of Computing.
Please be on the lookout for upcoming announcements as it pertains to GameFest and initiatives!
Resiliency Testimonials
Resiliency Testimonials
Georgia Tech students juggle schoolwork, research, jobs, internship hunting, clubs, sports, and more at the same time. We are a group of students who have a huge work ethic, but sometimes it can be overwhelming. At the end of their four years, students graduate with a diverse and impressive set of experiences that they can pass down to future students. We are interested in creating a collection of resiliency stories that could help others see past the tumulus work of the day or week – that the grass is indeed greener on the other side. If interested, please email Troy Peace at tpeace9@cc.gatech.edu
Self-Care
Self-Care
We are firm believers in taking care of ourselves here in the college. In order for you to begin interacting with others and making a difference, it is imperative that show yourself the attention that you deserve. We host a series of events that promote self-care in Klaus Atrium throughout the year where you can drop in, chat and relax with us, and grabs some snacks for the road!
Nutrition
Nutrition
Nutrition is an essential part of success for every student. Programs exist throughout every semester to give students advice and recommendations on how to eat healthy on a budget. The CoC partners with Health Initiatives at STAMPS to discuss these topics. Whether you are cooking for the first time or are a seasoned chef, there is always something new to learn.
Mental Health and Wellness
Mental Health and Wellness
Mental health is and remains a priority in the College of Computing, especially during this time. We have our in-house counselor Scott LaSalle located on the first floor of the College of Computing building. We also plan workshops and partner with Stamps Health Services to provide a safe space and facilitate the tough conversations around mental health. Finally, we believe that meditation is an excellent way to escape the hectic life of a Tech student. Join us for meditations to reduce stress, control anxiety, and enhance self-awareness
Transfer Chats
Transfer Chats
The transfer chats are a way for new and old transfers to engage with the community staff and other transfers in a way they might not have known. It is easy for many transfer students to miss a lot of the opportunities that are offered to them in the CoC and these discussions help to teach them the serves available as well as for them to get their voices heard by staff and discuss what things they want to see offered in the current semester and beyond.
Community Podcast
Community Podcast
The community podcast is a biweekly discussion with members of the Georgia Tech CoC community where individuals have an opportunity to tell their stories and speak about their experiences at Georgia Tech. Although the format is similar, the responses and stories from each person create a unique and human dialogue that serves to help those who sometimes feel isolated in difficult times.
Yoga
Yoga
College of Computing Yoga is a weekly aspect of the College of Computing Community. Each Friday we gather to unwind and decompress from the week’s activities. Classes are designed to be made for those who have a wide range of skill levels. Whether you have years of experience or no experience the hour-long practice will be time well spent.

- DIFFERENCE AND DISTANCE BETWEEN POLYHEDRA: Let A and B be two sets. Provide precise definitions for the minimum distance between them, for the Hausdorff distance between them, and for the volume of their symmetric difference. Illustrate the differences between these measures on 2D examples. Especially show examples of drastically different sets with a small Hausdorff distance and a large difference and also of sets with a small volume difference and a large Hausdorff distance. Provide efficient algorithms for computing them when A and B are two convex polyhedra, each represented by a triangle mesh.
- SUBDIVISION SURFACES: Define what are subdivision surfaces. Describe in details two subdivision schemes for triangle meshes. Discuss their drawbacks. How would you convert a manifold triangulated surface into an approximating subdivision surface. How could you use such a multi-resolution model to edit large features of a 3D shape while preserving small details.
- SKELETON. A basic notion in modeling is that of a skeleton: a minimalist representation of an object's geometry and/or topology. Describe several methods that can be used to extract or represent an object's skeleton.
- MORPHOLOGY: Mathematical morphology is an elegant way to cast the problem of representing shape in a set-theoretical framework. Describe its basic concepts and operations (closing, opening, erosion, dilation, structuring elements, etc.) Illustrate them on 2D examples.
- SIMPLIFICATION: A long-standing problem concerns the reduction in the number of polygons to reduce overall model complexity. Describe some of the well known methods to accomplish this, contrasting their respective advantages and disadvantages.
- CURVES AND SURFACES: What is a B-spline curve? How do you subdivide a control polyline in 3D so that in the limit you obtain a cubic Bspline? How do you convert a control polyline of a cubic Bspline curve into a series of Bezier control polygons that represent segments of the original Bspline curve.
- PRIMITIVE SHAPES. Formulate the parametric and implicit representations for a circular cone and a torus. Explain how these should be used for testing point-containment and for computing intersections with rays and the normal at these intersections.
- DIGITIZATION: It is often desirable to digitize a 3D object and then create a model of the object for subsequent analysis or visualization. A number of 3D digitization approaches exist: Describe these, pointing out their relative advantages/disadvantages, and discuss how a surface representation (either polygonal or parametric, for instance) can be built up from the collected data.
- DELAUNAY AND VORONOI: Explain what is a Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in the plane and what is their Voronoi diagram. Describe precisely the relation between these two and how one may be derived from the other. Provide a simple yet reasonably efficient algorithm for computing the Voronoi diagram of V points in 2D. What is the asymptotic complexity of this algorithm?
- PLAN PARTITION: The difference between a plane P and the union of L lines in P in general position is a set of R maximally connected regions. Define the properties of these regions and express L precisely as a function of R (prove your formula). Each region may be identified by L bits. Each bit indicating whether the region lies on the left or on the right of the corresponding line. How many possible regions could be defined by all the combinations of values for these bits? Provide an efficient algorithm that would discover which of these combinations correspond to non empty regions. What is the complexity of this algorithm?
- ALPHA-SHAPES: Given a set of P points in the plane, describe in details an algorithm that would interpolate these points by a well chosen set of triangles and lines.

- NUMERIC ACCURACY: Explain why integers are more effective than floats for representing the coordinates of the vertices of a polyhedral 3D model. Outline a process of computing the most accurate k-bit integer representation for each vertex coordinate. What should be the minimum k for locating cities on a map of the US? What should be k for modeling a car engine with 1mm accuracy? Explain why fixed precision computations may lead to drastic errors in the computation of the intersection between two polyhedra. Discuss epsilon-based and exact techniques to overcome this problem.
- MINKOWSKI OPERATIONS: Define the Minkowski sum between two sets and illustrate it in 2D. Provide a simple and efficient algorithm for computing it for two convex polygons in 2D. Explain precisely how such operations may be used to reduce a translational path planning of an object amongst obstacles to the search of a trajectory of a point in free space. Explain how combinations of Minkowski operations may be used to eliminate details and noise and to round corners.

Discuss how they relate to each other and their use for interactive a 3D navigation and internet access. Provide a high level description of the algorithmic processes involved in each one of these technologies and point out the interesting research avenues.
-
CONSTRICTION: You are given a manifold triangle mesh M in 3D that has two bounding loops, A and B, where the vertices are arranged along a regular circle of radius r. M is represented using the Corner Table or some equivalent data structure, so that you can use corner operators: c.v, c.t, c.n, c.s. M is an irregular triangulation of a long, winding tube. Explain how you would compute the key constriction: the place where the area of the cross-section of the tube passes by a global minimum. The problem is that the term ‘constriction’ is not well defined. Please do your best to define it.
-
STEADY PATTERN: You are given two edges E(A0,B0) and E(An,Bn) in 3D. Explain how you would compute a steady pattern of n-1 intermediate edges that starts with edge E(A0,B0) and finishes with edge E(An,Bn). (A pattern is steady if there exists a transformation T such that E(Ai+1,Bi+1) = T(E(Ai,Bi)). Explain your overall approach and provide some guidance (not necessarily all the details) about how to compute it. Is the motion we define unique?
-
ROOMS: M is a triangle mesh with T triangles, E edges, and V vertices. M is connected. Each edge bounds at least 2 triangles. No vertex is a junction (i.e., removing any single vertex will not change the genus or number of components). M (i.e., the closure of the union of its triangles) decomposes three-space into a set of rooms (connected components of the complement of M), including one external, infinite room. Provide an outline and enough details to guide an implementation of an algorithm that computes the number n of rooms. Explain what data structure and operators you would like to have to support your algorithm.
-
BENT CAPLET: Consider three disjoint balls with centers A, B, C and with respective radii a, b, c. Explain how they may be used to define a bent caplet: A solid bounded by a smooth surface that contains a portion of Sph(A,a) and Sph(C,c) and is hugging (tangential contact) Sph(B,b) along the way. Provide first a high-level outline and then enough detail to guide an implementation of an algorithm that would render the bent caplet. Explain why the solution of using Neville’s algorithm in 4 space (3 coordinates and radius) may fail to produce a smooth surface and how your solution fixes the problem.

Janet L. Kolodner – Interactive Computing Regents’ Professor Emeritus, cognitive learning
Regents’ Professor Emerita Janet L. Kolodner joined GA Tech’s School of Information and Computer Science (ICS) in December 1980, and retired from the School of Interactive Computing in August 2014, with almost 34 years of service. She is a Fellow of the Association for Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and an Inaugural Fellow of the International Society for the Learning Sciences. She was founding Director of Georgia Tech's EduTech Institute; founding Editor in Chief of The Journal of the Learning Sciences and Editor-in-Chief Emeritus; and a founder of the International Society for the Learning Sciences (ISLS) and its first Executive Officer. From 2010-2014, she was a program officer at the US National Science Foundation and led efforts to establish and sustain the Cyberlearning Program.
Janet's research has addressed a wide variety of issues in learning, memory, and problem solving, both in computers and in people. During the 1980s, she and her students pioneered the computer method called case-based reasoning (CBR), which allows a computer to reason and learn from its experiences. The first case-based design aids (CBDA'S) came from her lab. Archie-2, for example, helped architecture students with conceptual design. During the early 1990s, she and her students used the cognitive model implied by case-based reasoning to address issues in creative design. JULIA planned meals, Creative JULIA figured out what to do with leftover rice, and ALEC simulated Alexander Graham Bell in his invention of the telephone. During the 1990s, she also became a designer of middle school science curriculum and learning technologies informed by CBR’s cognitive model. The approach, developed in collaboration with a wide variety of post-doctoral fellows and research scientists, called Learning by Design (LBD), is design-driven, inquiry-oriented, and project-based; children learn science in the context of design experiences. The sequencing of activities encourages students to reflect on their experiences in ways that CBR says are appropriate for productively integrating what they are learning into memory. LBD curriculum units and the sequencing structures from LBD are integrated into a published 3-year middle-school science curriculum called Project-Based Inquiry Science (PBIS).
In later work, Janet and her students investigated how to help pre-teens and young teens consider who they are as thinkers and come to value informed decision making and informed production and consumption of evidence in the context of design-based learning activities. In Kitchen Science Investigators, 5th and 6th graders came to think about themselves as scientific reasoners and kitchen scientists in the context of cooking and baking. In Hovering Around, they did so in the context of designing hovercraft. Those investigations and a recent investigation of the use of Harvard’s EcoMUVE in middle-school classrooms are leading to suggestions about how to design project challenges and virtual worlds that support their achievement so that they afford deep learning, motivate and sustain engagement over time, and foster student identities as accomplished and comfortable scientific thinkers and problem solvers.
Since September 2017, Janet has been a half-time faculty member in the Lynch School of Education and Human Development at Boston College. She has been designing an MA Program in Learning Engineering, the design of effective and engaging learning experiences. It will educate the next generation of applied learning scientists who will, she hopes, help to make our formal and informal educational spaces places of joyful learning. The first cohort of students will join the program in Fall Semester, 2019.

Class Zero
Dorothy Murray Crosland - Founder of Information Science at Georgia Tech
Crosland was born on Sept. 13, 1903, in Stone Mountain, Georgia, the daughter of Robert and Lena Jones Murray. She graduated from Girls’ High School in Atlanta in 1920 and earned her library degree in 1923 from the Library School of the Carnegie Library of Atlanta (later Emory University School of Library Science). After completing her education, she worked as an assistant cataloger and branch librarian at the Carnegie Library (now Atlanta- Fulton Public Library). In 1925, she became assistant librarian at the Georgia Institute of Technology, serving as acting librarian during Frances Newman’s leaves of absence. She was appointed librarian in 1927, a position she held until 1953 when her title was changed to director of libraries. She retired from Georgia Tech in 1971.
Crosland belonged to numerous professional organizations and received many honors. In 1945, she was named Atlanta’s Woman of the Year in Education, and in 1969, was named Woman of the Year in Professions. Georgia Tech made her an honorary alumna in 1961, and in 1962, the library staff association and friends presented an oil portrait of Crosland to the library. The governor proclaimed April 13, 1971, as Dorothy M. Crosland Day.
Crosland was instrumental in the founding of a graduate program in information science in 1963, which evolved into the College of Computing. She also played a key role in securing the admission of women to Georgia Tech.
At President Blake Van Leer’s request, she surveyed colleges and universities to determine which offered engineering and architecture degrees to women.
Discovering that Georgia was the only state that did not have a private or public engineering or architecture school for women, she wrote a persuasive letter to Rutherford Ellis, Education Committee chair for the Board of Regents, urging them to permit women to attend Tech. As a result, Georgia Tech admitted its first women students. Crosland also became responsible for furnishing and decorating the women’s dorm, then a house on Fifth Street.

B.S. 1959 – Industrial Management - Imlay had many talents and many passions. Born in Jacksonville, Florida, and raised in Savannah, Georgia, Imlay moved to Atlanta in 1954 to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology and never looked back. His love of Atlanta influenced his career in software, his angel investing, his philanthropy, his friends, and his family.
Following early years at Honeywell and Univac, in 1970 Imlay took a bankrupt company, Management Science America (MSA), and built it into one of the nation’s most successful software companies. MSA also became an incubator for technology executives whom Imlay mentored as they made their own way, spawning some 100 new companies.
MSA went into the public market in 1981 and in 1990, Imlay sold MSA to Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. To further mentor the burgeoning technology community in Atlanta, Imlay established Imlay Investments, Inc. Over the next 20 years, he worked with more than 120 technology companies as an angel investor.
In 1990, he established The Imlay Foundation, Inc., which continues to be a mainstay of philanthropy in Atlanta and Scotland, with an added emphasis on fostering small, entrepreneurial nonprofits, reflecting his business career.
Imlay was an avid golfer and sports fan, purchasing an interest in the Atlanta Falcons in 1991. He also helped build the legacy of his hero, Bobby Jones, through the support of the Bobby Jones Scholars, the Bobby Jones Ethics Program at Emory University, founding Friends of Bobby Jones, sponsoring The Art of Golf exhibit at The High Museum, and countless speaking engagements on his favorite subject – Bobby Jones.
As a golfer, Imlay was a member of seven golf clubs in Atlanta and Scotland. his love of Scotland was anchored in Westerdunes, the home he and his wife, Mary Ellen, restored and enjoyed in North Berwick for more than 25 years. The Imlays hosted hundreds of their favorite people in their Scottish home.

HCI area - Design
Design lies between the modeling and evaluation needed to determine the needs of an interface and whether the interface meets those needs. It lies conceptually above the interface software and technology. Design is where you choose the kinds of interface software and technologies that are needed for users and shape it in the way that is coherent, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing.
We distinguish between two kinds of HCI knowledge with respect to HCI: Design process and design product. Design process is how you go about arriving at an interface design. Design product is about the elements in that interface design, such as metaphor, optional support for novices, direct manipulation vs. text commands, and so on.
Design Process
Design process focuses on how one comes to make design decisions. A couple of the most common processes are Ethnographic and Scandinavian. Both are about coming to really understand how the users work. Ethnographic is about involving the designer in the community to understand it. Scandinavian is about involving the actual users in the design process. Students should know about these processes and how they are actually used. Just using a good design process doesn't guarantee a good design, of course -- and some very fine designs didn't use either of these processes! A good design process keeps in mind the challenges of designing for users' constraints. The papers by Markus, Suchman, and Nardi, in particular, highlight some of the general issues of design process. The books by Beyer and Holtzblatt and by Nielsen point out whole processes for designing HCI. You'll note a good bit of redundancy between this list and those in the Modeling and Evaluation section. That's on purpose. It's not clear where the line is between understanding the user in order to model her and understanding the user in order to design something for her.

Design Product
Design product is about what you actually put into the interface. The issues here have two levels:
- How you make the gross-level choices that you make. There is clearly an interaction between the interface and the task analyses that one does during modelling, e.g., direct manipulation or command-line?
- How you make the fine-grained choices that you make. Do you use a "desktop metaphor"? If not, what kinds of metaphors do you use?
Students are expected to be able to discuss issues of design with respect to the modeling process. Students should be able to talk about the kinds of tradeoffs that one might make in an interface design and why.
One of the best papers on the topic is the Gentner and Nielsen piece "The Anti-Mac Interface" (citation below). The authors describe the Mac interface in terms of the design decisions made, and then point out that completely reversing each of these design decisions also defines a reasonable and coherent interface but for a different set of users and tasks.
A classic book on the topic is Designing Interaction edited by John Carroll (1991, Cambridge University Press). The chapters on "Cognitive Artifacts" by Don Norman, "The Task-Artifact Cycle" by Caroll, Kellogg, and Rosson, "Interface Problems and Interface Resources" by Stephen Payne are particularly good for highlighting design issues at the level we're describing here.

HCI area - Quantitative and Qualitative Modeling and Evaluation
Introduction
Two activities go hand-in-hand in a majority of HCI research: modeling and evaluation. Modeling addresses what you know about the user, and often their surrounding social and physical environment. A variety of existing models, such as the Human-Model Processor, and modeling techniques, such as Contextual Inquiry, address differing domains and levels of specificity. Models may be used to predict performance, organize field data, and describe potential interactions with a computer interface. As you read, examine the various models and modeling techniques that provide the foundation for the research. When will these models be useful in other research settings? What do you need to know to complete a model? How can you gather that information?
One use of models is to inform the evaluation of an interface. These activities are linked as the specificity and domain of the models constrains the questions that can be addressed in an evaluation. You will notice that specific, quantitative models are used to inform specific, quantitative evaluations. Likewise, more general, qualitative models are often the basis for various qualitative studies. The feasibility of combining various evaluation techniques is influenced by the compatibility of the underlying models. If the models make conflicting assumptions about the user, perhaps even disagreeing on what can or cannot be known, then the validity of combining evaluation techniques is in question.
One of the distinguishing characteristics of the HCI area in Computer Science is the importance of evaluation of how any computer-assisted system impacts its intended user population. Evaluation in HCI (and other human-centered disciplines) is quite different from evaluation in other areas of Computer Science, mainly because it is sometimes hard to construct experiments or observations that give definitive quantitative answers regarding the merit of one system over another. Instead, evaluation in HCI consists of demonstrating a scientific approach to answer questions about a systems relative merit in its context of use. This approach can consist of a myriad of techniques. Sometimes, a very reliable quantitative result is derivable, as is the case in narrowly-focused human motor observations such as a Fitts' Law experiment or a Keystroke-Level Model analysis. Other times, when the impact on work practices is sought, it is nearly impossible to control all influences in a natural setting. A student of HCI should become familiar with the variety of evaluation techniques and develop a sense of suitability of these techniques.
One of the best ways to achieve the ability to critique evaluation approaches is to read examples of evaluation work in the literature. As you read, critique the research based on the repeatability of the experimentation (Could a competent researcher reproduce the findings following the procedures described by the authors?) and the strength of the analysis and conclusions (Did the authors do enough to convince you of their evaluation results?) This is a particularly good way to assess quantitative results, and although this criteria can be used in the assessment of qualitative research, another useful criteria is to ask about the depth of explanation of the particular phenomena being reported.
One way to organize the information that you gather is to fill in the simple, 2x2 matrix:
|Modeling||Evaluation|
|Quantitative|
|Qualitative|
You should pay attention to the horizontal connections between modeling and evaluation techniques. Likewise, notice the connections and disconnections between quantitative qualitative techniques.
General Resources
Surveys and detailed coverage of many modeling and evaluation techniques are covered in CS 6750: Introduction to HCI. Follow on courses such as CS 6455: User Interface Design and Evaluation address Qualitative Methods, while courses such as PSYC 6018 Principles of Research Design and PSYC 7101 Engineering Psychology I: Methods address Quantitative Methods. Being familiar with both, as well as being able to pick which methods are suitable for your own research is an essential skill for an HCI researcher.
Many papers in the SIGCH conference series on Human Factors in Computing Systems, also known as the CHI conference, include significant modeling and evaluation work, both quantitative and qualitative. This is also true of the CSCW conference series (both the ACM CSCW conference and the European ECSCW series), though CSCW research tends to include more qualitative modeling and evaluation. The ACM UIST conference usually does not emphasize modeling and evaluation as much, but there are occasional stellar papers that provide a judicious balance between technology development and evaluation.
Modeling
Fitts' Law, Model-Human Processor and GOMS
Many quantitative models arise from the Human Factors literature. Some models are best suited for describing expert (decision-free), simple motor and cognitive activities. The most well-known examples are Fitts' Law and GOMS. There have been numerous examinations of Fitts' Law in the context of graphical user interface design. Bill Buxton has published several papers on applications and extensions of Fitts' Law. A good example is:
- I. Scott MacKenzie, William Buxton. (1992) Extending Fitts' Law to Two-Dimensional Tasks. Proceedings of ACM CHI'92 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems pp. 219-226.
GOMS is based on a well-known model of human cognition and behavior, the Model-Human Processor. The following paper describes this model as well as the Keystroke Level Model, first defined by Card, Moran and Newell:
- Card, S.K., Moran, T.P and Newell, A. The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction, Lawrence Erlbaum, 1983.
This work is the foundation for the GOMS family of evaluation techniques. GOMS has been one of the few widely known theoretical concepts in human-computer interaction. Two recent and good survey articles on the history and applications of GOMS are:
- Bonnie E. John and David E. Kieras. (1996) Using GOMS for User Interface Design and Evaluation: Which Technique? ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, v.3 n.4 p.287-319.
- Bonnie E. John and David E. Kieras. (1996) The GOMS Family of User Interface Analysis Techniques: Comparison and Contrast. Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction v.3 n.4 p.320-351.
Other Theories of Human Cognition
Other theories of human cognition examine the relationship between information in the head, such as a plan, and information in the world, such as a written to-do list. These theories may be the basis for both qualitative and quantitative models and evaluation techniques. Three contrasting theories are: situated activity, activity theory, and distributed cognition:
- Suchman, L. A. (1987). Plans and Situated Actions: The problem of human-machine communication. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. (Also see http://jupiter.informatik.umu.se/~mjson/hcipd/suchman.html) Also available as (2006) Human-Machine Reconfigurations: Plans and Situated Actions 2nd edition.

- Halverson, C. (2002), Activity Theory and Distributed Cognition or What Does CSCW Need to Do With Theories?, Journal of CSCW.
Interaction Models
Some useful models explicitly place the user interacting with a computer interface. These models can be used to compare different interface designs. See:
- Hutchins, Hollan, and Norman (1986) Direct Manipulation Interfaces, in Donald Norman and Stephen Draper, User Centered System Design, 1986, pp. 87-124.
- Michel Beaudouin-Lafon (2000) Instrumental interaction: an interaction model for designing post-WIMP user interfaces, Proceedings of CHI'2000, pages 446-453.
Contextual Inquiry and Design
Contextual Inquiry is a set of methods for gathering qualitative information and human activity in a complex, social setting. A variety of models are used to represent these multivariate environments. Contextual Design is a methodology for using these models to inform an interface design.
- Beyer, H & Holtzblatt, K. (1998) Contextual design: Defining customer-centered systems. San Francisco: Morgan Kaufmann.
Gathering Qualitative Data
A common method for gathering qualitative data is interviewing. This short book is an indispensable guide:
- Interviewing as Qualitative Research, by I.E. Seidman
Two texts that cover the collection and analysis of Qualitative data are:
- Analysing Social Settings by Lofland and Lofland
- Strauss A, Corbin J. Basics of Qualitative Research: Grounded Theory Procedures and Techniques now in 3rd edition.
Many researchers now promote using ethnographic techniques to gather data about complex, social settings. As an example, see:
- Hughes, Sommerville, Bentley & Randall. (1993) Designing with ethnography: Making work visible. Interacting with computers. Vol 5:2. Pp. 239-253.
Evaluation
Quantitative vs. Qualitative
The most basic distinction is between a quantitative or qualitative evaluation. In a quantitative evaluation, the purpose is to come up with some objective metric of human performance that can be used to compare interaction phenomena. This can be contrasted with a qualitative evaluation, in which the purpose is to derive deeper understanding of the human interaction experience. A typical example of a quantitative evaluation is the empirical user study, a controlled experiment in which some hypothesis about interaction is tested through direct measurement. A typical example of a qualitative evaluation is an open-ended interview with relevant users. Some resources:
- See Saul Greenberg's discussion of techniques.
Evaluation Techniques
There are a number of established evaluation techniques that are useful in different situations. When reading about these techniques, focus on understanding when a technique is valid, and the underlying model of human behavior.
Cognitive Walkthrough
The cognitive walkthrough technique is another example of a theory-based evaluation technique.
- Peter Polson, Clayton Lewis, John Rieman, Cathleen Wharton, (1992) Cognitive Walkthroughs: A Method for Theory-Based Evaluation of User Interfaces. International Journal of Man-Machine Studies v.36 n.5 p.741-773.
Discount usability
In contrast to the theory-based techniques, there are a range of evaluation techniques that are more practically based, relying less on a foundational theory of human performance or cognition. Two good examples of this class of evaluation techniques are questionnaires and heuristic evaluation.
Summative vs. Formative
An important question to ask when performing evaluation is when to perform the evaluation with respect to the overall life cycle of a system. Formative evaluation occurs prior to much investment in implementation of a design, whereas summative evaluation occurs after a full system has been deployed. Many evaluation techniques can be employed in either a formative or summative mode, but it is important to know what the difference is when applied before or after an artifact has been implemented. You must also take into account the co-evolutionary influence of human tasks and interaction technology.
What is enough evaluation?
It is also important to understand that within the HCI research community, there are different expectations for evaluation. We should not expect the same amount of evaluation efforts in a paper that talks about a toolkit supporting multimodal gesture recognition as we would in a paper concerned with the impact of some existing technology in a domestic environment. When reading a research paper in the HCI area, you need to determine what the appropriate expectations should be for user-centered evaluation and judge accordingly. Remember that all systems have users (a programmer uses a toolkit) and proper consideration for the needs of that user should always be apparent in HCI research.
HCI Special Topics - Information Visualization
Introduction
We are in an era of measurement, where sensors of all forms continuously capture phenomena and store them in data. While one would hope that the wealth of data would be an asset, too often the reverse is true: the volume of data simply serves to confuse and paralyze a person in a decision-making process. How do we build technology to help people make sense of their data, empowering them with insights to make decisions, produce scientific discoveries, and increase their understanding of the data-rich world we live in?
The field of Information visualization is the study of how people use symbols, images, graphics, and interfaces to help examine, analyze, and understand data and information. Here, the term "information" generally means abstract data that has no physical correspondence, such as baseball statistics, large text corpuses, customer purchase databases, telephone calling patterns, and so on. Understanding information visualization requires a person to learn about basic multivariate data characterizations, visual properties such as color and animation, general visualization techniques, and existing information visualization tools and systems.
The literature in this area selects readings from topics including: understanding of how to bind data attributes and values to visual encodings and visual metaphors, evaluating the effectiveness of a visualization to generate insights for users, leveraging toolkits and frameworks to create visualizations, and understanding the value that visualizations have in helping humans think about (and analyze) their data.
Most importantly, students seeking an in-depth understanding of the area should take the course, CS 7450 - Information Visualization.

HCI Special Topics - Ubiquitous Computing
Introduction
In a seminal 1991 Scientific American article, Mark Weiser commented that all profound technologies eventually vanish, meaning they become so commonplace in our everyday experience that we take them for granted. Weiser coined the phrase ubiquitous computing and lead a project at Xerox PARC bearing the same name. Over a decade later, ubiquitous computing, and related fields such as wearable computing and augmented reality, has become one of the major emerging themes in HCI research.
General Resources
Students of the area should read the following two seminal papers by Weiser:
- Mark Weiser. (1991) The Computer for the 21st Century, Scientific American, September, pp. 94-104.
- Mark Weiser. (1993) Some computer science issues in ubiquitous computing. Communications of the ACM, 36(7):75-84, July.
Initial papers in ubiquitous computing appeared in distributed computing and operating systems workshops and conferences, but starting in 1992, and increasingly in the late 1990's, a number of papers on novel technology (such as the Liveboard) and applications (such as Tivoli) appeared in HCI-relevant conferences such as CHI and UIST. In other conferences, such as MobiCom or Multimedia (ACM or IEEE), you will find some ubiquitous computing papers that focus mainly on applications level research. A good review of ubiquitous computing research over the decade of the 1990's and looking forward to the first decade of the 21st century is:
- Gregory D. Abowd and Elizabeth D. Mynatt. (2000) ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, special issue on HCI in the new Millenium, 7(1):29-58, August. PDF available on-line.
A number of relevant conferences have sprung up since the late 1990s, including:
- International Symposium on Wearable Computing (ISWC, since 1997)
- DARE (augmented reality, since 2000)
- Handheld and Ubiquitous Computing (HUC, since 1999)
Serious students of the subject should consider taking CS 7470: Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing. In addition, several advanced topics on novel interaction technologies (pen-based computing, recognition technologies) are briefly surveyed in CS 6456: Principles of User Interface Software. The Systems area course, CS 7210: Distributed Computing covers fundamental research issues in distributed computing, much of which is relevant in the construction of ubiquitous computing systems.
Technologies for Ubicomp
The following topics cover the wide variety of technological themes of ubiquitous computing research.
- handheld and wearable computing and other small form factor portable computing
- environmental computing, or instrumentation of the physical environment through tangible interaction techniques and embedded computing
- "off the desktop" interaction technology, such as pen, voice, gesture and sensing
- multimedia and multimodal interaction
- novel display technology for small and large form factors
Academic publications are not necessarily the best place to look for current information on emerging technologies relevant for ubiquitous computing. It is a good idea to keep informed of emerging technologies through familiarity with on-line trade publications, such as the Personal Technology Section on CNET. Other good sources are Ziff Davis and Wired News.
Application Themes
As Weiser pointed out, the whole purpose of ubiquitous computing is to create applications for humans. Several major applications themes have emerged in the first decade of ubicomp research, and students should familiarize themselves with canonical examples of these research areas, (reviewed in detail in the Abowd and Mynatt articled cited above):
- Context-Aware Computing. A major theme in HUC proceedings and ISWC as well. This theme ranges from novel applications of sensing to support useful application behavior to generalized support for the design and implementation of context-aware applications.
- Automated capture environments, starting from the initial Tivoli work at PARC. An important local example of this domain is the Classroom 2000 / eClass project, looking at capture in an educational setting.
- Natural interaction, as is provided through the use of recognition technologies.
Evaluation and Social issues
Grudin points out some of the challenges with evaluating groupware systems (see the CSCW summary in this body of knowlege). Many of these same challenges apply to ubicomp applications. In addition, pervasive computing technologies bring additional challenges to the researcher to prototype and understand the social implications of sometimes invasive techniques. A good handle of the classic HCI evaluation techniques and the qualitative techniques learned in CS 6455: User Interface Design and Evaluation, will lead the inquisitive student towards a better understanding of how to do proper and socially relevant HCI research in ubiquitous computing.

ML@GT Announces First Ph.D. Fellowship Program
Beginning in January 2020, the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) will be supporting select Ph.D. students through a new ML@GT Fellows Program. Created with the intent to foster novel Ph.D. research in machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI), the program expands Georgia Tech’s rapidly growing presence in the field.
“ML and AI is an increasingly important field in all aspects of life. As a center that works to train the next generation of leaders in socially and ethically responsible ways, we hope that this program will allow more students who are interested in the field to pursue their education,” said ML@GT Director Irfan Essa.
The center anticipates selecting four students who will receive roughly half of a graduate research assistant (GRA) appointment. While ML is a collaborative field with many subfields, the focus of projects must be on advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence methods that enable applications rather than creating the applications themselves.
The program is open to any Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who has a mentor or advisor that is affiliated with the center. Preference will also be given to students who are not already supported by a fellowship.
Applications for the fellowship are due on Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019 at 12 p.m. with award notices being sent by early January 2020.
Visit the application portal for more information and to apply.

Krishna Tapped as Deputy Director for $5.5 Million Department of Energy Artificial Intelligence Initiative
The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has given three institutions a $5.5 million grant to collectively find solutions to some of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence (AI) today. Scientists from Georgia Tech, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratory will collaborate to develop technologies that are core to the DOE’s priorities including cybersecurity, graph analytics, and electric grid resilience.
Tushar Krishna, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Machine Learning Center (ML@GT), will serve as a deputy director of the newly established Center for Artificial Intelligence-focused Architectures and Algorithms (ARIAA).
Georgia Tech is contributing expertise in modeling and developing custom accelerators for machine learning and sparse linear algebra. The institute will also provide access to its advanced computing resources.
“Georgia Tech provides a great environment to carry out this research, because of vibrant research centers such as ML@GT and CRNCH that bring together researchers from algorithms, compilers, architecture, circuits, and novel devices fostering collaboration and innovation,” says Krishna.
Centered around “co-design”, ARIAA is designed to help researchers strike the right balance between the capabilities of hardware and software. Finding the perfect balance allows researchers to corral the vastly different algorithms and architectures available that could best solve a given problem. While co-design is not new, the increasing popularity of AI has drawn it back into focus.
Another difficult challenge that continues to face researchers is how to best design supercomputers to that they are beneficial to the DOE in solving the nation’s most difficult problems in engineering, health, energy, and science. The project will aim to develop algorithms and architectures that can be applied to current and future systems.
The grant announcement reinforces the DOE’s commitment to accelerating the development, delivery, research, and adoption of AI, and supports President Trump’s plans for a national strategy to design AI technologies that are developed to positively impact American lives.
Hiring Guidelines
The College of Computing recognizes that students need time to make informed decisions when evaluating and responding to offers. We also recognize that employers need to effectively manage their time-sensitive recruitment processes. The following guidelines are intended to help both students and employers manage the offer process in a fair and transparent framework. We have created these guidelines to help minimize reneges, reduce the pressure put on our students, and align with the GT campus.
"Experience shows the best employment decisions for both students and employers are those that are made without pressure and with the greatest amount of information and transparency. Students are given sufficient time to attend career fairs, participate in on-campus interviews, and/or complete the interviewing in which they are currently engaged are more likely to make good long-term employment decisions and may be less likely to renege on job acceptances."

Impact Living Learning Community
The Impact Program is a relatively new aspect of the Community Services offered in the College of Computing. We’ve enhanced our services by creating cohorts for students that often find themselves without a network. Students often need someone to talk to. You need to know where to go in and outside of campus. They also need safe and convenient ways of getting there. They need a familiar face or faces that take the same classes and are experiencing the same issues. Sometimes there’s also a voice that they need to hear that connects them to teaching assistants, professors, or tutors. That voice also can also “suggest” calling home to mom or dad if there’s a need. I serve as that voice for many students in the College of Computing.
Questions:
If you have any questions or concerns as it relates to College of Computing Community Community events and programs or the Impact Living Learning Community please contact Director of the Computing Community Troy Peace at tpeace@cc.gatech.edu

Introduction
|
||
||
||
||
||
|
|We are in an era of measurement, where sensors of all forms continuously capture phenomena and store them in data. While one would hope that the wealth of data would be an asset, too often the reverse is true: the volume of data simply serves to confuse and paralyze a person in a decision-making process. How do we build technology to help people make sense of their data, empowering them with insights to make decisions, produce scientific discoveries, and increase their understanding of the data-rich world we live in?
|
|The field of Information visualization is the study of how people use symbols, images, graphics, and interfaces to help examine, analyze, and understand data and information. Here, the term "information" generally means abstract data that has no physical correspondence, such as baseball statistics, large text corpuses, customer purchase databases, telephone calling patterns, and so on. Understanding information visualization requires a person to learn about basic multivariate data characterizations, visual properties such as color and animation, general visualization techniques, and existing information visualization tools and systems.
|
|The literature in this area selects readings from topics including: understanding of how to bind data attributes and values to visual encodings and visual metaphors, evaluating the effectiveness of a visualization to generate insights for users, leveraging toolkits and frameworks to create visualizations, and understanding the value that visualizations have in helping humans think about (and analyze) their data.
|
|Most importantly, students seeking an in-depth understanding of the area should take the course, CS 7450 - Information Visualization.

Interaction
|
||
||
||
||
||
|
|User interaction in visualization lets people ask questions of their data, change representations to see alternative views, and perform other data-centric and visualization-centric operations to explore their data and gain insight. The papers below describe the different types of interactions that can be found in visualizations and the different ways that interaction and cognition go hand-in-hand. Finally, the third paper explores interaction beyond traditional desktop WIMP styles.

About Barcelona
Located on the Mediterranean Sea and offering a vibrant cosmopolitan atmosphere, Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, a unique region of Spain. Known for its cultural and artistic heritage, Catalonia’s contribution to 20th century art includes the architect Gaudí and painters such as Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí. Catalonia is a world-recognized model for blending art, culture, urban planning, and industry; the region combines a rich mixture of high-tech industries, culture, medical centers, and institutions of higher learning (numerous U.S. companies have a strong presence in Catalonia, and there are several colleges and universities serving the area). Both a major attraction and economically important aspect of Catalonia is its Mediterranean cuisine and its production of wines (such as Freixenet and Codorníu).
Barcelona was founded in the third century and has been ruled by Romans, Visigoths, Moors, and Franks over the centuries. The influences of these periods are still visible throughout the city. Since the Middle Ages, Barcelona has been a major port and commercial center, and is Spain's second largest city and a major industrial center.
Bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Pyrenees Mountains, Barcelona offers contrasting sights and experiences throughout the seasons and within relatively short distances. With the Costa Brava to the north and the Costa Dorada to the south, beautiful beaches surround this port city. Barcelona is close to Andorra and France, and also to the Balearic Islands (including its most famous island, Ibiza). There is an excellent, clean, and inexpensive network of bus, metro, and railroad services serving inner areas of Barcelona, as well as connecting the city to the region and the rest of Europe. In addition, a number of discount airlines flying into Barcelona (BCN) and the nearby Girona airport (GRO) render travel to destinations throughout Europe both inexpensive and flexible.
The people of Barcelona speak Catalan and Spanish, and many are fluent in French. Many Catalans speak English, as it is now required in public middle schools, and it is common to see signs in English and German, especially during the height of the summer tourist season. You need not speak Catalan or Spanish to fully enjoy Barcelona!
Barcelona is a city full of tree-lined boulevards, open spaces, and architectural diversity. Large public sculptures abound throughout the city, and the people of Barcelona (as do most Spaniards) take to these public parks and boulevards for their daily afternoon stroll (paseo). The city has preserved numerous historic places and combined them with the very modern. As host of the 1992 Summer Olympics, a number of new structures have emerged, with some areas within the city literally added by extending the land toward the sea. Perhaps the most striking aspect of Barcelona is the cultural pace of the city: each week, there are countless fairs, expositions, exhibits, performances, and artistic events from which to choose. Moreover, Barcelona has an amazing diversity of restaurants and cafes offering superb culinary experiences as well as informal, low-cost meals. And of course, there are the beaches. It is no wonder that Barcelona is a major tourist center and an increasingly active port of call for cruise ships. One of the most noteworthy and interesting characteristics of Barcelona is its dynamism: the city has continually re-invented itself by fusing art, history, politics, environmental concern, and commerce in what is generally considered to be a model of urban planning and development.

About Berlin
Berlin is the largest city in Germany, and is an economic, high-tech, and cultural hub for the whole of Europe. The city is probably best known for the famous Berlin Wall, which divided the communist East from the capitalist West during the Cold War. These days, the city is not only reunited, but also a hub for high-tech enterprise, including not only computing but also pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.
The city was founded in the 13th century at the crossing of two important trade routes, and it remains a place where different cultures meet and merge. The city is home to residents from more than 190 countries. Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany, and home to its parliament, called the Bundestag.
Berlin is the only city in the world with three opera houses. The city also houses more than 130 museums and more than 400 art galleries, as well as the world’s oldest large-scale movie studio complex. The Berlin International Film Festival is the largest in the world. And about 20 news agencies and more than 30,000 creative companies are located in Berlin, making it a major capital of culture stretching from the high art of the Renaissance to tomorrow’s industrial designs.
Getting to Berlin is easy, as the city is a major European air and rail hub. Once you arrive, you can use the city’s superb public transit, which includes trains, trams, buses and ferries-- make sure you have a map! Walking through the city is a striking experience, because so many historical periods are represented, stretching from a few remaining medieval buildings near Alexander Platz to the steel-and-glass towers at Potsdamer Platz.
Berlin has a younger population than most European cities, and is known as a place where people constantly produce new ideas-- in research, in commerce, and in art.

Machine Learning Center
The machine learning (ML) Ph.D. program is a collaborative venture between Georgia Tech's colleges of Computing, Engineering, and Sciences and is housed in the Machine Learning Center (ML@GT.) The lifeblood of the program are the ML Ph.D. students and the ML Ph.D. Program Faculty who advise, mentor, and conduct research with these students.
About the Curriculum
The central goal of the Ph.D. program is to train students to perform original, independent research. The most important part of the curriculum is the successful defense of a Ph.D. dissertation, which demonstrates this research ability.
The curriculum is designed with the following principal educational goals:
- Students will develop a solid understanding of fundamental principles across a range of core areas in the machine learning discipline.
- Students will develop a deep understanding and set of skills and expertise in a specific theoretical aspect or application area of the machine learning discipline.
- The students will be able to apply and integrate the knowledge and skills they have developed and demonstrate their expertise and proficiency in an application area of practical importance.
- Students will be able to engage in multidisciplinary activities by being able to communicate complex ideas in their area of expertise to individuals in other fields, be able to understand complex ideas and concepts from other disciplines, and be able to incorporate these concepts into their own work.
The curriculum for the Ph.D. in Machine Learning is truly multidisciplinary, containing courses taught in eight schools across three colleges at Georgia Tech:
- Computer Science (Computing)
- Computational Science and Engineering (Computing)
- Interactive Computing (Computing) – see Computer Science
- Aerospace Engineering (Engineering)
- Biomedical Engineering (Engineering)
- Electrical and Computer Engineering (Engineering)
- Industrial Systems Engineering (Engineering)
- Mathematics (Sciences)
Students must complete four core courses, five electives, a qualifying exam, and a doctoral dissertation defense. All doctorate students are advised by ML Ph.D. Program Faculty. All coursework must be completed before the Ph.D. proposal. An overall GPA of 3.0 is required for the Ph.D. coursework.
Research Opportunities
Our faculty comes from all six colleges across Georgia Tech’s campus, creating many interdisciplinary research opportunities for our students. Our labs focus on research areas such as artificial intelligence, data science, computer vision, natural language processing, optimization, machine learning theory, forecasting, robotics, computational biology, fintech, and more.
Admissions
External applications are only accepted for the Fall semester each year. The application deadline varies by home school.
The Machine Learning Ph.D. admissions process works bottom-up through the home schools. Admissions decisions are made by the home school, and then submitted to the Machine Learning Faculty Advisory Committee (FAC) for final approval. Support for incoming students (including guarantees of teaching assistantships and/or fellowships) is determined by the home schools.
After the admissions have been approved by the FAC, the home school will communicate the acceptance to the prospective student. The home school will also communicate all rejections.
Get to Know Current ML@GT Students
Learn more about our current students, their interests inside and outside of the lab, favorite study spots, and more.
Career Outlook
The machine learning doctorate degree prepares students for a variety of positions in industry, government, and academia. These positions include research, development, product managers, and entrepreneurs.
Graduates are well prepared for position in industry in areas such as internet companies, robotic and manufacturing companies and financial engineering, to mention a few. Positions in government and with government contractors in software and systems are also possible career paths for program graduates. Graduates are also well-suited for positions in academia involving research and education in departments concerned with the development and application of data-driven models in engineering, the sciences, and computing.

Mentoring Program
Mentorship is an important part of a student’s personal and professional development
At the College of Computing, we understand that a student’s college career is about discovery and growth – personally, professionally, and socially. While much of this growth takes place in the typical academic and social environments on campus, it also happens in the individual connections made with peers and alumni.
GT Computing students and alumni have several opportunities to participate in mentorship programs on-campus and virtually.
“Leaving my small, rural hometown for a far and unfamiliar city like Atlanta was a bit unsettling, but also very exciting. The assimilation to my new environment would have been more difficult if I was not part of a community. Instead of being thrown into the college experience alone, I was able to meet people, which made the adjustment more comfortable and enjoyable. By being a mentor, I will be part of that community to make sure each new student’s transition is positive, comfortable and enjoyable.”
Cody Kantor, BS CS ‘22
GT Computing First-Year Cohort Peer Mentor Program
Our primary goal for the first-year peer mentorship program is to assist our incoming students in making the transition to the College of Computing and the greater GT community as positive, and seamless, as possible. Through this program, mentors serve as campus role models and provide guidance to incoming students as they adjust to college life, become aware of campus culture and resources, and engage in various activities within the College of Computing and across campus.
Peer mentors are paired together in groups of 2-44 to support one of the incoming cohorts of computing students. Mentors can expect an average time commitment of about 1 hour per week during the summer and about 3 hours per week during the fall semester. In addition to the responsibilities below, mentors will receive monthly training on key topics associated with adjusting to the first year of college, as well as the opportunity to participate in select events and activities.
The responsibilities of a mentor include:
· Being a TA for CS 1100
· Communicating with incoming students during the summer and fall through social media, email, and other forms of communication
· Participating in 1 social event with their mentees each month throughout the fall semester
**Due to the increased size of the incoming class of 2025, we are seeking additional mentors for summer/fall 2021. If you are interested in becoming a peer mentor, please submit your completed application to Tamar Wilkins.**

MS Computer Science Admission Requirements
Admission to the program is highly selective; there are many more qualified applicants than there are places in the program. The challenge for the College every year is to select a class from a highly qualified pool. The College looks for compelling reasons to admit candidates, and the statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, test scores and GPA are all reviewed carefully. Having a strong undergraduate background in computer science, including C programming, is highly recommended for applicants. The Admissions Committee welcomes additional pertinent information that will aid in making objective and informed decisions.
Students are admitted to the master's program only once a year. The application deadline is Feb. 1 for admission to the following fall semester.
Application Requirements
- Completion of the online application.
- Receipt of three recommendation letters (requested within the on-line application).
- Scores from the general Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are required. Applicant scores are expected to be at least 153 in the Verbal, 155 in the Quantitative, and 3.0 in the Analytical sections for the MS program. This requirement cannot be waived.
- The desirable minimum GPA is 3.0/4.0, though most candidates score higher.
- See the Institute's English Proficiency Requirements. Our department requires a 100 minimum score on the TOEFL. We will also accept IELTS to fulfill english proficiency. A minimum overall score of 7.5 is required, with minimum section scores as follows: Reading 6.5, Listening 6.5, Speaking 6.5, Writing 5.5.
A student who is enrolled in another graduate program of the Institute may pursue an MSCS while that student is also pursuing his or her degree in the other major. To be granted permission to pursue the MSCS, a student must submit to the Office of Graduate Programs in the College of Computing the material required for admission to the MSCS program. This includes transcripts, letters of recommendation, and the GRE General Test. If the student is approved by the admissions committee to pursue the MSCS, the student will be notified in writing. At no time will a student outside the College be allowed to pursue a concurrent degree without prior permission of the admissions committee.

A complete application package is necessary before the faculty can consider a student for admission The admissions committee will only review applications officially submitted through https://grad.gatech.edu/apply-now
6. I am interested in your MSCS program but I do not have a computer science degree. Can I still be considered for admission?
Yes, you will be considered for admission. We review applications holistically in order to determine applicant’s suitability. The admissions committee considers several factors when making admission decisions; academic performance at prior institutions (GPA), experience, background, GRE test scores, statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation. In general, we expect students who enter the program to be very comfortable working with multiple programming languages such as C, Java, and Python (there is no provision within the program for make-up any deficiencies) and to have taken several more advanced topics, such as Advanced OS, Networking, Theory, and/or Algorithms.
7. What can I do to be competitive? What do you recommend for applicants without a CS undergraduate background?
The following is what we recommend for applicants without a strong undergraduate background in computer science:
1. Must know how to program
2. C programming (proficient)
3. Java
4. Algorithms
You can gain this knowledge through undergrad classes, MOOC, or learn it through work experience.
8. What types of prerequisite courses?
The student should have an undergraduate level of proficiency in core computer science areas including operating systems, design and analysis of algorithms, formal languages and automata theory, networking and communications, theory/algorithms, and computer architecture. If any remedial coursework is needed, it will be assessed by our faculty and discussed with you during orientation.
9. My GRE score is below your minimum, can I still apply and be considered for admission?
You would not be automatically disqualified from consideration. Applicant scores are expected to be at least 153 in the Verbal, 155 in the Quantitative, and 3.0 in the Analytical sections for the MS program. We consider the strength of your overall application, including your educational and professional background, your performance at prior institutions (GPA), statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation. All of these factors are important, and your application will be strengthened if your GRE scores are at or above these average values. If your GRE scores are lower than these averages, your chances for admission will be reduced. You may retake the GRE, TOEFL, or IELTS to improve your score as many times as you wish. We will accept the highest score attained in each category.
10. My TOEFL is below the minimum, can I still apply and be considered for admission?
You are welcome to apply however, we generally do not accept applicants with less than 100 because most of our applicants exceed the minimum TOEFL. You may want to consider retaking the TOEFL.
11. Do you accept IELTS?
Beginning Spring 2020, we will accept IELTS in place of TOEFL. A minimum overall score of 7.5 is required, with minumum section scores as follows: Reading 6.5, Listening 6.5, Speaking 6.5, Writing 5.5.
12. What is the Department Code to request my GRE and TOEFL scores?
As long as you request the test from ETS using Institute Code 5248 we will receive the scores. When test scores are received from ETS and entered into Georgia Tech system, they are available for all degree programs to view.

37. I am currently pursuing an MS CS at a different institution and would like to transfer to your program. Do you allow students to transfer?
Students are not allowed to transfer to our program as they must apply with all other applicants. Learn more at our MS CS admissions requirements page.
Georgia Tech Master’s students are only allowed to transfer in a maximum of 6 credit hours.
38. I was denied admission. I am disappointed that I was not accepted into your program. I feel that my record is very good. Can I find out what was wrong with my application?
Admission decisions are final. Our degree program is extremely competitive and due to space and financial limitations we can only enroll a small number of students and must decline many qualified applicants. The decision to accept is based on many factors including the GPA, letters of recommendation, GRE, area of interest of the student, TOEFL, available funding for students who want to pursue a Ph.D., specific faculty interest in the student, and available space. Many of these factors are not visible to students. Unfortunately, due to the volume of applicants, we cannot give specific feedback for any one student.

Computing Equity Project: Impacting Public Schools
Since the passing of Senate Bill 108 (SB 108), schools across Georgia have been gearing up to offer computer science classes for high school students.
SB 108 says that school districts across the state must offer computer science education courses to all Georgia high school students by the 2024-25 school year. It also recommends that all middle schools offer CS courses as well.
With teacher shortages and the reality that some teachers don’t have a computer science background, this transition has taken a great deal of collaboration.
One of the Georgia Tech Constellations Center for Equity in Computing’s answers to these needs is the Computing Equity Project (CEP).
The CEP creates a cohort of CS equity coaches to help foster the inclusive and equitable environment that Constellations has been working toward since its founding.
“The computing equity project is a way to continue to advocate for equity and inclusion in CS. The focus of the coaches is to provide teachers with best practices for creating identity-inclusive computing, as well as culturally relevant/culturally responsive pedagogies, and content,” Sababu Barashango, Constellations fellow.
Constellations currently has three fellows, two that go into Atlanta Public Schools and coach teachers so that they are prepared for the changes coming in the next year, the third fellow, works to support computing equity at the state level.
The coaches are educators with a wide array of background experience from across the state and the country.
There are six coaches:
- Mike Afdahl is the Coordinator of Technology Services for Northwest GA RESA.
- Laura Crunk has been a teacher for more than 15 years.
- Wendy Dyer, a native of Social Circle, Georgia, has been an educator since 1998.
- Kimberly Nichols earned her Bachelors of Business Administration in finance from East Tennessee State University, an MBA from Kennesaw State University, and M.Ed. and Ed.S.
- LaWanda Stephens-Sanford is a United States Marine Corps veteran who became a teacher in a non-traditional way.
- Philisia Spearmon is a computer science and mathematics teacher at Tattnall County High School and an adjunct professor for Southeastern Technical College.
Each coach brings a very individualized approach to education with diversity being the road to inclusion and feelings of belonging.
Constellations’ broader programming includes teacher professional development workshops, hosted each semester, the Constellations summit hosted annually, and similar events throughout the year to help teachers prepare for changes in the state education curriculum.
The CS equity coaches allow Constellations to extend its reach in a more concentrated effort.
“We’re using this holistic approach in hopes of creating a trickle-down effect by fostering community by creating CS equity teams, promoting the retention of diverse CS educators, in efforts to cultivate achievement from students from underrepresented populations,” said Barashango.
The CS equity coaches are just an added layer in the effort to affect more school districts state-wide, through representation, culturally relevant teachings, and community.

Biography
Dr. Rozga is a research scientist in the School of Interactive Computing. She is a developmental psychologist with an interest in autism and related developmental conditions. Her current research lies at the interdisciplinary boundary between developmental psychology and computing. She asks questions regarding how the behavior of individuals with autism emerges and transforms over time. To find answers, she applies novel sensing capabilities, and computationally driven measurement and modeling. This work is leading to novel ways of capturing and quantifying complex human behaviors, as well as developing new understandings of these behaviors, both among typically developing individuals and those with autism. The ultimate goal is to make these new measurements and modeling techniques work outside the lab, in real-world environments like the home, schools, and clinics where there is a need for more objective, reliable means of tracking the emergence of autism and its developmental course.
Dr. Rozga also has a broad interest in exploring how technology can impact research and clinical care of autism. Recent projects in this space include evaluating a novel telehealth tool to support remote diagnosis of autism using videos recorded by parents in the home, and developing and evaluating motion-based games to support engagement and collaboration among students with autism.
Dr. Rozga received a B.A. in Psychology (2000) from the University of California Berkeley, and an M.S. (2002) and Ph.D. (2007) in Developmental Psychology from the University of California Los Angeles. She completed a two-year postdoctoral fellowship through the Center for Behavior Neuroscience at Georgia State University before joining the faculty at Georgia Tech in 2010. She is currently a Senior Research Scientist in the School of Interactive Computing, and is the Director of the Georgia Tech Child Study Lab.

School of Interactive Computing
Assistant Professor
https://sites.google.com/site/anqiwuresearch
Research Areas: machine learning, computational neuroscience
Biography
My research interest is to develop scientifically-motivated probabilistic modeling approaches for neural and behavior analyses, and scalable and efficient inference algorithms to fit the models. Specifically, my lab focuses on:
(i) Probabilistic modeling for neural latent discovery: We are interested in developing disentangled generative latent variable models to mine interpretable latent representations from neural populations. The modeling topics would involve various deep generative models, such as variational auto encoder, (deep) Gaussian process, Bayesian neural net, etc.
(ii) Behavior analysis and understanding: We aim at extracting multi-layer information from animal behaviors and allows neuro-behavior analysis for both motor functions and cognitive functions. The research direction will involve projects such as 3D full-body kinematic model estimation, developing hierarchical spatial and temporal models for animal behavior syllables, studying intrinsic motives and reward representations of animals via (inverse) reinforcement learning, etc.
(iii) Probabilistic modeling and efficient inference approaches for: Bayesian (convolutional) neural net, deep Gaussian process, Bayesian active learning and deep generative models, etc.

http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/
Research Areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning
Biography
Charles Isbell's research passion is artificial intelligence. In particular, he focuses on applying statistical machine learning to building autonomous agents that must live and interact with large numbers of other intelligent agents, some of whom may be human.
Lately, Isbell has turned his energies toward adaptive modeling, especially activity discovery (as distinct from activity recognition); scalable coordination; and development environments that support the rapid prototyping of adaptive agents. As a result, he has begun developing adaptive programming languages, worrying about issues of software engineering, and trying to understand what it means to bring machine learning tools to non-expert authors, designers, and developers.

Affiliations
School of Interactive Computing
Assistant Professor
Research Areas: Artificial Intelligence; Cognitive Systems; Cognitive and Learning Sciences; Human-Computer Interaction; Learning Technology.
Biography
Chris MacLellan is an Assistant Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology, where he leads the Teachable AI Lab (TAIL; https://tail.cc.gatech.edu). His work on cognitive systems aims to advance our understanding of how people teach and learn and to build AI systems that can teach and learn like people do and in ways that are compatible with people. He explores the development of computational models of learning and how these models can support the development of AI technologies, such as intelligent tutoring systems and medical decision support systems, at scale.
He also investigates how data collected about how people learn and make decisions can be leveraged to drive the development of better cognitive models and computational learning systems. Chris has been a principal investigator on multiple sponsored project awards with DARPA, the U.S. Army, ONR, and NSF. He has also received external recognition for his work, such as the 2022 EAAI Now and Future AI Educator award as well as being named on the 2021 Technical.ly RealLIST of technologists building Philadelphia’s future.
Prior to his position at Georgia Tech, Chris was an Assistant Professor of Information Science and Computer Science (by co-appointment) at Drexel University. Before that, he completed his PhD in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computing, where he was a fellow in the Program for Interdisciplinary Education Research (PIER).
The products of his work have immediate implications for AI-powered technology development. For example, through his work with the NSF-funded AI ALOE Institute, Chris is developing tools that let teachers build AI-powered tutors by naturally teaching an AI agent rather than programming. His work also has many broader implications, such as enabling doctors to support the development of AI-powered diagnoses tools where few training examples are available (DARPA-funded POCUS project) and for creating personal assistant agents that can engage in collaborative learning to support more effective human-machine teaming (ARL-funded STRONG project).
Associate Professor
Research Areas: Human-Centered Computing; Participatory Design; Digital Civics

Professor Emeritus
http://oue.gatech.edu/content/colin-potts
Research Areas: Professional ethics, Social implications of information technology, Requirements engineering, Design thinking
Biography
Dr. Colin Potts, the vice provost for undergraduate education oversees offices and programs affecting undergraduate education including the Center for Career Discovery and Development (C2D2), the Honors Program (HP), the Center for Academic Enrichment (CAE), Center for Academic Success (CAS), and the Center for Serve-Learn-Sustain (SLS).
Dr. Potts sits on the President’s Cabinet and represents Georgia Tech’s undergraduate academic affairs to the University System of Georgia Board of Regents and the Association of American Universities (AAU), among other constituencies. He also evaluates and approves academic policies affecting undergraduate students and proposals for all undergraduate courses and programs.
After earning a Ph.D. from Sheffield University in psychology for performing research in text memory and comprehension, and then working as a software engineer and ergonomics consultant, Potts joined the Department of Computing at Imperial College. Later, he moved to the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation as a senior technical staff member. Potts joined the Georgia Tech College of Computing in 1992 as a faculty member in what is now the School of Interactive Computing. His research over the past 25 years has spanned the fields of requirements engineering, software design methods, human-computer interaction and information privacy. All his research has been interdisciplinary and has emphasized the human element in technology design and use. Potts is best known for design methods that start not from technology innovation but from user needs and envisaged scenarios of use.
Potts has been responsible for designing and teaching courses in software engineering, human-computer interaction design and evaluation and the social and ethical implications of information technology. He has taught at the undergraduate, master’s and doctoral levels; professional development seminars; and evening courses. His passion, however, is undergraduate education- for which he received the 2010 William “Gus” Baird Faculty Teaching Award and the 2012 Eichholz Faculty Teaching Award. He frequently teaches introductory courses in computer science to non-majors.
He has taught in study abroad programs in Barcelona and Oxford, led a ThinkBig living learning community and participated in the development of the X-Degree and TechArts- initiatives that emerged from the institute’s 25-year strategic plan and seek to broaden the academic experiences of students.
Potts is a photographer with several one-man exhibits to his name and is a keen but rusty chess player (lifetime high of USCF 2050 but now languishing in the low 1800s). He was born in London, which explains his oddly spelled sense of humor and his lifelong support for Tottenham Hotspur FC. He is married to a professor and poet, has two cats and an adult son.

Biography
Dhruv Batra is an Associate Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech and a Research Director in the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team at Meta.
His research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and AI. The long-term goal of his research is to develop agents that “see” (or more generally perceive their environment through vision, audition, or other senses), “talk” (i.e. hold a natural language dialog grounded in their environment), “act” (e.g. navigate their environment and interact with it to accomplish goals), and “reason” (i.e., consider the long-term consequences of their actions).
He is a recipient of the 2019 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), the 2018 Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers by the US Army (ECASE-Army), the 2017 Office of Naval Research (ONR) Young Investigator Program (YIP) award, the 2014 National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award, the 2014 Army Research Office (ARO) Young Investigator Program (YIP) award, Outstanding Junior Faculty awards from Virginia Tech College of Engineering in 2015 and Georgia Tech College of Computing in 2018, multiple research awards from industry (Google, Amazon, Facebook), Carnegie Mellon Dean's Fellowship in 2007, and several best paper awards and nominations (CVPR 2022, ICCV 2019, EMNLP 2017, ICML workshop on Visualization for Deep Learning 2016, ICCV workshop Object Understanding for Interaction 2016) and teaching commendations at Virginia Tech. His research is supported by NSF, ARO, ARL, ONR, DARPA, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and NVIDIA.

Biography
I am originally from Dalian, China and I came from Emory University with B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science. I joined CSE and started to work in SLIM (Seismic Laboratory for Imaging and Modeling) group in 2019.
Advisor: Felix J. Herrmann
Professor
Research Areas: Robotics, Computer Vision
Biography
Dr. Dellaert does research in the areas of robotics and computer vision, which present some of the most exciting challenges to anyone interested in artificial intelligence. He is especially keen on Bayesian inference approaches to the difficult inverse problems that keep popping up in these areas. In many cases, exact solutions to these problems are intractable, and as such he is interested in examining whether Monte Carlo (sampling-based) approximations are applicable in those cases.
Since coming to Georgia Tech Dr. Dellaert has explored the theme of probabilistic, model-based reasoning paired with randomized approximation methods in three main research areas:
- Advanced sequential Monte Carlo methods
- Spatio-Temporal Reconstruction from Images
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

School of Computer Science
Professor and Fleming Chair Emeritus
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Jim.Foley/foley.html
Research Areas: Information Visualization; HCI
Biography
Jim Foley is a computing pioneer, innovative educator, and respected author.
A leading international figure in two major disciplines of computer science (graphics and human-computer interaction), Foley has received lifetime achievement awards in both fields from the Association for Computer Machinery’s special interest groups (SIGGRAPH in 1997 and SIGCHI in 2007). Foley was one of the computer graphics pioneers who went on to help establish HCI as a discipline.
Co-author of three books, he is the first author of what many consider the definitive text in computer graphics, Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics, which has sold 400,000 copies in 10 translations.
Foley arrived at the College of Computing in 1991 and founded the GVU Center. Five years later, U.S. News and World Report ranked the center No. 1 for graduate computer science work in graphics and user interaction.
Active in industry, Foley became director of MERL (Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory) in 1996 and then CEO and chairman of Mitsubishi Electric Information Technology Center America in 1998. He returned to Georgia in late 1999 to head up the state's Yamacraw economic development initiative in design of broadband systems, devices and chips.
For four years (2001-2005), Foley chaired the Computing Research Association (CRA), which represents more than 200 research universities, corporate research labs and professional societies.
In February 2008, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, among the highest professional distinctions given to an engineer. A few months later, he received the 2008 Class of 1934 Distinguished Professor Award, the highest honor Georgia Tech bestows on faculty. He is also a Fellow of ACM, IEEE and AAAS.
Of all his awards, Foley says he most treasures the one given him by computing graduate students who named him "Most Likely to Make Students Want to Grow Up to be Professors."
Foley served as interim dean of the College of Computing from 2008 to 2010.

Biography
Janet Kolodner's research has addressed issues in learning, memory, and problem solving, both in computers and in people. She pioneered the computer reasoning method called case-based reasoning, a way of solving problems based on analogies to past experiences, and her lab emphasized case-based reasoning for situations of real-world complexity. Her book, Case-Based Reasoning, synthesizes work across the field of case-based reasoning from its inception to 1993. The notion of a case-based design aid (CBDA), or an indexed library of design cases with the kinds of information in them that can help designers make design decisions, comes from her lab, which was the originator of the first CBDA, Archie-II, in collaboration with colleagues in architecture. She has also been a leader in articulating the cognitive model case-based reasoning implies and the applications and implications of case-based reasoning for education and creative problem solving. For the past decade, she has focused most of her research using the model to design science curriculum for middle school. The approach, called Learning by Design™ (LBD), is a design-based learning approach and an inquiry-oriented project-based approach to science learning. Students learn science and scientific reasoning in the context of designing working artifacts (e.g., a miniature vehicle). The challenge engages them and encourages curiosity, the want to succeed promotes a want to learn what's needed to succeed, and the design cycle, which interweaves design and investigation, engineering and scientific reasoning, learning and application, and doing and reflection, helps children identify what they need to learn, come to understand the science content and come to become well-versed in science practices. More recently, she and her students are applying what they've learned about design-based learning to informal education -- after-school programs, museum programs, and museum exhibits. The goal of these projects is to identify ways of helping pre-teens and young teens consider who they are as thinkers and to come to value informed decision making and informed production and consumption of evidence. In Kitchen Science Investigators, 5th and 6th graders are learning in the context of cooking. In Hovering Around, they are learning in the context of designing hovercraft.
Kolodner was founding Director of Georgia Tech's EduTech Institute, whose mission is to use what we know about cognition to inform the design of educational technology and learning environments. She served as coordinator of G eorgia Tech's cognitive science program for many years. Professor Kolodner is founding Editor in Chief of The Journal of the Learning Sciences, an interdisciplinary journal that focuses on learning and education. She is a founder of the International Society for the Learning Sciences, and she served as its first Executive
Officer.

Biography
Advisor: Le Song
I primarily work in the intersection of deep learning and logical reasoning for complex machine learning problems. These complex problems are typically multi-modal problems between computer vision and natural language, such as visual question answering. More specifically I investigate the label annotation and computational complexity for methods addressing these problems. I am also broadly interested in large scale structured prediction problems from biological, recommender, and financial systems.

Research Areas: Human-Computer Interaction
Biography
Dr. W. Keith Edwards is a Professor in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech and Director of the GVU Center. His research interests focus primarily on driving human-centered concerns into core computing infrastructure. For example, he is a pioneer in the exploration of human-centered perspectives on computer networking, particularly in the home; he has also been active in developing more usable approaches to information security systems. Lately, his research has expanded into a number of explorations of the social impacts of computing technology, and understanding how technology can support the work of non-profits and NGOs. While he is a technologist at heart, he enjoys working with designers, as well as ethnographers and other social scientists.
An ACM Distinguished Scientist, Dr. Edwards has published over 80 scientific articles in major journals, conferences, and books, as well as two books on Sun's Jini distributed computing technology. An active inventor, he is the author of nearly four dozen U.S. and International patents either granted or pending. His research has been widely funded by both industry and governmental sources, including Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, Samsung, Google, Symantec, Steelcase, Nokia, Dell, NSF, and NIST.
He is an active member of the broader academic community, having served as the Technical Program Chair for the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) 2010, the Program Chair for the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) 2002, the Chair for the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) 2000, and the Editorial Advisory board for the Journal of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (JCSCW), among other leadership roles. He has also served on dozens of program committees for major conferences in disciplines ranging from human-computer interaction to information security to mobile computing. Outside the university, he is a member of Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing Academic Advisory Board, and has been a consultant for several major companies including Sun, BellSouth Information Systems, NeXT Computer, and SecureWare.
Prior to his current appointment at Georgia Tech, Dr. Edwards was a Principal Scientist at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), where he worked for nearly ten years. During his time there he worked in PARC's Distributed Systems group on distributed information systems and weakly-consistent distributed databases; he later managed PARC's Ubiquitous Computing group, created and led the development of the Speakeasy framework for ubiquitous computing, and made key contributions to PARC's technology commercialization and licensing activities.

Biography
My research interest lies in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computational neuroscience. The primary focus is to develop mathematical/statistical models for learning meaningful patterns from big data i.e., neuroimaging, and genomics. The intuition is to aid in investigating the underlying mechanism of psychiatric disorders and explaining the disease-oriented deficits. Also, I am interested in designing novel summarization and multi-dimensional clustering algorithms to handle inherent heterogeneity in biological populations. Additionally, I am fascinated to engineer the brain's computational strategies to enhance SOTA AI.

Assistant Professor
Research Areas: Dynamical systems and ergodic theory; computational statistics; computational dynamics; machine learning theory
Biography
Nisha Chandramoorthy is an assistant professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech. Her research involves mathematical analyses and development of rigorous computational methods for better understanding and engineering nonlinear, possibly chaotic, dynamical systems. Some themes from her research are statistical response to perturbations, probability measure transport and high-dimensional Bayesian inference, and generalization of learning algorithms. These are motivated by fundamental scientific questions about nonlinearity as well as computational problems surrounding nonlinear systems. Both aims feed each other to improve our collective understanding of complex nonlinear processes, including in systems biology, climate studies and machine learning.
Prior to joining Georgia Tech, Nisha was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Data, Systems and Society at MIT. She received her Ph.D. and master’s degrees from MIT in 2021 and 2016 respectively, and her bachelor’s degree from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, in 2014.

Patrick Lavin
Ph.D. Student
Affiliations
School of Computational Science and Engineering
Vice President, Tech Operators
Biography
Patrick Taylor is an authority in the convergence of business analytics, information security and the implementation of technology to boost organizational performance. An innovator in his field, Patrick recognized that most IT-security and financial-system controls focus on user access and role management, but don't address how to convert ERP, CRM and other financial transaction resources into plain-language, actionable insights. This realization motivated Patrick to launch Oversight Systems, of which he is the current President & CEO. Oversight is unprecedented in its ability to use continuous transaction analysis in sync with predictive analytics to provide executives and business managers with clear, actionable insights from a sea of otherwise insurmountable data. Oversight Systems currently analyzes over $2 trillion of business transactions per year and continues to evolve its products and services to stay ahead of an ever-changing industry.
Previously, Patrick has held leading positions with many notable groups such as Internet Security Systems (ISS), Symantec, ORACLE, Red Brick Systems, GO, Air2Web and Fast-Talk. Patrick, an avid Jackets fan, holds a B.A. of Mechanical Engineering with Honors from Georgia Tech as well as an MBA from the Harvard Business School. He enjoys spending time with his wife, Margaret, and 5 children, one of which is currently a Georgia Tech undergrad.

Biography
Peter A. Freeman was the Founding Dean of the College of Computing in 1990 and served as the John P. Imlay Dean of Computing until 2002. From 2002 to 2007, he was Assistant Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), heading the Computer & Information Science & Engineering Directorate. He previously held positions at George Mason University, NSF, the University of California, Irvine, and Carnegie-Mellon.
Dr. Freeman is widely recognized for his technical and educational activities in software systems and software engineering, and computer science and information technology more generally. In addition to his academic and research activities, he is an experienced university and government executive and manager, and a seasoned lecturer and consultant to corporations, governments, and universities in more than a dozen countries.
At Georgia Tech, he led a group of about thirty faculty, annual research of less than $2M, and a few hundred students to a dynamic group of sixty-five faculty, annual research well in excess of $10M, and almost 2000 students. Several of the research groups in the College became acknowledged national leaders in fields ranging from theory to HCI. The foundation created under his leadership has permitted the College of Computing to become a top-ten ranked unit with outstanding education and research innovation and disciplinary leadership.
As an Assistant Director of NSF he was part of the senior management team that helped formulate national science policy and that operated the NSF. As AD/CISE, he oversaw a staff of approximately 100 and a funding budget of over $500M/year. He was also responsible for insuring that the U.S. computing research community was well connected internationally. During his time as AD/CISE, Dr. Freeman was responsible for a number of activities that continue to have a major impact on computing, including the Information Technology Research Program, cyberinfrastructure initiatives, the GENI Internet Research project, Broadening Participation in Computing, and the Computing Community Consortium.
He has focused his attention for over twenty-five years on national policy and local action intended to advance science and engineering research and education. For almost forty years, he has been active internationally –– teaching, lecturing, and consulting domestically and overseas. He began his research career fifty years ago and held his first computing job in 1961.
Dr. Freeman is a Fellow of ACM, IEEE, and AAAS. He received his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie-Mellon University (1970), his M.A. in mathematics and psychology from University of Texas at Austin (1965), and his B.A. in physics and mathematics from Rice University (1963).
He is a resident of Washington, DC.

Regents' Professor Emeritus
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~fujimoto
Research Areas: Parallel discrete event simulation, distributed simulation, applications in sustainability, transportation
Biography
Dr. Richard Fujimoto is a Regents’ Professor, Emeritus, in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He received the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1983 in Computer Science and Engineering. He also received an M.S. degree from the same institution two years earlier as well as two B.S degrees from the University of Illinois, Urbana.
Fujimoto is a pioneer in the parallel and distributed discrete event simulation field. Discrete event simulation is widely used in areas such as telecommunications, transportation, manufacturing, and defense, among others. His work developed fundamental understandings of synchronization algorithms that are needed to ensure the correct execution of discrete event simulation programs on high performance computing (HPC) platforms. His team developed many new algorithms and computational techniques to accelerate the execution of discrete event simulations and developed software realizations that impacted several application domains. For example, his Georgia Tech Time Warp software was deployed by MITRE Corp. to create online fast-time simulations of commercial air traffic to help reduce delays in the U.S. National Airspace. An active researcher in this field since 1985, he authored or co-authored three books and hundreds of technical papers including seven that were cited for “best paper” awards or other recognitions. His research included several projects with Georgia Tech faculty in telecommunications, transportation, sustainability, and materials leading to numerous publications co-authored with faculty across campus.
Fujimoto led the definition of the time management services in the High Level Architecture (HLA) for Modeling and Simulation that ensure proper synchronization of distributed simulations. HLA was designated as the standard technical architecture for all modeling and simulation in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in 1996, thereby forming the basis for simulation interoperability across the entire DoD. Standardized as IEEE 1516, it continues to be used to this day. Software implementations of the services he developed have been realized by corporations such as CAE, General Dynamics, Mitsubishi, Raytheon, Pitch and Mak, among others, as well as an HPC version developed by his group at Georgia Tech. He received the ACM SIGSIM Distinguished Contributions in Simulation Award and the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education (I/ITSEC) Fellow Award in recognition of his contributions to the field. He is a fellow of the ACM, IEEE, and SCS.
At Georgia Tech Fujimoto was the founding chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) from 2005 to 2014. In that role he was the architect of interdisciplinary educational programs bridging the College of Computing with the rest of campus, especially the College of Engineering and the College of Sciences. He led the creation of the M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs in CSE that span numerous schools across campus. He led the creation of the College of Computing’s first on-line distance learning degree program, the M.S. program in CSE. At the undergraduate level he led the Computational-X initiative that resulted in the creation of two new undergraduate minors for students outside the College of Computing. He contributed to the development of Georgia Tech’s M.S. program in Analytics as well as its M.S. program in Urban Analytics, again with faculty in several other units across campus. A strong advocate for diversity, he played a leading role in the creation of the CRUISE (Computing Research Undergraduate Intern Summer Experience) program featuring outreach to women and minority students, personally supervised numerous African-American undergraduates, and served as the advisor for the first African-American student to receive the Ph. D. degree from Georgia Tech’s CSE program. As CSE school chair his accomplishments include growing the school to 13 tenure track faculty and building the school’s administrative staff. Under his leadership, the school was formally established as an academic unit (the School of Computational Science and Engineering) at Georgia Tech in 2010. He received many Georgia Tech awards including the institute-wide Class of 1934 Outstanding Interdisciplinary Activities Award, the Outstanding Service Award, and the Outstanding Achievement in Research Program Development Award as well as numerous College of Computing awards.

Research Areas: Compiler Analysis and Optimizations
Biography
Santosh Pande’s area of research is compiler analysis and optimizations which provide deep insights into the intricate behaviors of software and such insights are invaluable to improve multitudes of software systems properties in a highly automated manner. He has done work both on static as well as runtime analysis that tracks emergent program properties, the end result being optimizations as well as tracking the security properties during execution. Some of the highlights of his past research involve: (a) solving the challenging problem of operating system-less scheduling on very high performance throughput oriented (network) processor (Embedded Systems), (b) exposing a key vulnerability in XOM secure processor through a side channel attack and proposing a practical fix for it (Hardware Security) and (c) developing a systematic framework to understand the soft real time properties of modern (interactive) software converting an art into science and (4) utilizing algorithmic properties of software to produce highly scalable performance for computationally intense SAT solvers which are extremely demanding in terms of performance but can not be parallelized. He is applying this work currently to many ML algorithms. His work is disseminated through 100+ papers, open source software and has been consistently funded by NSF and is supported by ONR, DARPA and many companies.

He was the Huebner Chair in Education and Technology at the University of Minnesota before coming to Georgia Tech.
Dr. Varma is a cognitive scientist who uses computational modeling and behavioral experiments to investigate those complex forms of cognition that are uniquely human, and indeed make us human. His primary line of research is in mathematical and computational thinking, where he investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying our ability to understand abstract mathematical concepts (e.g., in geometry and topology) and to reason about computationally hard problems (e.g., the travelling salesperson problem). His work on problem solving and language understanding is characterized by the development of computational models and, increasingly, the use of machine learning techniques.

Taeheon Kim
Ph.D. Student
tkim@gatech.edu
Affiliations
School of Interactive Computing
Professor and Director of GTS3
Research Areas: Systems Security, Operating Systems, Programming Languages, and Distributed Systems.
Biography
Kim is interested in building computing systems where underlying principles justify why it should be secure. Those principles include the design of the system, analysis of its implementation, and clear separation of trusted components. Kim seeks to develop tools that automatically identify which parts of an operating system have been affected, allowing a system administrator to recover from cyberattacks without excessive, manual effort.
Since arriving at Georgia Tech, Kim has secured numerous reseach grants from the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), among others. He continues to earn numerous honors such as the 2015 Internet Defense Prize from USENIX and Facebook, and he competed as a finalist in the inaugural DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge with Team Disekt.
Kim finished his doctorate in 2014 at MIT, where he worked with professors Nickolai Zeldovich and Frans Kaashoek specializing in systems security. His thesis work focused on detecting and recovering from attacks on computer systems. Kim has developed tools that would detect intrusion and discover which parts of the operating system could have been affected, allowing a systems administrator to recover from an attack without excessive manual effort. Kim received his bachelor’s in both computer science and electrical engineering from KAIST in 2009, and his SM and PhD from MIT in 2011 and 2014.

Ph.D. CS Human-Computer Interaction Body of Knowldege
Note: This is the list for students in the computer science PhD program. HCC PhD students, please study the HCC qualifier reading list.
The purpose of this document is to provide information to students preparing for the HCI Area Qualifier in the College of Computing. This body of knowledge document is fairly lengthy. It is not meant to intimidate, rather it is intended to give as much insight into what defines the fairly broad research agenda of HCI. It is also intended as advice on how to best prepare to become a mature researcher in HCI.
Relevant Courses
Students should take HCI-related graduate courses from our curriculum. All students should take:
- CS 6750: Human-Computer Interaction
This course is offered every semester. It is the fundamental introductory course to the area. Two textbooks are standard reading in this course:
- Dix, A., J. Finlay, G. Abowd and R. Beale. (1997) Human-Computer Interaction, 2nd edition. Prentice-Hall International. 3rd edition due out in early 2004.
- Norman, D.A. (1990) The Design of Everyday Things Doubleday.
Students are also advised to consider taking the following course:
- CS 6455: User Interface Design and Evaluation
This course is usually offered during the Spring. Together, CS 6750 and 6455 constitute material in the core area of HCI and are represented in the Design Process and Theory section of the Qualifying Exam.
Other, more focused upper-level courses listed below also may help students gain knowledge in particular subareas of HCI:
- CS 6456: Principles of User Interface Software
- CS 6470: Design of On-Line Communities
- CS 7450: Information Visualization
- CS 7460: Collaborative Computing
- CS 7470: Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing
While we do not require students to take any of these courses, it is expected that any student taking the HCI Qualifying Exam will be familiar with material in two of four specialization areas, described below. Much, but not all, of the material for a specialization area is covered in these courses, so students should at least be familiar with the readings for selected specialization areas.
General Literature
Students should supplement their understanding of fundamental HCI knowledge through familiarity with any comprehensive text in the field, such as Human-Computer Interaction, 2nd edition by Dix, Finlay, Abowd and Beale, Human-Computer Interaction by Preece, Rogers, Sharp, Benyon, Hollan and Carey or Designing the User Interface by Shneiderman.
Students can gain knowledge that will be beneficial on the Qualifier Exam through familiarity with recent research papers in pertinent HCI-related academic conferences such as ACM-sponsored SIGCHI and UIST conferences. We encourage students to review recent proceedings of these conferences and to attend the conferences themselves when possible. For students doing research in a specialized area of HCI, such as CSCW, Information Visualization, Augmented Reality, Wearable Computing or Ubiquitous Computing, you should also be familiar with recent proceedings from specialized conferences. To facilitate familiarity with recent research publications in HCI, in some semesters we offer a weekly reading seminar for discussing papers with students and faculty. Students should regularly attend this seminar when it is offered.
There are also several important general journals in this field, such as ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (ToCHI) the HCI Journal, and The International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, as well as more specialized journals for sub topics of HCI. As a general rule, a student at the qualifier level should know which of these archival resources to consult to explore any HCI-relevant topic for further information. This includes searching on-line resources, such as the ACM Digital Library, the IEEE Computer Society Digital Library and the HCI Bibliography.
The HCI Qualifier: What are we looking for?
Overall, we seek that students gain a deep understanding of the fundamental research paradigms and thrusts of our discipline. We seek thoughtful, thorough responses to questions on the exam that show a student is familiar with past related research, is able to analyze a problem and identify key issues therein, and is able to speculate on future directions. Being able to compare approaches, discuss advantages and disadvantages of tactics, and make critical judgments about the applicability of research methods is key to positive performance on the written exam. Being able to demonstrate that one's own initial research in the HCI area is informed by a deep understanding of the HCI research paradigm(s) is also important for the oral portion of the qualifier, as demonstrated by publishable quality work and a prepared presentation.
Research Themes in HCI
The Qualifying Exam is divided into two major section: Design Process and Theory and Special Topics. Students will be expected to answer questions in the Design Process and Theory portion of the exam. Students are also expected to select two Special Topics for which they will answer questions on the exam. Below is a further breakdown of these major sections, with links providing overviews and pointers for further reading.
Design Process and Theory
These topics permeate all research in HCI and, as a result are areas that should be well understood by all students preparing for the HCI Qualifier
Special Topics
These themes are important subsets of HCI research in the College of Computing. We expect each student preparing for the HCI Qualifier to be expert in at least one of these specialized areas.
- Learning Science and Technology
- User Interface Software and Technology
- Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)
- Information Visualization
- Ubiquitous Computing
Beyond the methods listed above to gain background knowledge of the discipline, we encourage students to form reading/discussion groups to help familiarize themselves with the research literature of HCI. Furthermore, we encourage students to become involved in the research groups and group meetings that are pertinent to their own personal research interests. This can help a student gain a deep understanding of a particular area, which is beneficial on the Qualifying Exam.

Intelligent Systems Qualifier Exam
1. Qualifier Process
The qualifier takes place over the course of 2 weeks and consists of related written and oral components. In addition, the student will prepare a portfolio consisting of a short description of research accomplishments to date and at least one research paper of publishable quality.
The examination aims to evaluate the student’s understanding of their research area, as well as their broader understanding of the field. The evaluation is conducted by a Qualifier Committee consisting of four faculty: the student’s advisor and three other IC faculty.
The student will pick two areas from the following list:
-
Robotics
-
Perception
-
Machine Learning
-
Planning and Search
-
Cognitive Science
-
Knowledge Based AI
-
Ubiquitous Computing
-
Natural Language Processing
-
Artificial Intelligence
Committees will consist of 4 members:
-
Advisor (non-voting)
-
2 voting members selected by student (in consultation with the advisor), each representing an area.
-
1 voting member not selected by student (but from IS faculty)
The advisor and two voting members selected by the student will generate one qualifier question each (for a total of three questions). The advisor’s question will focus on one of the research topics the student is engaged in. The questions of the other faculty members will cover the areas selected by the student. Upon receiving the questions, the student will have two weeks to produce a written response to the questions. The written response must be no longer than 2000 words per question and must be submitted by the end of the 2 week period. After the written exam period, the student will prepare an oral presentation of their research to date.
2. Timing
The student selects the week he or she wishes his or her written exam to start. Prior to that date, the student selects two areas and two committee members, one representing each area. The advisor selects the third voting member. One week prior to the written exam date, the two area committee members and the advisor write questions. Each of the four committee members must agree upon the set of questions for the student.
The student will have two weeks from the start of the written exam to answer the questions. The student should work on the questions independently. To do otherwise will be considered a violation of the Student Honor Code. Answers to questions are returned to the committee within the two week period.
The student works with the committee to schedule an oral research presentation.
3. Suggested Preparation:
There are no required courses for the qualifier, however the faculty recommend that students take the following courses associated with their chosen qualifier areas:

Example Qual Questions:
Each question should start with a list of at least 3 papers the student will read. The questions will draw from a subset of the readings as well as course material.
Question:
Readings:
“Visual Question Answering” (Antol et al. ICCV 2015).
"Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Insights and Applications" paper of Gal and Ghahramani (2015)
[Plus one other]
In Visual Question Answering (VQA), an agent is tasked with answering a natural language question about an image. Given the interactive nature of VQA, it is natural to consider a flipped scenario where an agent is asking questions about images to learn more about the visual world.
(1) Consider the baseline LSTM + CNN model from “Visual Question Answering” (Antol et al. ICCV 2015). Propose a basic active learning setup for this model.
(2) Read the "Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: Insights and Applications" paper of Gal and Ghahramani (2015). Use their approach to design an active learning strategy for the LSTM + CNN VQA model.
(3) Describe the pros and cons of the above two active learning approaches.

Ph.D. CS Program of Study
The Computer Science PhD program is divided up into a series of milestones which every student progresses through on the way to the degree.
CS 7001: Introduction to Graduate Studies
During students' first semester at the College, they are expected to enroll in CS7001, Introduction to Graduate Studies. This course helps prepare students for research in computer science, and provides an introduction to the various research areas in the College.
Research Credit
Research with a faculty member is an essential aspect of the Computer Science Ph.D. Newly admitted students are expected to work on one or more jointly-defined research projects with faculty members in the College. While one goal of this is for the student to gain practical experience in doing research, these semester-long projects also serve as a way for students and faculty to begin to explore potential advisor relationships.
Before students have a formal advisor, they are expected to register for CS 8903, Special Problems in Computer Science, under the supervision of a faculty member in the College. Registration for this course is restricted, and requires that students and the supervising faculty member complete a form describing the research to be completed over the course of the semester. Students may occasionally participate in multiple 8903 research projects in any given semester, given time and other commitments, and may participate in 8903 research projects for several semesters until they have a formal research advisor.
Once students have a formal advisor, they are expected to focus on what will become their dissertation research under the supervision of their advisor. At this stage, students will register for CS 8999, Doctoral Thesis Preparation. Students and their advisor must fill out the CS 8999 permit form that indicates the general research direction and that confirms the establishment of the advisory relationship. This form only needs to be filled out one time.
Breadth Component
After admission, a student begins to work on fulfilling the breadth requirement. The breadth component of the program is intended to give students a view into a variety of areas within computing. Each student must take classes in 5 of the 15 areas of computer science. The 15 areas are:
- Computational Science and Engineering
- Computer Architecture
- Database Systems
- Graphics and Visualization
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Information Security
- Intelligent Systems (including Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, and Robotics)
- Learning Sciences and Technology
- Machine Learning
- Networking and Communications
- Programming Languages and Compilers
- Social Computing
- Software Methodology and Engineering
- Systems (Including Operating Systems, and Distributed and Parallel Processing)
- Theoretical Computer Science
Of the five different courses, one must be from the Theory area. Students must earn an A or B in all of these courses, and more As than Bs total.
Students who have taken graduate level courses elsewhere before entering the program can petition to have those classes count towards filling the breadth requirement.
Programming Proficiency Requirement
In addition, each student must complete a Programming Proficiency requirement. A single class may satisfy both the Programming Proficiency requirement and a Breadth area requirement. The Programming Proficiency requirement must be fulfilled at Georgia Tech and may not be satisfied by transfer credit or advanced standing.
The courses that can satisfy the Programming Proficiency Requirement are:
- CS 6210 Advanced Operating Systems
- CS 6241 Design and Implementation of Compilers
- CS 6290 High-Performance Computer Architecture
- CS 6476 Computer Vision
- CS 7490 Advanced Image Synthesis
- CS 7492 Simulation of Biology
- CS 7637 Knowledge-Based AI
- CS 7643 Deep Learning
- CS 7646 Machine Learning for Trading
- CS 7650 Natural Language

Minor
The minor is a sequence of non-College of Computing courses with a coherent theme, totaling 9 credit hours. These courses should have a subject designator OTHER than "CS/CSE" as reported on your transcript. Their theme should somehow relate to the subject of the student's thesis and research.
The classes must be taken for a letter grade, with at least a "B" average. Courses should be at the graduate level, but one approved 4000-level course may be used. No more than three of the hours may be directed research.
After completing all the minor classes, download and fill out the Minor form.
Qualifying Exam
As a student's research progresses, he or she must select a primary, and possibly secondary, area of focus from the areas of research in the College and then pass a Qualifier in that area or areas. The Qualifier is a student's first step toward achieving candidacy in the doctoral program. This Qualifier functions as Georgia Tech's Comprehensive Examination. Click here to view the list of areas of research in the College identified for the Qualifier and Breadth Requirements.
The Exam Committee
The student must identify a research advisor and an exam committee of at least three other faculty from the area to oversee the Qualifier.
Results
- The exam committee is responsible for determining if a student has passed the Qualifier. The results of the Qualifier will be communicated to the school graduate coordinators by the respective area advisor. The student should fill out the Qualifier Form after passing the Exam.
- Each student is allowed two opportunities to pass both the area knowledge and creativity components of the examination. The two components are treated independently, so a student need not pass both at the same time. Students who are not able to pass the Qualifier after two attempts will be encouraged to seek a Master's degree, and they will not be able to continue in the doctoral program.
- After successfully completing the Qualifier, student focuses on research leading toward a dissertation. Students should register for doctoral dissertation hours (CS 9000) after passing the Qualifier rather than registering for Special Problems (CS 8903).
-
The topic of the student's research is formalized through both a written dissertation proposal and an oral presentation.
Create a Research Portfolio
In consultation with your advisor and the committee, assemble a research portfolio before the oral exam. The nature of the portfolio is decided by the committee. The portfolio shall be handed over to the exam committee at least one week prior to the oral exam.
Schedule the Oral Exam
Schedule an oral exam in consultation with the committee. The oral exam should preferably be held before the end of the semester. The oral exam date and the names of the exam committee members should be communicated to the PhD Program Coordinator in your school.
Thesis Proposal
The PhD. proposal consists of:
- A proposal document written by the student in which he/she will propose the research work to be undertaken as part of his/her doctoral work and a schedule for completion
- An oral defense of the proposal document
Committee
PhD. proposal will be administered by the student's thesis advisory committee (the advisor plus at least two other faculty members), chosen jointly by the student and the advisor. A majority of the members of the advisory committee must hold their primary appointments on the College of Computing faculty. It is a good practice to have all members (including the external committee member) of your dissertation defense committee in your proposal committee.
Proposal Announcement
The proposal must be announced publicly to the College at least one week prior to the date of the oral defense. Please provide a copy of the announcement to the PhD Program Coordinator in your school.
Format
There is no fixed format for the oral defense. The advisor, as the chair of the committee, conducts the examination. Here is a typical way in which it may be run:
- The student will make a presentation to the committee and others present.
- After the presentation there is a question and answer period. The chair then asks everyone other than the committee members and Georgia Tech faculty to leave. The committee members then have an opportunity to ask more questions. Then the student is asked to leave.
- The committee deliberates and then decides whether the student has passed the proposal defense. They give feedback to the student on the proposal either individually or through the advisor.
A student must have passed the qualifying examination to do a PhD. proposal. A student who has passed the proposal defense and has also completed all course requirements (except the minor), maintaining a satisfactory scholastic record, has achieved PhD. candidacy and should submit the Candidacy form.
Dissertation Defense
Before the announcement of the public PhD. dissertation defense, your advisor must approve that the dissertation is ready to be given to the dissertation committee, and the dissertation committee must approve that the dissertation is ready for the public dissertation defense. Before giving this approval, the entire committee is expected to have read the dissertation and to have given comments to the student. The committee must approve that a substantial and defensible portion of the dissertation has been completed. Three (3) weeks is a reasonable amount of time for reading the dissertation.
After the approval, the candidate’s academic department must announce the public dissertation defense at least fifteen (15) days in advance, and it must forward this announcement together with the names of the dissertation committee to the Office of Graduate Studies and Research.
The public dissertation defense starts with a presentation by the candidate and is followed by a question-answer period. The advisor, who is the chair of the committee, determines who may ask questions and in which order and brings the discussion to a close at the appropriate time. The question-answer period is followed by a closed-door session attended by only the members of the PhD. dissertation committee and interested Georgia Tech faculty.
The dissertation committee must take one of the following actions:
- To approve the dissertation without corrections.
- To approve the dissertation with minor corrections, to be approved by the advisor only.
- To require a resubmission with major changes and re-approval by the entire committee.
- Not to approve the dissertation.
The dissertation committee may recommend one additional defense if the dissertation is resubmitted with major changes or if the dissertation is not approved.
The candidate must make any corrections deemed necessary by the dissertation committee and the committee must sign the dissertation approval form after the dissertation has been approved. The format of the dissertation must meet the published institute guidelines.
The candidate must submit the dissertation and the signed dissertation approval form to the Georgia Institute of Technology Office Graduate Studies and Research by the deadline published by the Institute. The deadline is typically 12-14 days before last day of classes. Check the official school calendar.
Committee
As mentioned above, your advisor is the chair of your dissertation defense committee. Your committee should be formed of at least five people. At least one faculty member must be from outside CoC (from another unit at Tech or an outsider, and should have a Ph.D.), but the majority must have some CoC faculty appointment.
Note: You only need to have three people on your committee at the time of your proposal, but it is recommended that you have all five members at that time. All members of your committee should be present for the defense; however, in hardship cases, measures such as conference calls can be used as well.
Advertising the defense
The Graduate Studies office asks that you post an announcement of the defense to the git.cc.general and git.announce newsgroups. This should be done at least fifteen (15) working days prior to the defense. The announcement should consist of the day/time/place of the defense, title, abstract, and a list of the committee members. Please provide an electronic copy of this announcement to the PhD Program Coordinator in your school so that s/he may forward it to the GT Graduate Studies department.
Ph.D. CS Programming Languages & Compilers Body of Knowledge
A student has to take three courses as specified below and get an A in all the three courses.
Three out of the following five courses based on the student’s area and the advisor's recommendation:
CS 6241: Compiler Design
CS 6340: Software Analysis & Test
CS 6390: Programming Languages
CS 6301: Advanced Topics in Software Engineering
CS 6245: Parallelizing Compilers
Ph.D. CS Qualifier Exam Information
The Qualifier is designed to test whether PhD students are sufficiently prepared to do research in their chosen area(s) and whether they are engaged in research in their chosen area(s). Students are expected to take qualifier in their second year unless there are truly exceptional circumstances.
The Qualifier consists of three parts:
1. Testing the students' depth of knowledge in their chosen research area. The area-specific requirements for this part are listed below. Each item in the list is a link to a page summarizing the material students should know in order to have a deep understanding of the area and to prepare for the exam. This material may include courses, books, and articles.
2. The submission of a high-quality research deliverable, as evidenced by a portfolio consisting of an exam-committee-reviewed and publishable article, and possibly other work products as approved by the exam committee. This component evaluates the students' creative and research abilities, along with the potential to do dissertation research.
3. An oral presentation and examination that also allows for follow-up on the first two parts.

Qualifying Exam
All HCC Ph.D. students are required to take a qualifying exam. The purpose of the qualifying exam is for the student to demonstrate competency in:
- Basic computing concepts and methods
- Written research communication
- Oral research communication
- Core HCC Knowledge
- Core knowledge in student’s HCC specialization.
- Design and evaluation of human-centered systems
- Synthesis of ideas from different fields, such as from computing and cognitive, educational, and social sciences
Parts of the Exam
The qualifying exam consists of three parts:
- Written Exam
- Oral Exam
- Research Portfolio (demonstrates the skills enumerated below, and includes at least one publication quality paper)
*The HCC qualifying exam is administered in the spring term of each academic year and all students are expected to take it in their second year. Students that need accommodations must contact the Office of Disabilities Services. The exam is administered by a faculty committee selected by the advisor in consultation with the student. It consists of the student’s advisor(s) and three additional HCC faculty members. The HCC faculty will evaluate the written component of the qualifying exam and will decide whether or not the student is invited to complete the oral component. A student may retake a failed exam once and all students must pass within three years of entering the program.
After a second attempt of the written component of the qualifying exam the HCC faculty will decide whether or not the student is invited to complete the oral component. A student who fails the second qualifying exam will be asked to leave the program. The collective decision of the faculty is final.
Thesis Proposal Defense and Dissertation Defense
Georgia Tech requires that "Doctoral students must spend at least two full-time semesters in residence at the Georgia Institute of Technology and ordinarily must complete research for the dissertation while in residence" (Georgia Tech 2014-15 General Catalog).
- Thesis Proposal Defense - All students need to present and defend a written Ph.D. proposal to a thesis proposal committee of at least four members as follows:
- The student’s advisor(s)
- At least two additional HCC faculty members
- At least one other faculty from another academic unit in Georgia Tech (outside HCC, typically the minor field) or a committee member external to Georgia Tech
All committee members must have a Ph.D. degree. Committee members external to Georgia Tech need not be affiliated with a university.
We expect all students to defend their thesis proposal by the end of the fourth year of their Ph.D. program. After the proposal is accepted, the student is expected to initiate a meeting with the thesis committee at least once a year to review research progress.
When completed, the dissertation must be publicly defended before a dissertation committee of at least five members (in addition to the four above, at least one committee member must be external to Georgia Tech). Please see Georgia Tech Guidelines for thesis proposals.
Posting Internships & Jobs
Creating a Handshake Account
Click here for instructions on how to set up an employer account.
Click here for instructions on how to connect with various schools.
Your Handshake employer account will allow you to post job and internship opportunities, recruit both on-campus and on-line students, and conduct your own resume referral searches in the Georgia Tech College of Computing.
The College of Computing is the only unit at Georgia Tech using Handshake, so employers are reviewed based on the following criteria: Major specific (see Computing majors here), website verification, full company description, company contact with company email domain, and a known history of hiring for computing roles (internal/external to Handshake).
CareerBuzz is a free service that allows employers and third-party recruiters to post opportunities for all majors at Georgia Tech, including recent alumni within two years of graduation. CareerBuzz is a university-wide job board utilized by the GT Career Center the central career center at Georgia Tech. The College of Computing recommends posting opportunities to both platforms.
Internships
Internship Approval Conditions: Internships must meet the definition and criteria established for internships by NACE.
Additional Criteria Used to Evaluate Postings: The NACE definition provides a framework for college career centers to use in identifying legitimate internship experiences. As such, the College of Computing has determined the following criteria when deciding whether or not we will allow internships and job opportunities to be posted to our system in order to recruit students and recent grads from the College of Computing:
-
Internships for Credit: In most instances, students doing internships for academic credit will be required to set goals for the work term within the first three weeks of the semester, complete a work report, along with a performance evaluation at the end of the semester to quantify and give evidence of the internship experience. Make sure you are giving interns substantive work so they can fulfill the course requirements and earn the academic credit for which they paid. Most internship programs require students to complete at least 150 hours of work over the course of a semester; approximately 10‐15 hours per week during fall and spring semester and 15‐20 hours per week during the shorter summer semester. Internship start and end dates should coincide very closely with the start and end of the semester during which the student is receiving the academic credit, especially for F-1 students. In our college, internship credit is not awarded retroactively and we do not allow students to do summer internships and register to receive the credit in the following fall semester.
-
Recruiting Guidelines & Policies: As part of the University’s commitment to leadership in the area of ethics and professional conduct, we require employers utilizing College of Computing Career Services to adhere to employment laws and principles of professional practice, as outlined by the federal government and The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Principles for Professional Practice, respectively.
-
Unpaid Internship Guidelines: Interns should not be subjected to sexual harassment or other conditions that would constitute a hostile work environment. Treat interns with the same respect given to regular employees and offer them similar workplace protection. Employers must provide physical space in a professional work environment where the intern can complete his/her assigned tasks in close proximity to his/her direct supervisor. In‐home labs and offices, therefore, will not be approved. If you wish to take on unpaid interns, do not expect them to bring their own tools. Provide them the necessary equipment and tools to perform their job duties. Remember, if you are not paying them they are actually paying to work for you. Do not make it cost them anymore than necessary. Interns, particularly unpaid interns, should be supervised by experienced professionals. Computing interns should be supervised by computationalists. The supervisor should be on‐site, physically present, and accessible to the intern on a regular basis. How else will that supervisor be able to evaluate the intern’s performance, train and coach the intern, offer feedback and input and otherwise be a resource to the intern? They can’t.
-
Part-time Employment: Our students need part-time jobs too! These opportunities must be paid if posting to Handshake in the College of Computing. While internships must meet the NACE Internship Definition and Criteria and should be applied learning experience, therefore eligible for academic credit, part-time jobs do not. As such, please indicate the type of role accordingly in your job posting to avoid denial of your job posting.
Third Party Recruiters
Third party recruiters and staffing agencies are denied access to Handshake and the Career Fairs organized by the College of Computing.
CareerBuzz may be utilized as an alternative for third party postings at Georgia Tech. If you are a third-party recruiter posting a job for a client, it will be necessary to disclose the client name for whom you are recruiting in the job description box on CareerBuzz. All job posting requests from third-party recruiters without the client name will receive an email requesting that information. If an update to the job posting is not made within 48 hours of receiving the email request then the job positing will be deleted from the CareerBuzz system.
Third-party recruiters are eligible to participate in the All Majors Career Fair ONLY IF they are recruiting for their own respective organization OR they explicitly state the company they are representing at the time of registration and during the fair. The recruiting complexities that exist for a third-party recruiter far surpass those of a typical employer. Therefore, the GT Career Center reserves the right to deny access and participation to any third-party employer.
Compensation: Full‐time, internships, or part-time positions for the College of Computing current students can be paid or unpaid. Roles that have a base salary in addition to some form of commission structure are appropriate as long as the positions offer the salary component for at least one year of employment.
Position Type: All jobs and internships posted must be career-related/professionally oriented and require candidates pursuing or already possessing a university degree.
Communicating Outcomes: Students are eager to learn about recruiting outcomes, whether positive or negative. Please keep him/her advised of the interview outcome as soon as possible. If you are conducting interviews using a “pre‐select” process, please be sure to convert all students from “requested” to the appropriate status in Handshake: “accepted”, “not accepted”, or alternate”.
Work Authorization Policy: Due to guidelines issued by the Department of Justice, the default for all job postings will allow all applicants to apply, regardless of work authorization status. The only way we will restrict your posting is if you as the employer clearly states that citizenship is required by law, government contract, or executive order from the government. The Department of Justice “prohibits any posting that requires U.S. Citizenship or lawful permanent residence in the U.S. as a condition of employment, unless otherwise required in order to comply with law, regulation, executive order, or government contract.” We encourage you to read more about this regulation at The Department of Justice’s website: http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/osc/htm/best_practices.php.
Alcohol: Serving alcohol should not be part of the recruitment process. This includes any employer-related functions held on or off campus.

School of Computer Science
Let’s tackle this question with an example. Today you can ask your smartphone almost any question and get a quick response. “Computer science” is what happens behind the scenes: Your phone (already more powerful than any computer in existence 30 years ago) typically passes your query over a wireless-then-wired network to “the cloud,” which is really just clusters of machines, usually located near cheap or renewable energy sources.
Powerful algorithms then spread searches on sophisticated databases across many specially designed computers, coordinated by optimized system software, to discover the answers to your queries before returning the answer to your phone—often while you are still typing—while keeping your information secure and private.
That is computer science, in two-tenths of a second.
Georgia Tech’s School of Computer Science is home to a group of faculty and researchers with breadth and strength in all aspects of the computational process—from the algorithms to the architecture, from security to networking, from system design to the programming environments to databases.

Graduate Registration Information
Summer 2023 Registration
The schedule is subject to change at any time. Students should refer to OSCAR for the most up to date information.
There is NO permit survey for Summer. Students can register for any CS/CSE class that has open availability on their assigned campus.
REVISED: Major restrictions will remain in place for Summer 2023 until noon on Monday, April 24.
**You must limit your course search to “Georgia Tech-Atlanta” campus, so you aren’t seeing classes for which you are unable to register. Do not choose any sections that begin with “O”. **
Permit Forms
We will be using DocuSign for all paper permit forms during this phase of registration. Please click here for DocuSign instructions.
The form will be routed automatically to other recipients to review and sign. Once competed, all recipients receive the signed and completed form via email. You can check the progress of the form in your DocuSign account.
Please note that no academic credit will be given to grad students for 1000, 2000, or 3000 level courses. For 4000 level courses, please check your academic program’s rules to see if they will count for you.
Undergraduate BSMS Student Permits
Permits will be processed by both CoC and Registrar only if you are a senior by hours at the time of registration.
Please limit the number of permit requests to a maximum of 4 courses.
Summer Registration ends promptly at 4PM EDT on Friday, May 19.
Fall 2023 Phase I Registration
The schedule is subject to change at any time. Students should refer to OSCAR for the most up to date information.
In order to prevent the course hoarding behavior that causes many students not to be able to get into classes during Phase I, and creates great stress for students with later time tickets, we will be using the following procedure for registration:
All CS/CSE graduate courses will be PERMIT RESTRICTED for the ENTIRETY of Phase I registration.
We will send out a survey link on Wednesday, 3/22/23, where students can request permits. This survey link will remain open until 9AM EDT on Friday, 3/31/23. If you miss the survey deadline, you must contact Becky Wilson to request your permits via email. Late submissions will not be issued until after registration has started, so it is to your benefit to submit the survey prior to the deadline.
PhD students can request up to TWO CS/CSE courses.
MS students can request up to FOUR CS/CSE courses.
The College staff will process the permit requests prior to the opening of the time tickets for graduate students. It is a MANUAL process that will take SEVERAL DAYS to complete, so please be patient.
The Permit Restrictions will NOT be removed during this phase of registration.
The Major Restrictions will NOT be removed during this phase of registration.
Phase I registration will end on May 19 at 4PM.
We know this is not ideal, but the hoarding behavior of some graduate students, and the unavoidable limitations of the registration system, make these measures necessary.
**You must limit your course search to “Georgia Tech-Atlanta” campus, so you aren’t seeing classes for which you are unable to register. Do not choose any sections that begin with “O”. **

Team IDs Real-world Vulnerabilities In Popular Browser During Premier Hackathon
A team of College of Computing students came in second at Pwn2Own, one of the world’s top hacking competition.
School of Computer Science (SCS) Associate Professor Taesoo Kim’s Systems Software & Security Lab (SSlab) Ph.D. students Insu Yun, Yong Hwi Jin, and Jung Won Lim competed in the annual event. Their objective was to exploit popular software with unknown vulnerabilities.
“As a hacker studying offensive security, we always dreamed of participating in Pwn2Own,” Yun said.
The SCS team exploited Apple’s Safari internet browser. Although the browser category is known to be more difficult, the team was attracted to how technically interesting the challenge was, according to Yun.
The team was also set up for success because the underlying Safari operating system is *nix, a category the team members were familiar with. Adding to their advantage, they also had written an exploit for Safari just last July so they were able to apply that knowledge here as well.
Multiple vulnerabilities are required to attack a modern browser. The team found new six vulnerabilities to compromise Safari, all of which were later confirmed by Apple. To exploit as many vulnerabilities as possible, they used several approaches, including fuzzing, source code review, and reverse engineering.
Ultimately, the competition allowed the team to sharpen skills they can bring back to their SCS research, such as designing automatic tools to find bugs, and identifying vulnerabilities on complex, real-world programs.
“SSlab gave us the opportunity to make a such wonderful team because our
lab is one of the best information security labs in the world with many talented students.”
TEST - This Hybrid Mask is Easy to Make and Helps Prevent Disease Spread
For more information, email vtopping3@gatech.edu
A team of student entrepreneurs at Georgia Tech has developed a do-it-yourself hybrid mask and face shield to help people stay safe during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Using household items, the DIY mask/face shield can be made in 30 minutes or less and requires no 3D printing.
According to Tillson Galloway, a second-year computer science student and one of the creators, the hybrid mask/face shield is designed to be comfortable, convenient, and protect against micro-particles.
“Medical studies indicate that people touch their faces an average of 23 times an hour, which is one of the leading causes of infection. But, there is a shortage of medical-grade masks and most of DIY masks people are using are uncomfortable, ill-fitting, and provide a false sense of security,” said Galloway, who is from Charleston, South Carolina.
“Our hybrid approach prevents people from inadvertently touching their faces because it fully covers the face.”
Dubbed ‘Project FREE: Face Masks Reducing Exposure for Everyone’ by the developers, the hybrid DIY mask/face shield is made using a baseball cap, a jacket zipper, a cotton blend t-shirt, and a clear plastic book cover.

FAQ - Prospective Students
- Should I apply to the CSE or Computer Science (CS) degree program?
- How should I select a home unit in the CSE program?
- Can I change home unit once I have been admitted to the program?
- When do you admit new students?
Should I apply to the CSE or Computer Science (CS) degree program?
The CSE program includes emphases in areas such as high performance computing, data analytics, machine learning & visualization (e.g., for web search or data analytics), modeling and simulation, computational mathematics and numerical computing, computational science, and computational engineering, as discussed elsewhere on this web site. Also, the CSE degree program includes an emphasis on interdisciplinary research.
How should I select a home unit in the CSE program?
For Ph.D. students, an important consideration is the home unit of the program faculty with whom you have the closest research interests, since such faculty will most likely become your research advisor(s). In general, students homed in a particular discipline will be expected to have some proficiency within that discipline; for example, students homed in the School of Biology would be expected to have or develop a proficiency in Biology.
Can I change home unit once I have been admitted to the program?
Yes, with the approval of the home unit to which you are transferring. In most cases, an important consideration in granting such requests will be if a potential research advisor(s) in the home unit to which you wish to transfer has been identified.
When do you admit new students?
Please refer to the home unit website for deadlines. For example, School of CSE students are admitted in the Fall semester.

FAQ
Q: What do I do if a Course is CLOSED?
A: Once the registration cap has been reached for a course, the course is full. In order to request a seat in a closed CS course, you must follow the instructions for waitlisting: http://www.registrar.gatech.edu/ registration/waitlisting.php
Q: Can a professor help me get into the course?
A: Please DO NOT email a professor to seek permission to enroll in his/her course, as professors have no control over this.
Q: What does this error message mean?
A: If you try to register for a course and receive an error message, please refer to the link:
http://www.registrar.gatech.edu/registration/ error.php for an explanation of what the message means.
Q: What if the class and the waitlist are both full?
A: The only thing you can do in this situation is wait until something opens up.
Q: I am not a CoC major, but I want permission to take a class. How do I do that?
A: The College of Computing does not issue permit for restricted classes. See above for information about when major restrictions will be removed.
Q: I am a graduate student. Can I take the undergraduate version of a course that is cross-listed with both undergrad and grad sections?
A: If you are a grad student, you should take the grad section of a cross-listed course.
Q: When are wait lists removed from classes?
A: The registrar's office usually removes wait lists from classes on the Thursday before Phase II registration ends.
Q. I understand that students appear on wait lists in the order that they attempt to register. Is that initial order ever changed?
A. Yes. Degree candidates may be moved up on the waitlist for classes they must take to satisfy the BSCS degree.
Q. Can I register for a CoC graduate-level course if I didn't receive a permit?
A. If you were not issued a permit for Phase I, this does NOT mean you cannot take the course. You can continue to try to register for your courses during Phase II registration.

Undergraduate Research
Research: Not Just for Grad Students
Doing undergraduate research is the single best way to help your career. The Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Computing (UROC) program can help you get involved through:
- Job fairs, where you can hear about available research jobs
- A spring research symposium, where you can show off your work and win up to $500 in prizes
Students should also be aware of the campus-wide undergraduate research program, UROP. Campus UROP sponsors helpful seminars, a campus-wide research symposium, and the PURA awards to provide funding for research and conference travel if you get a paper accepted.
Research Option
Georgia Tech's Research Option is a special undergraduate program for those who want to develop the research skills and experience that will make a grad school or job application really stand out. It facilitates relationships between faculty and students and allows you to learn about an area of research in greater depth. Completion of Research Option is noted on the student's transcript.
Students in the College of Computing participate in Research Option via the UROC program. Research Option is offered for both Computer Science and Computational Media degrees.
Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Computing (UROC)
Whether you plan to go on to graduate school or a job in industry, doing undergraduate research will bolster your résumé and broaden your post-grad opportunities.
UROC Job Fair

How do I find an advisor and research project?
Is there an area of computer science or computational media that really interests you? If so, then read more about that area and find out which faculty are doing work in the area. Have you had a class with a professor you really liked? Look on the web and read about his/her work.
When you are thinking about who to work with, consider both the research area and the person. Is this faculty member nice? Will he/she find enough time to work with you? Ask your friends - do you know people who have worked with this person before? Get to know the grad students who work with this faculty member. If you will be primarily working with a grad student, what is he/she like?
After you have identified one or two possible advisors, read everything you can about their work. Do your homework - don't approach someone cold. Email the professor letter describing your interest, and asking if you could meet with them to discuss it. If they hold regular office hours, you can drop by during that time. Attach a copy of your resume (or link to your resume available online) to your email.
Don't approach lots of people - pick one or two and be prepared. If you are able to work for course credit, remember to say so. Many faculty have limited money to pay students, but will supervise projects for credit. A job that is initially for credit may turn into a research job for pay later.
You don't need to have a specific idea of exactly what you want to do. An interest in a general area of research and some tentative areas to explore is a good start. Your advisor has lots of big research projects under way, and may wish to find a piece of one of those projects for you to work on. If you do have a specific idea for a research project, feel free to discuss that with your potential advisor. However, make sure to be flexible and listen carefully to the faculty member's response to your suggestions.
In your first term, you may start off doing work that is simply the hard work underlying part of a bigger project. That's OK - that's how you learn. However, as time goes on, make sure your own part of the project has its own research goals, and there is something you can personally take credit for.
What kinds of research projects are available?
Each year the College holds a special UROC job fair in which faculty talk about their research projects and describe the kinds of positions open to undergraduates. The latest job fair was held in November 2014. Below you'll find a sampling of the faculty presentations.
- Computational Linguistics Lab
- Interactive Computing
- Computing Education Research
- Real-Time Transportation System Simulation
- National Science Foundation
- Debugging for Non-Majors
- Designing a Collaborative Web Game for middle school students
- Embedded and Pervasive Computing Research
- Building Big Data Systems
- Wine
Can I do interdisciplinary research?
Absolutely. If your advisor is from your home department, your reader may be from another department. If you wish to complete Research Option with a primary advisor not from your own degree program, then you need to write a short proposal explaining what sort of research you plan to do. This proposal must be approved by the UROC faculty committee. Before you write it up, email uroc@cc.gatech.edu and we'll set up an appointment to discuss your plans with you. All reasonable plans are approved.

- Atlanta Named Top 5 Tech Talent Market, Sees Tech Jobs and Wages Increase
As major corporations move in, startups continue to settle in hotspots like Tech Square, and highly qualified talent remains abundant in the area as tech-focused college students tap into research opportunities in the area, Atlanta is solidifying itself as a cornerstone for technological innovation in the world.
Whether you're looking for a tech hub, yearning for experiences in the arts, searching for the great outdoors, or hoping to enjoy dining, music, and exciting hometown sports, one thing is clear ...
Atlanta is the place to be to Create the Next.
The Great Outdoors
The Great Outdoors
Everyone likes a break from their screens on occasion, and Atlanta offers a host of options to stretch your legs and hit the great outdoors. Visit one of the city's sprawling parks, most notably the 185-acre Piedmont Park just a mile from campus, float the Chattahoochee River, boat around Lake Lanier, or hike dozens of state parks and trails. If you have a long weekend and want to get away, you can even be at the beach inside of five hours.
A City United
Nothing unites a city quite like its hometown sports teams. Atlanta is home to a host of them, including the Atlanta Falcons, Atlanta Braves, Atlanta Hawks, Atlanta Dream, and, the city's newest champion, Atlanta United F.C. With new venues like Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Truist Park and the Battery Atlanta, and the newly renovated State Farm Arena, it has become about much more than just the competition -- they are must-see social experiences.
