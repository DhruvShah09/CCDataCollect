Computing Alum Spotlights Theater Community’s Economic Struggle
Although many businesses have reopened following the spring shutdown, performing arts venues mostly have not. Because of this, people working in the arts have been among the hardest-hit workers during the pandemic.
Workers in Atlanta’s theater community have certainly had to face this challenge as well. Shuttered box offices, canceled productions, and darkened stages have meant little to no work for thousands of people who make their living through the performing arts in venues across the metro area.
“Very little is being done in Atlanta. Everyone from stagehands to actors to parking attendants and all of the others that help make a performance happen are having a really tough time right now,” said Atlanta photographer and GT Computing alumnus Michael Boatright (BS ICS 82 COOP).
“Some stages have grant-type support, which is helping to make rent, but the entertainment industry as a whole is struggling.”
To help rally support for Atlanta’s theater community, Boatright has launched a new photographic exploration called Dark Houses Atlanta, which is now available online.
The visual story documents darkened theaters across metro Atlanta including the Fabulous Fox Theatre, Actor’s Express, and Georgia Tech’s Ferst Center for the Performing Arts. Boatright photographed each stage location as it was, with the set that was in place when the performers and crew left.
“There’s nothing like seeing 4,000 empty seats to help you realize how much you miss being there with a full house,” said Boatright.
He added that it’s important to spotlight the issue for people that are not directly impacted.
“While the theater has survived plagues, social upheaval, and economic hardships, it will need lots of support from the community to survive all three at the same time.”
Boatright began the Dark Houses Atlanta project by first shooting the main stage at the Ferst Center because of his Georgia Tech connection. Along with being an alumnus, he has also been photographing preview performances for DramaTech – Georgia Tech’s student-run theater – for the past six years.
DramaTech is the longest continuously running theater company in the southeastern United States. In March, Boatright emailed asking about the troupe’s upcoming show.
“Of course, they were all very bummed, especially the graduating seniors, it would have been their last show,” said Boatright.
However, rather than canceling altogether, the students decided to put on the show with half-built sets and incomplete technical elements.
“I shot the performance but it was tough; I was crying the whole time because the students played their hearts out. I have never been more proud of a group of people, and I know our future is in good hands with graduating students like that,” said Boatright.

Modeling & Simulation
Represent Natural and Physical Processes
The Modeling & Simulation thread is intended for students interested in developing a deep understanding and appreciation of how natural and human-generated systems such as weather, biological processes, supply chains, or computers, can be represented by mathematical models and computer software. Such models are widely used today to better understand and predict the behavior of such systems.
Because these models are often described and represented by mathematical expressions, and the models themselves often deal with physical phenomena, a background in mathematics and the sciences is required. Combining this background with a knowledge in computer science will yield the basic tools necessary to transform abstract conceptual models to computer programs that execute efficiently on digital machines. The required coursework in Modeling & Simulation includes topics in continuous and discrete mathematics, the sciences, and computing. Elective courses enable students to further develop and apply their knowledge and skills to a specific discipline where Modeling & Simulation plays an important role.
The student who pursues Modeling & Simulation can combine it with Intelligence to become a data miner, or with Media to build visualizations of large amounts of scientific data, or People to build work flow systems for scientists who aren't computing experts to use. The possibilities are endless.

Theory
Discover the theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines.
The Theory thread is where computing models and addresses scaling. Theory quantifies, in mathematical terms, the efficiency by which problems are solved, as problem instances grow in size.
In the Theory thread, students study abstractions of universal computational models, complexity classes within which many natural problems fall, and abstract methods to design efficient algorithms and analyze algorithmic performance. Early preparation includes introduction to programming, discrete math, proof techniques, algorithms and complexity. The student who pursues the Theory thread will eventually learn to formally quantify and improve performance either within theoretical computer science, or within an applied area of computer science, or in another science with a clear computational component (such as computational biology, physics, economics, mathematics, optimization etc).
A student can combine Theory with Information Internetworks to enhance and quantify the performance of networks or databases or pursue security and cryptography, or with Systems & Architecture to design programming languages or build provably efficient systems and software, or with Modeling & Simulation to solve, with proven rigor, a wide range of real-world large scale problems. A student who pursues Theory can combine it with any other thread and enhance those skills with a deep quantitative understanding of performance of the objects studied in the other thread. In addition, in any application related work environment, from a research or development lab, to a consulting firm or the stock market, ability to design tools, reason about them formally, and quantify performance is a skill that greatly enhances one's vita.
A student who pursues the theory thread at Georgia Tech is also an excellent candidate for a Ph.D. in theoretical computer science.

TSO is responsible for setting the automatic door schedules for CCB and KACB (e.g. some door areas are automatically locked during evening and weekend hours). BuzzCard accessible doors will either have a magnetic stripe reader or a proximity reader attached to them.
Based on your role within the CoC, you will be granted automatic default access (see Default Door Access table below) to certain door areas. A door area is a collection of one or more doors in a building. If you need door access to additional areas beyond your automatic allotment, you must seek sponsorship from a CoC faculty or staff member who, in turn, will request access from the steward of the door area. The door area steward will evaluate your request and authorize access if it is warranted.

College of Computing Previews Institute Address
Thursday, President G.P. “Bud” Peterson will present the 2016 Institute Address, during which he will highlight recent Georgia Tech achievements, share his vision and goals for the new school year, and engage in an open Q and A session.
As part of the preparation for the address, the College of Computing had the opportunity to share some of its recent achievements with the president. With limited time, however, and so many notable things happening across campus, there is no way to know what will make it into the presentation.
Therefore, we thought you might like to see the College of Computing slides presented to President Peterson.
Of course, the slides below are just a glimpse of the dynamic people, innovative research, and worthwhile results at #GTComputing. You can keep up with all of this and more by following the College of Computing on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
The full script and slide presentation for the 2016 Institute Address is available on the president's website.
College of Computing Reveals Social Media Contest Winners
No matter where Georgia Tech computing takes you, the adventure never ends! This was the theme of the recently concluded #GTComputingAdventures social media contest sponsored by the College of Computing.
The contest launched June 15 and wrapped up Aug. 10. In that time, more than 150 photos from as far away as Patagonia and Kathmandu were shared to the College’s Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts using the hashtag, #GTComputingAdventures. Each person entering the photo contest will receive a t-shirt designed for the competition.
Two grand prize winners were also selected: one for the photo taken the farthest away from Georgia Tech, and one for the photo with the most likes. These winners will each receive a set of Beats by Dre headphones.
And the winners are…
OMS CS student Genevieve Hayes, aka @murderandagnst, shared the photo taken farthest away from campus. Posted on Twitter, her winning picture of the State Library of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia was taken 9,682 miles away from Georgia Tech.
Taken not quite so far away, the photo entry that earned the most likes depicts a view from Little Si, a mountain in Washington. Shared by Sana Ajani, a third-year Georgia Tech computer science major, this image earned 133 likes on Instagram. @comic_sana, as Ajani is known on Instagram, was in Washington this summer working as an Explorer Intern at Microsoft.
With the success of this summer’s contest, the College of Computing is planning another #GTComputingAdventures contest for next year. Until then, the College encourages students, alumni, faculty, and staff to share their photos and adventures using the hashtag, #GTComputing.

Computing Ranks Well for Gender Diversity Says Industry Report
A recent industry report finds that Georgia Tech is doing comparatively well when it comes to the gender diversity of its computer science (CS) faculty.
The report from CrowdStrike, a global cybersecurity company, says that Georgia Tech ranks second in the U.S. for gender diversity among CS faculty. According to the report, women comprise 23.8 percent of the CS faculty at Georgia Tech.
“Pushing forward on gender equity is a top strategic driver for the College and the Institute so I’m pleased that we have ranked well in this report. There is still much to be done, but this is solid evidence that our efforts to even the playing field are paying off, and that we are moving in the right direction,” said Charles Isbell, Georgia Tech dean of computing and John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
In the report, Duke University ranks first with women making up 27.4 percent of its CS faculty. Harvard University ranks third with 23.7 percent female CS faculty. The U.S. average is 18.7 percent.
The analysis examined faculty listings on websites for the top 25 CS schools as ranked in U.S. News and World Report’s 2018 graduate program rankings. It included data for professors, instructors, and researchers, but does not include staff members.
The reasons for bringing attention to gender diversity in computer science are clear. The CrowdStrike report references data from a recent Microsoft survey that showed that women are 52 percent more likely to stay in STEM fields if they have a female role model.
According to the report, “The fewer female computer science academics there are, the less likely female students are to continue to study computer sciences, graduate with a computer sciences degree and go on to inspire other females to do so.”
“I’m exceedingly proud of our female faculty members. The mentorship, leadership, and guidance they provide, and the example they set, are vitally important to the ongoing success of our female students at every level,” said Isbell.
Along with this encouraging news about faculty gender diversity, the College is also seeing positive growth in female student enrollments.
Nationally, 18 percent of undergraduate CS majors are women. According to enrollment data, 27 percent of CS majors at Georgia Tech are women. The percentage of female CS Ph.D. students nationally is 21 percent, while at Tech 24 percent of CS Ph.D. students are female.
Overall, total female enrollment in B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. programs, has grown from 16 percent of GT Computing students a decade ago to 21 percent today. This equates to 31 percent growth in female enrollment in the College over the past decade.
CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Georgia Tech College of Computing alumnus.

Cassie Mitchell: An Assistant Professor Pioneering Research in Predictive Medicine While Chasing Paralympic Gold
On her desk sits a sign that says “Never, never, never give up.” There could not be a more fitting sign for Cassie Mitchell to have on display. A former track star with dreams of becoming an orthopedic surgeon, Mitchell is now an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech. She is also a Paralympic medalist. It’s not exactly the path she would have chosen herself, but she’s proud of it.
From Cowgirl to City Slicker
To many of Mitchell’s friends and family back home in Oklahoma, she is an “animal whisperer.” She always seems to know what to do with animals, including calming down a 2,000-pound bull, which is a gift even more amazing to behold now that Mitchell is wheelchair-bound quadriplegic.
“I think it would surprise people to know that the girl spinning around in a wheelchair, looking at multi-factorial diseases in a lab in a big city, is the same girl who grew up competing in goat-tying, barrel racing, and pole bending,” said Mitchell laughing.
As a teenager, Mitchell rehabbed a retired racehorse and together the duo won five world titles in equine events, the first of many sports world titles that Mitchell would claim.
The Moment That Changed Everything
At age 12, Mitchell started to experience double vision and blurred vision. After waking up paralyzed at the age of 18, the track scholarship student was diagnosed with neuromyletitis optica – more commonly known as Devic’s disease. Overnight, Mitchell saw her dreams come crashing down as the disease left her paralyzed from the neck down and with permanent double vision.
“I lost my track scholarship, and my dreams of becoming an orthopedic surgeon just vanished. That was really hard,” said Mitchell.
Though her athletic scholarship was gone, Mitchell had graduated valedictorian of her high school and was offered an academic scholarship to Oklahoma State University.
It was during an advising session that she chose engineering.
“Being from a small, rural town. I had no idea what engineering was. They suggested it to me because I had tested really high in math and science, so I was like cool, that sounds good. Then I had to choose between electrical, chemical, and mechanical - biomedical wasn’t even an option then - and I picked chemical because I enjoyed chemistry. That’s how I became an engineer,” said Mitchell.
After graduation, Mitchell worked for ExxonMobil in reservoir modeling, but medicine was always calling her name. A few years later, she decided to earn a Ph.D. and applied to three schools with three very different programs.
She eventually chose Georgia Tech and Emory University’s dual Ph.D. program in biomedical engineering, a choice that stemmed from her own personal experience and her new goals.
“Looking back, I can see the writing on the wall that was pointing the doctors to Devic’s disease. But in the middle of all of it, it was so hard to pair different symptoms together. I’m hoping that my work in predictive medicine will make patient care better, leading to quicker, more accurate diagnoses.”
Going for the Gold
While in college, Mitchell was spotted by a coach who took note of her wheelchair agility. He asked if she had ever played wheelchair basketball. Mitchell had played some basketball in high school, but had not yet attempted any sports as a disabled person.
She soon joined Oklahoma State’s team and played for four seasons before the severe progression of her paralysis and vision damage put a stop to her rising basketball career. Still, the time proved crucial to Mitchell both on and off of the court.
“My insurance wouldn’t cover me to go to rehab, so when I left the hospital for the first time I had no idea how to do anything,” said Mitchell.
“All my teammates during this time were amazing. My life had completely changed, but I had zero guidance on how to adapt. It was nice to be surrounded by other people with disabilities who taught me so many tricks and tips.”
She later tried quad rugby, which she dubbed “murderball,” but decided that she needed to play an individual sport. Playing an individual sport would allow Mitchell to simultaneously be an elite Team USA athlete and have a successful research and professional career. Mitchell chose to compete in paracycling and her first love, track and field.
Mitchell set a goal to reach the 2012 Paralympics and quickly started to win titles and set records in her new sports. In 2011, she became the first female quadriplegic Paracycling National and World Champion. Mitchell currently holds seven Para Athletics world records in female quadriplegic track and field events.
In 2012, she made Team USA and made her Paralympic debut in London, competing in the T52 100m & 200m and the F52 discus, placing 4th in each event.
Unsatisfied with her performance, Mitchell trained hard for the 2016 games. Shortly before the trials, Mitchell was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a rare blood cancer. Despite the diagnosis, Mitchell continued to train and made the team again, all while undergoing chemotherapy. In Rio, she took home a silver and a bronze medal in discus and club throw respectively. She has her eyes set on bringing home a gold in 2020.
Achieving the Three C’s
While most labs employ graduate students to assist with research, Mitchell made an unusual choice. Her lab mainly consists of undergraduates – sometimes up to 30 – along with a few graduate students.
“People told me I was crazy and could ruin my career by working with so many undergraduates, but the undergrads have been amazing. We now have a great system, and these students are like family to me.”
The lab focuses on predictive medicine and multi-factorial diseases, covering health issues like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s, obesity, asthma, cancer, and more. By combining machine learning, artificial intelligence, and biostatistics principles, they are able to achieve “the three C’s” – identify causes, develop cures, and optimize care.
“I didn’t want to only do work that helps people 30 years from now. I also want to make people’s lives better right now.”
Because big pharmaceutical companies don’t invest in ALS, Mitchell has spent a significant amount of time dedicated to this disease in particular, allowing her to make a big impact. The lab recently published an article that could change how soon Medicare distributes a certain machine for ALS patients, which could lead to extending their life by more than double.
Another aspect that makes Mitchell’s lab unique is its approach to algorithms. Instead of only developing new algorithms, they also take ones that have been put on a shelf, tune them up, and insert them into the pipeline to solve a biomedical problem.
“We’re more of applied machine learning, where we take pieces of methods, put them together in new ways, and try to solve a big puzzle. It’s challenging because creating a non-biomedical algorithm is hard enough, but add in all of the unpredictable biology and chemistry of the human body, and it gets even more difficult,” said Mitchell.
Always Look for the Good
Moving forward, Mitchell is excited to increase Georgia Tech’s level of accessibility and inclusion. She was selected as a 2019 Georgia Tech Diversity and Inclusion Fellow, and is helping to head up ABLE Alliance, Georgia Tech’s first accessibility organization.
“I think this campus is long overdue for an accessibility overhaul. There haven’t been a ton of resources out there, and I’ve had so many disabled students come through my door looking for help. Given that we are Georgia Tech, we can do so much to help our students be successful in this environment.”
The alliance was started last spring and will pick up steam this coming academic year.
Mitchell also volunteers as a counselor for people who have undergone similar trauma, including patients at the Shepherd Center Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Hospital.
“I believe we have a choice about everything in our lives. Sure, I wouldn’t pick to be in a wheelchair, but I can choose to see the good in it. It’s a daily choice, and sometimes it’s easy and sometimes it’s hard. I try to help other people realize that the most important thing they can do every day is never give up.”
Georgia Tech Launches Online Master's Degree Program in Cybersecurity
The Georgia Institute of Technology has announced a new online cybersecurity master’s degree that will be offered for less than $10,000 and delivered in collaboration with edX. The Online Master of Science in Cybersecurity (OMS Cybersecurity) is designed to address a severe global workforce shortage in the field. According to the 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study, the shortage is expected to reach 1.8 million people by 2022.
Georgia Tech is the only nationally ranked Top 10 university to offer such a program at a tuition rate intended to increase higher education accessibility and affordability. The degree has existed on campus since 2002 and costs $20,000 for in-state students and $40,000 for those out-of-state. Applications for spring 2019 are open now until October 1.
The OMS Cybersecurity program will launch January 7, 2019 with 250 students and will scale over time to meet demand and student needs. The program is designed to serve working professionals who can study part-time and earn the degree within two to three years. It is richly technical and offers the same three interdisciplinary tracks available on campus beginning with information security and followed by policy and energy systems in fall 2019.
“Georgia Tech’s OMS Cybersecurity degree pairs world-class computer science, engineering, and public policy instruction with Georgia Tech Research Institute’s legacy of applied research in areas related to military, government, and law enforcement,” said Rafael L. Bras, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs and K. Harrison Brown Family Chair. "As demand continues to grow, Georgia Tech is proud to deliver innovative, affordable, top quality education in high-demand areas, like cybersecurity, to learners around the nation and world.”
OMS Cybersecurity is Georgia Tech’s third at-scale online degree program. It will follow the same model as the groundbreaking online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program, which launched in 2014 on Udacity with support from AT&T and has enrolled approximately 10,000 students overall for the $6,800 degree. The Institute followed on that success in 2017 by launching the Online Master of Science in Analytics on edX with support from AT&T and Accenture, which currently has 706 students in its second semester and costs less than $10,000.
Stackable, affordable, and accessible
“We are excited to strengthen our partnership with Georgia Tech by now offering two top-ranked online master’s degrees in high-demand fields to learners all over the world,” said Anant Agarwal, edX chief executive officer and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “The new OMS Cybersecurity follows on the success of the stacked OMS Analytics on edX, which offers learners the option to start with a MicroMasters program on edX that can count toward their full master’s degree. This collaboration with Georgia Tech is the latest milestone in creating stackable, affordable, and accessible online master’s degrees in subjects that address today’s global skill gaps.”
OMS Cybersecurity is built on the proven success of the on-campus Master of Science in Cybersecurity, which was started as a master’s degree in information security in 2002 by Mustaque Ahamad, associate director, Institute for Information Security & Privacy, professor, School of Computer Science, and co-founder and chief scientist at Pindrop, a cybersecurity company. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the cybersecurity field, the program was broadened to include tracks in energy systems and policy.
“The on-campus program has a long history as a world-class master’s degree in information security,” said Ahamad. “Graduates from this degree have gone on to become top leaders in the field.”
"Cybersecurity is a global problem,” said Milton Mueller, professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Public Policy, “The OMS format not only extends Georgia Tech's reach to American professionals in cybersecurity but also makes it possible for working professionals anywhere in the world to avail themselves of Tech's educational resources and expertise."
Workforce need, industry observation propel new degree
The U.S. will have 265,000 more cybersecurity jobs than skilled workers by 2022, as projected by the ISC Center for Cyber Safety and Education. Cybersecurity job postings continue to surge, having increased by 71 percent between 2012 and 2017. Job postings specifying a master’s degree have grown by 73 percent during the same period, based on data provided in the 2017 Burning Glass/Labor Insights Report. The report also cites the Washington D.C. metro area as ranking first in the country for cybersecurity employment opportunities with 44,244 job postings.
"As chief information security officers work to protect organizations from malicious cyber threats, they have difficulty finding trained people to staff their team. The cybersecurity workforce pipeline is a critical component to the future of our nation’s economic and national security posture. CISOs are excited to hear about Georgia Tech’s degree providing enhanced training and teaching multi-faceted skills for employment in the cybersecurity job market,” said Patrick Gaul, executive director of the National Technology Security Coalition.
OMS Cybersecurity is an interdisciplinary collaboration between Georgia Tech’s School of Computer Science in the College of Computing, the School of Public Policy in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering.
"The OMS Cybersecurity degree offers the same comprehensive, rigorous curriculum as the on-campus program," said Raheem Beyah, faculty lead for the program, Motorola Foundation Professor and associate chair for Strategic Initiatives and Innovation in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and co-founder of Fortiphyd Logic, Inc., an industrial control cybersecurity company. “Courses are taught by leaders in the field of cybersecurity research who are sought after by industry and government entities for their knowledge and expertise."
Courses for the program will be designed and produced for online delivery by Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE), the Institute’s lifelong learning arm that has provided professional education for more than 40 years.
“OMS Cybersecurity is designed for working professionals aiming to develop deep expertise in cybersecurity without interrupting their careers,” said Nelson Baker, dean of GTPE. “With this degree, we’re able to offer them the opportunity to build careers in a rapidly growing field while delivering cybersecurity experts to industry to address extreme workforce shortages.”

“The ICPC is a global community of universities and volunteers who come together to provide an opportunity for students of computing to develop excellence in problem-solving,” said Deputy ICPC Executive Director Jeff Donahoo, who is also a computer science professor at Baylor University.
“It is only fitting that our first NAC is being hosted by the Georgia Tech College of Computing, an institution known globally for excellence in research and education.”
The 55 regional teams from the United States and Canada competing in the 2020 ICPC NAC – each with three students and a coach – will vie for six challenge medals, rankings, and the chance to be the inaugural ICPC North America Champions.
Students, coaches, and others wanting to keep up with developments or share their experiences can use the hashtag #icpcNAC20 for the event.
The winning team, along with 2019 regional winners, will advance to the 2020 ICPC World Finals in Moscow. Teams winning a wildcard or one of six challenge medals will also move on to the finals, scheduled for June 21-26.
The ICPC is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. The ICPC operates under the auspices of the ICPC Foundation, which was founded to advance the art and sport of competitive programming for the benefit of society. More than 320,000 students have competed in ICPC since it began in 1970. In 2018, nearly 53,000 students from more than 3,200 universities in 110 countries participated in ICPC events.
While You Were Away: GT Computing 2019 Summer Highlights
Whether you were interning, traveling, building Star Wars sand sculptures, or binge-watching Black Mirror, chances are you weren't fully tuned into the College this summer.
Not to worry. We're here to catch you up on all of the big stories you may have missed.
Probably the biggest news this summer, nay, this year is that the College has a new dean. Stepping up from the faculty ranks, Charles Isbell took the helm as the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing on July 1. He is the fourth person to hold this position.
His philosophy as dean is built on the foundation he laid long ago as an undergraduate.
“To me, it’s all about community,” he said. “I want people to feel like they belong, and that the community reflects their experiences. I want people to feel that the things they’re learning apply to their worlds.”

Suitable for Framing: Galil Portrait 'Captures Something Real'
Before we could welcome Dean Isbell, we had to say farewell to Dean Zvi Galil. Galil stepped down as the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing in June following his announcement in 2018.
Galil became GT Computing dean in July 2010. Under his leadership, the College has seen significant enrollment growth at the undergraduate and graduate levels, achievement in interdisciplinary research and thought leadership, goal-breaking fundraising efforts, and the development and continued success of the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program.

Graduate Fellowship Fund Honors CS Alum
The College celebrated the life and memory of Sastry V. Nanduri this summer by establishing a graduate fellowship fund in his name. An alumnus, entrepreneur, and former College advisory board member, Nanduri passed away last year.
He was passionate about solving real-world problems, and a mentor and teacher who sought to share his passions with others.
Interim Chairs to Guide Schools During Search Process
In June, the names of interim chairs were announced for two of the College of Computing’s three schools. Srinivas Aluru began as interim chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) in June, while Mostafa Ammar began earlier this month as interim chair of the School of Computer Science (SCS).

Alumnae Receive Prestigious Awards at CHI 2019
Just as the Spring 2019 semester was wrapping up, two alumnae were recognized by the CHI community in Glasgow, U.K., one for her overall contributions in human-computer interaction at the conference, and another for her long history of promoting social action within the community.
Jennifer Mankoff, one of Professor Gregory Abowd’s first of 30 Ph.D graduates in 2001, was inducted into the prestigious CHI Academy this week, and Gillian Hayes (2007), also advised by Abowd, was awarded the Social Impact award.
Queer in AI Fosters Inclusion in the Research Community
Gender bias is one of the most pressing issues in artificial intelligence (AI) today, but what if even just sorting data by gender is part of the problem? This question is one of many that the group Queer in AI asks.
College of Computing alumnus and Google AI Resident Rapha Gontijo Lopes co-founded the group in 2018 to create a community for queer researchers and to raise awareness of LGBTQIA+ issues in AI and machine learning (ML).
New Approach Cuts Time Needed for Genomic Testing
From disease-causing organisms to mutations caused by cancer, the first step in diagnosing many health concerns often begins with identifying variations in genomes. But, this can take several days with existing technology.
A new algorithm developed at Georgia Tech, however, is shifting this paradigm by dramatically reducing the time it takes to identify genomic variations in a cell or organism to just a few hours or even minutes.
Samira Samadi Researches Theory that Can Help Everyone
When Samira Samadi was in her third year of college, she took a class on the theory of computation where she learned about the Turing machine. The Church-Turing thesis, named after two renowned mathematicians, states that a simple abstract machine can determine any algorithmically solvable problem. The class was life-changing for the Sharif University of Technology mathematics student.
“It was super cool that such a simple structure can describe any algorithm or computation that a computer or a human could do,” she said. “It was a window for me that what I study could go far beyond the abstract. I could do great things with it.”

Frogger Used to Demo Breakthrough Explainable AI
Why did the frog cross the road? Well, a new artificial intelligent (AI) agent that can play the classic arcade game Frogger not only can tell you why it crossed the road, but it can justify its moves in everyday language.
Developed by Georgia Tech, in collaboration with Cornell and the University of Kentucky, the work enables an AI agent to provide a rationale for a mistake or errant behavior, and to explain it in a way that is easy for non-experts to understand.
“If the power of AI is to be democratized, it needs to be accessible to anyone regardless of their technical abilities,” said Upol Ehsan, Ph.D. student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech and lead researcher.

CS Majors Helping Automate a Safe Return to In-person Work and School
A new automated tool that uses the latest Covid-19 health and safety research is on track to help organizations plan and implement a safe return to in-person work and school amid the pandemic.
Called Rotations, the web-based platform was selected on Jan. 28 as the winning concept for Hack Covid-19, a student hackathon organized by Emory Global Health Institute and Georgia Tech. The winning team includes two Georgia Tech computer science (CS) majors.
Rotations is an automated schedule generator that helps mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in shared workspaces. According to its developers, the tool uses current health and safety data to auto-generate schedules, as well as suggested seating layouts, optimized to keep returning in-person employees and students safe.
“We put ourselves in the place of an office manager or school administrator and asked, ‘What kind of tool could make returning to in-person functions as easy as possible and how could we minimize the spread of the virus as much as possible at the same time?’” said Arvin Poddar, Rotations team member and third-year Georgia Tech CS major.
The schedules and seating charts output by the platform are customizable based on variables unique to a particular workspace. These can include a maximum number of people, square footage of a room, ventilation, and other factors. These data points are also used to calculate a safety score that integrates available research resources.
“We are trying to change the game by looking at the research and seeing how floor layouts can truly be optimized with data,” said Merissa Coleman, team member and a third-year human health major from Emory University.
Another feature that helps mitigate the spread of the virus is the platform’s ability to automatically stagger arrival times for in-person employees. This helps to minimize contact and ensure proper social distancing. If someone does report contracting Covid-19, the platform has a contact tracing function that will automatically alert all of those that were in recent contact with that person.
“We wanted the product to be applicable to both management and employees. So, along with being easy to use, we wanted to be able to give peace of mind to those returning to the office and the classroom,” said Coleman.
As the winners of the Hack Covid-19 competition, Coleman, Poddar, and teammate Ryan Cobelli – also a Georgia Tech CS major – receive a $3,500 cash prize and earn a spot in the CREATE-X Startup Launch program this summer. CREATE-X is Georgia Tech’s entrepreneurial accelerator for students that helps develop projects like Rotations into business startups.
“As we know, Covid is changing every day and the situation is evolving. So, we are really looking forward to developing this product into something that people can really use,” said Poddar.
A primary feature that the team would like to develop while participating in the Startup Launch program is direct integration of the Rotations tool. Being able to directly connect with systems that schools and businesses already use will do away with the current need for administrators to manually upload .csv files to develop rosters.
Beyond this, Poddar sees potential for even more integration with existing systems.
“Ultimately, maybe Rotations doesn’t even need to be its own stand-alone platform. Maybe it could be directly integrated into an existing HR system or learning management platform,” said Poddar.

From the Dean's Desk - Aug. 18, 2020
Dear GT Computing community,
I am pleased to note that Vivek Sarkar has officially taken over as the chair of the School of Computer Science as of this week. With Haesun Park in place as chair of Computational Science and Engineering as of last week, we now have our full slate of school leadership in place. Also, not for nothing, but I am very pleased to note that out of our four schools and divisions, three are now headed by women. The College is modeling what it means to create excellence by bringing together a diverse group of leaders, something we know we need across our entire field.
I would like once again to thank Srinivas Aluru and Mostafa Ammar for serving as interim chairs for CSE and SCS for the past year. I would say that we will miss their leadership, but we have nothing to worry about there. Srinivas will continue in his role as Executive Director of IDEAS, and Mostafa is sticking around to help the College launch our new School for Cybersecurity and Privacy. He will be working with Mustaque Ahamad and Wenke Lee, as well as other faculty across the Institute, to help build SCP in preparation for the day it fully opens its doors.
On a more prosaic note, I want to remind everyone who comes into campus to pick up their Institute-provided PPE, namely two masks and a personal refillable bottle of hand sanitizer. The locations for each building are as follows:
- Coda: Floor 12E, Coda Support Services Team. Please call (404) 374-7378 and wait outside the of the CSS glass doors for service.
- CCB: CCB Mailroom 033
- Klaus: CCB Mailroom 033
- TSRB: Cori Wilson, Room 211
There have been some other changes to our operations now that we have students back on campus; please consult our business continuity webpage for updates on building access, deliveries, facilities and mail.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - Aug. 3, 2021
There are so many things going on as we prepare to work our way back to campus.
First off, let me thank all the folks crafting return-to-campus plans. We seem to be converging on a reasonable starting place, and that’s happening because of everyone working together thoughtfully.
Speaking of back to campus, you may have seen a note from President Cabrera in your e-mail inbox recently. He has asked that everyone consider wearing a mask while on campus. Please note that this is not a mask mandate: because GT is a state entity, the belief is that we are not subject to the City of Atlanta’s mask mandate. I’m not sure where this is all going to end up, but the conversations are ongoing. In the meantime, I would like to echo the President and encourage you to be thoughtful about wearing a mask. Stay informed and aware as facts are changing on the ground day by day.
Oh! I know I sent a dispatch about the new NSF AI institutes last week, but for more context, I encourage you to read President Cabrera’s message to alumni about AI at Georgia Tech. There’s a bit of CoC history (I’m looking at you Ron) and a description of the bright future ahead.
In other good news, our own Srinivas Aluru has been named editor-in-chief of the journal IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. His appointment will start on August 1 and run through December 2024. Please join me in congratulating Srinivas for his intellectual leadership.
Finally, I’d like to mention Highcharts Sonification Studio, Bruce Walker’s (IC) new open-source tool for the sonification of charts. This research makes it possible to listen to data as well as look at it, which, um, sounds amazing. It is clearly beneficial to everyone and a real boon to those with visual impairments.
So there you go. There’s a week and a semester ahead of us. Take some time to stomp your feet, shake your groove thing, or, you know what?, do the conga. Or do what I’m going to try to do sometime this century and just rest. I shall see you before too long.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - July 13, 2021
Dear GT Computing community,
It’s July, and that means it’s beginning to feel like summer. It’s July 2021, and that means we’re coming up on the long-awaited return to campus. I’d like to take a moment to talk a little bit about how that will likely look. Of course, the details will vary from group to group and person to person, but we can see the outline for the rest of the year.
First, there’s the timing. Classes begin for the Fall semester on Monday, August 23. This is the key date around which most of our plans must revolve. In particular, the students will be fully back on campus studenting. As such, all of us across the entire campus have to plan to engage fully with them by then. Some of us will have to engage even before then in order to prepare for their arrival. Actually, many of us are on campus now (quite literally today) managing our once-again-in-person FASET meetings with parents and new students.
Second, I think we all know work will look a little different this Fall and it will continue to evolve over the rest of the year. Just as with timing, how we return to campus will likely look different for different groups. I am empowering different offices and supervisors across the College to create plans for their teams consistent with what we know is allowed by GT and USG rules. Our goal is to be at least as—and even more—flexible than we were pre-COVID on the one hand but to also make sure that our plans for each team across the College allows us to serve our constituents even more effectively and efficiently. Online and virtual services are wonderful, but they absolutely mean that more, not fewer, will take advantage of these services. We need each group to think deeply about what you do and how best to be effective in this new environment.
Finally, I’d like to reiterate the Institute’s rules around masking and social distancing. Outside of labs, no one can require another person to wear a mask. You may not put up signs asking visitors to your offices or spaces to wear masks. Now, it may be within your good judgment to wear a mask yourself, and if so I encourage you to do so. But we must follow Institute rules on this matter.
And there we go. We have a little bit of thought and effort ahead of us, but I believe that if we work together we’ll end up in a better place for everyone in the GT family eventually.
Oh, before I let you go, I would like to share that one of our graduates, Andrea Fletcher (BS CS ’16), has been profiled in the Wall Street Journal, talking about her dream career working for Roblox. As we all work through our worries about going back to work, let us remember that we are making dreams come true. It’s worth it.
So keep that difference you make in the lives of so many in mind for the next month or year or decade or so. And for now, enjoy the weather, get out and play, see your friends and family. Be safe. I’ll see you soon.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - July 20, 2021
Dear GT Computing community,
I’ve got some good news today. Georgia Tech has just been rated #5 globally for computer science research by Guide2Research.com.
Now, there are a lot of rankings out there, but this one is particularly interesting because it’s based on our collective h-index. For those who don’t know, the h-index is a measurement that tracks how much a researcher publishes and (importantly) how many other researchers are citing their work. It is a kind of shorthand for our intellectual influence.
As we all know, rankings are useless, except the ones I like, and I like this one because it shows that the research we do here is influential.
In other good news, the College of Computing has three alumni on this year's 40 under 40 list:
- Mahdi Al-Husseini (MS CS '20), an aeromedical evacuations officer for the U.S. Army who also develops technology and policy for aviation safety.
- Vanessa Larco (BS CS '08), venture capitalist and founding member of LatinXVC, a group to help Latinos enter venture capitalism.
- Dhawal Shah (MS CS '10), CEO of Class Central, a website that has matched more than 40 million users to online education programs.
Finally, I’m starting to hear from teams across the College who are formulating their work plans for fall. Please continue working with your supervisors as they fill out the details.
So there you go. Have a good week. Find some time to take it easy. Take a moment and go for a drive, spend time with your friends and your family. I’ll see you back here next week. I have to go catch a plane.
Peace.

Dear GT Computing community,
It’s the last day of summer classes, and we are all turning our attention to the fall semester, and to our return to campus.
I’m sure everyone is working with their supervisors to hammer out their work arrangements for the fall. As is always the case, different groups have different needs and different responsibilities, so plans may be a little different from one group to another; however, I do expect some strong commonalities:
- Fall classes start on August 23, so plan to “start” next month, probably close to August 16 for most of us.
- In the Before Times(tm) we were allowed one work-from-home day a week as a default, and I expect most of us will be able to see that rise to two as a default. For some, that increase will not work out (just as one day a week did not for every group). Some will be able to make an extraordinarily good case showing that more remote work will improve productivity.
- Things happen, so I expect each team to have on-campus coverage every day.
No matter where we end up, these plans must reflect what’s best for each group and will require that as groups we will work together to make the right thing happen. Speaking of where we end up, this is just the first step. I very much expect that both CoC and the Institute will be able to revisit these plans before the end of the year as we figure out what works, and put in the infrastructure to help us to work better, remotely or otherwise.
I know the return to campus can be a source of uncertainty and irritation, but we’ll figure it out. More importantly, it’s not all uncertainty and irritation. I suspect many of you are very happy at the thought that we will be together again. I know I am. In fact, we are planning a year of celebration with events, T-shirts and more. Our theme is the Power of Two, capturing what we can accomplish when we come together to pursue our common goals. We have shown that power through the last year, pulling together through crisis after crisis, and I want to celebrate how that energy will carry us to new heights moving forward. More on the nerdy future events later.
In the meantime, let me end by noting that our own Andrea Grimes Parker (SIC) is co-PI on a $2.4 million grant to develop a virtual health counselor called Clara. Clara is designed to address vaccine hesitancy and will be piloted in 12 Black churches in Boston. Please join me in thanking Andrea for her intellectual leadership, and for her work using technology for the public good.
That’s all for today. Have a good week, and make sure you take some time to relax. Head out to the country, or into the city, or just stay home and relax. I shall see you here next week.
Peace.

Sonia Chernova (SIC) is the PI and Beth Mynatt is the co-PI of the NSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups (AI-CARING). The AI-CARING institute aims to develop new longitudinal, collaborative AI systems that work with aging adults, including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and their caregivers.
Both of these Institutes build on decades of our research, and both will not only create novel technologies but also train a new generation of researchers. Here in the College of Computing, we strive to build new technologies that improve the human condition, and these Institutes embody that ethos to a T (stolen by the students or otherwise).
Please join me in congratulating Sonia, Beth and Ashok for their intellectual leadership. Congratulations also to Pascal Van Hentenryck of ISyE, who is the PI for the NSF AI Institute for Advances in Optimization (AI4Opt).
These grants, $60 million in total, rest on literal decades of work on AI, aging, and education in the College. They are also at the leading edge of a new wave of investment in AI at Georgia Tech. We are expected to hire 100 new AI researchers in the field over the next few years. CoC is also investing not only in faculty but in graduate fellowships and in new courses teaching AI as a tool for science and engineering.
I couldn’t be more proud of our achievements in AI, and I can’t wait to see what this expansion allows us to do next. We’ve got a lot to celebrate, so enjoy the good times and I will see you back here next week.
Peace.

Dear GT Computing community,
It’s a beautiful day here in Atlanta, and the birds are out singing to celebrate a new fiscal year and the great renewal that comes with it. I’m going to join our avian colleagues and talk today about some changes we are making in the College in order to build on our past successes and set us up for the future. In short, we are expanding and restructuring our Office of Outreach, Enrollment, and Community.
As you know, one of the key strengths of the College is its community. Our community is broad: it includes students, faculty, staff, and alumni, but also those who are joining the field of computing through our outreach efforts. For more than a decade, OEC has spearheaded and supported many of these community efforts. Sometimes quite visibly, sometimes quietly, but always with energy and passion.
OEC has grown dramatically just as our community has grown, and just as the importance of computing has grown. To manage this growth and to increase our impact, we are strengthening all parts of OEC:
- Our corporate and alumni support operations will join the Office of Development. We have partnered with the GT Alumni Association to focus on our young alumni especially and to formalize the pilot programs we have started in the last two years.
- Many of our various internal community, wellness, and enrichment programs will come together in an organization that will report up through Irfan Essa, our Senior Associate Dean.
- Similarly, our many outreach programs in OEC and Constellations will also come together. This restructuring will consolidate the logistical and organizational support that touches so many of our efforts across the College. One important consequence is that the event coordinators from OEC and Communications will come together into a college-level event management group.
All in all, these developments are good for the College and the amazing folks who have worked on these efforts. They will set up for our next wave of growth (I say next but it’s already here) and support our strategic goals, including our focus on increasing the diversity of and access to the field of computing at every stage in the pipeline. The new outreach group will strengthen and add to our existing programs for diversifying the field, which is good for us and for the larger community.
While we’re on the subject of renewal, I have another somewhat mixed announcement to make: Brad Hastings, our exceptional Senior Director of Development, has agreed to serve as the Executive Director of Development for the College of Engineering going forward. That’s good news for CoE but, well, let’s just say I have a few other feelings as well. Having said that, Brad has graciously agreed to continue in his role with CoC for the foreseeable future while we transition to the upcoming campaign.
So there you go. Please enjoy the week ahead. Take some time to sing a song, to dance like no one’s watching (because as I cannot emphasize enough no one is), or just to enjoy the morning sun. I’ll see you again soon, maybe even in person.
Peace.

From the Dean's Desk - June 1, 2020
I’ve thought a lot about it since, but at the time all I could think was: “That’s a really big gun.”
I was at a capital-T Traffic Stop somewhere outside of Cambridge, MA. A police officer was approaching me on the driver’s side and for some reason he went for his gun and yelled at me to be still. I got… stiller… and eventually it was all over and I drove away.
Only later, while trying to calm down my friends did I think, “He could have killed me”.
I’m not sure exactly when that changed to “…and he would have gotten away with it”. I think it was April 29, 1992. That was a day much like the days we’re experiencing now.
In the many years since, my thoughts have returned to that night. They became “…and would anyone have heard about it?” They became, “…and if they did what would they have heard?” Would the reports say I led a high speed chase? Would the pundits say that if only I’d complied, I’d be alive? What would they have dredged up? Maybe somehow that time in seventh grade when I checked out Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret from the library would be held against me.
I don’t know, but it would have been something, and it would be like dying twice.
It’s not always the Traffic Stop. Sometimes I think about the time that guy in the pick up truck spit on me, or the confrontation with the police while I was house hunting. A few weeks ago, I was sitting on a curb in my embarrassingly sprawling neighborhood and someone in a truck drove by, stopped maybe 40 yards away, backed up and stared at me for five or six seconds, then left. “What was that about? What could it have been about?”
My son is 12, all arms and legs. Studies tell me that when he walks down the street, he’ll be more likely mistaken for 16. His 12-year old movements will be threatening. I know: I’ve already had that conversation with teachers.
Yesterday, I sat in my car with him and we talked about what’s going on, and this is neither the first nor second such conversation. He doesn’t quite believe what’s happening, but he believes it more every time we have this conversation. I know he’ll believe it more the next time we are here, the next time someone utters a racial epithet around him. This is a reality I went through, and I know it’s a reality he’ll go through.
My thoughts nowadays are more about him. He’s one candy bar away from “Gun!” and being shot. He’s a moment away from “He should have complied” and “He was no saint” and whatever else they would say. It wouldn’t be true, not this boy who interrupts my meetings to hug me and ask me if he can have apple juice, but I know it would be said.
Of course, I think about other things. In so many ways, my life is great… and I have a lot to do, so I go back to the business of getting through my life and resigning myself to the fact that I really do have to do my taxes this weekend. But the thoughts always come back.
You know what I’m thinking now? As I write this, I’m sitting in my office and I’m looking out at my city. I can see the campus, I can see midtown and downtown, buildings poking out above all the many trees. But I don’t see smoke. I don’t see broken windows. I don’t see all the stories out there. I know that right over there two college kids from Spelman and Morehouse were dragged from their car and tased during the demonstrations this weekend, and I’m sure there are other stories, and some of them probably ended even worse. I know most of them were never recorded, never noted by the public.
I don’t see your story either, but I know you have one. We all do. That’s mostly what I think about at times like these. Everyone has a story. I may not see yours any more than you see mine, but I know you have one.
In the end it’s what binds us together. We all have stories and as often as not they are similar in some important way. It’s how we know we are human together.
And when they are different? Well that’s even more important. Those differences also tell us about each other, even when they are so different that they seem hard to imagine.
Either way, these stories make us the community we are. It is, simply, fundamentally true. And when we realize it, we can change things. It really doesn’t have to be the way it’s always been. We can make it better as a community. In fact, we must.
Look, it’s been a long few weeks, and a very long weekend. Please, stay safe. I’d like to hear you tell your story one day.
Peace.
