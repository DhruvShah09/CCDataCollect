Computing Alum Spotlights Theater Community’s Economic Struggle
Although many businesses have reopened following the spring shutdown, performing arts venues mostly have not. Because of this, people working in the arts have been among the hardest-hit workers during the pandemic.
Workers in Atlanta’s theater community have certainly had to face this challenge as well. Shuttered box offices, canceled productions, and darkened stages have meant little to no work for thousands of people who make their living through the performing arts in venues across the metro area.
“Very little is being done in Atlanta. Everyone from stagehands to actors to parking attendants and all of the others that help make a performance happen are having a really tough time right now,” said Atlanta photographer and GT Computing alumnus Michael Boatright (BS ICS 82 COOP).
“Some stages have grant-type support, which is helping to make rent, but the entertainment industry as a whole is struggling.”
To help rally support for Atlanta’s theater community, Boatright has launched a new photographic exploration called Dark Houses Atlanta, which is now available online.
The visual story documents darkened theaters across metro Atlanta including the Fabulous Fox Theatre, Actor’s Express, and Georgia Tech’s Ferst Center for the Performing Arts. Boatright photographed each stage location as it was, with the set that was in place when the performers and crew left.
“There’s nothing like seeing 4,000 empty seats to help you realize how much you miss being there with a full house,” said Boatright.
He added that it’s important to spotlight the issue for people that are not directly impacted.
“While the theater has survived plagues, social upheaval, and economic hardships, it will need lots of support from the community to survive all three at the same time.”
Boatright began the Dark Houses Atlanta project by first shooting the main stage at the Ferst Center because of his Georgia Tech connection. Along with being an alumnus, he has also been photographing preview performances for DramaTech – Georgia Tech’s student-run theater – for the past six years.
DramaTech is the longest continuously running theater company in the southeastern United States. In March, Boatright emailed asking about the troupe’s upcoming show.
“Of course, they were all very bummed, especially the graduating seniors, it would have been their last show,” said Boatright.
However, rather than canceling altogether, the students decided to put on the show with half-built sets and incomplete technical elements.
“I shot the performance but it was tough; I was crying the whole time because the students played their hearts out. I have never been more proud of a group of people, and I know our future is in good hands with graduating students like that,” said Boatright.

Modeling & Simulation
Represent Natural and Physical Processes
The Modeling & Simulation thread is intended for students interested in developing a deep understanding and appreciation of how natural and human-generated systems such as weather, biological processes, supply chains, or computers, can be represented by mathematical models and computer software. Such models are widely used today to better understand and predict the behavior of such systems.
Because these models are often described and represented by mathematical expressions, and the models themselves often deal with physical phenomena, a background in mathematics and the sciences is required. Combining this background with a knowledge in computer science will yield the basic tools necessary to transform abstract conceptual models to computer programs that execute efficiently on digital machines. The required coursework in Modeling & Simulation includes topics in continuous and discrete mathematics, the sciences, and computing. Elective courses enable students to further develop and apply their knowledge and skills to a specific discipline where Modeling & Simulation plays an important role.
The student who pursues Modeling & Simulation can combine it with Intelligence to become a data miner, or with Media to build visualizations of large amounts of scientific data, or People to build work flow systems for scientists who aren't computing experts to use. The possibilities are endless.

Theory
Discover the theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines.
The Theory thread is where computing models and addresses scaling. Theory quantifies, in mathematical terms, the efficiency by which problems are solved, as problem instances grow in size.
In the Theory thread, students study abstractions of universal computational models, complexity classes within which many natural problems fall, and abstract methods to design efficient algorithms and analyze algorithmic performance. Early preparation includes introduction to programming, discrete math, proof techniques, algorithms and complexity. The student who pursues the Theory thread will eventually learn to formally quantify and improve performance either within theoretical computer science, or within an applied area of computer science, or in another science with a clear computational component (such as computational biology, physics, economics, mathematics, optimization etc).
A student can combine Theory with Information Internetworks to enhance and quantify the performance of networks or databases or pursue security and cryptography, or with Systems & Architecture to design programming languages or build provably efficient systems and software, or with Modeling & Simulation to solve, with proven rigor, a wide range of real-world large scale problems. A student who pursues Theory can combine it with any other thread and enhance those skills with a deep quantitative understanding of performance of the objects studied in the other thread. In addition, in any application related work environment, from a research or development lab, to a consulting firm or the stock market, ability to design tools, reason about them formally, and quantify performance is a skill that greatly enhances one's vita.
A student who pursues the theory thread at Georgia Tech is also an excellent candidate for a Ph.D. in theoretical computer science.

TSO is responsible for setting the automatic door schedules for CCB and KACB (e.g. some door areas are automatically locked during evening and weekend hours). BuzzCard accessible doors will either have a magnetic stripe reader or a proximity reader attached to them.
Based on your role within the CoC, you will be granted automatic default access (see Default Door Access table below) to certain door areas. A door area is a collection of one or more doors in a building. If you need door access to additional areas beyond your automatic allotment, you must seek sponsorship from a CoC faculty or staff member who, in turn, will request access from the steward of the door area. The door area steward will evaluate your request and authorize access if it is warranted.

College of Computing Previews Institute Address
Thursday, President G.P. “Bud” Peterson will present the 2016 Institute Address, during which he will highlight recent Georgia Tech achievements, share his vision and goals for the new school year, and engage in an open Q and A session.
As part of the preparation for the address, the College of Computing had the opportunity to share some of its recent achievements with the president. With limited time, however, and so many notable things happening across campus, there is no way to know what will make it into the presentation.
Therefore, we thought you might like to see the College of Computing slides presented to President Peterson.
Of course, the slides below are just a glimpse of the dynamic people, innovative research, and worthwhile results at #GTComputing. You can keep up with all of this and more by following the College of Computing on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
The full script and slide presentation for the 2016 Institute Address is available on the president's website.
College of Computing Reveals Social Media Contest Winners
No matter where Georgia Tech computing takes you, the adventure never ends! This was the theme of the recently concluded #GTComputingAdventures social media contest sponsored by the College of Computing.
The contest launched June 15 and wrapped up Aug. 10. In that time, more than 150 photos from as far away as Patagonia and Kathmandu were shared to the College’s Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts using the hashtag, #GTComputingAdventures. Each person entering the photo contest will receive a t-shirt designed for the competition.
Two grand prize winners were also selected: one for the photo taken the farthest away from Georgia Tech, and one for the photo with the most likes. These winners will each receive a set of Beats by Dre headphones.
And the winners are…
OMS CS student Genevieve Hayes, aka @murderandagnst, shared the photo taken farthest away from campus. Posted on Twitter, her winning picture of the State Library of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia was taken 9,682 miles away from Georgia Tech.
Taken not quite so far away, the photo entry that earned the most likes depicts a view from Little Si, a mountain in Washington. Shared by Sana Ajani, a third-year Georgia Tech computer science major, this image earned 133 likes on Instagram. @comic_sana, as Ajani is known on Instagram, was in Washington this summer working as an Explorer Intern at Microsoft.
With the success of this summer’s contest, the College of Computing is planning another #GTComputingAdventures contest for next year. Until then, the College encourages students, alumni, faculty, and staff to share their photos and adventures using the hashtag, #GTComputing.

Computing Ranks Well for Gender Diversity Says Industry Report
A recent industry report finds that Georgia Tech is doing comparatively well when it comes to the gender diversity of its computer science (CS) faculty.
The report from CrowdStrike, a global cybersecurity company, says that Georgia Tech ranks second in the U.S. for gender diversity among CS faculty. According to the report, women comprise 23.8 percent of the CS faculty at Georgia Tech.
“Pushing forward on gender equity is a top strategic driver for the College and the Institute so I’m pleased that we have ranked well in this report. There is still much to be done, but this is solid evidence that our efforts to even the playing field are paying off, and that we are moving in the right direction,” said Charles Isbell, Georgia Tech dean of computing and John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
In the report, Duke University ranks first with women making up 27.4 percent of its CS faculty. Harvard University ranks third with 23.7 percent female CS faculty. The U.S. average is 18.7 percent.
The analysis examined faculty listings on websites for the top 25 CS schools as ranked in U.S. News and World Report’s 2018 graduate program rankings. It included data for professors, instructors, and researchers, but does not include staff members.
The reasons for bringing attention to gender diversity in computer science are clear. The CrowdStrike report references data from a recent Microsoft survey that showed that women are 52 percent more likely to stay in STEM fields if they have a female role model.
According to the report, “The fewer female computer science academics there are, the less likely female students are to continue to study computer sciences, graduate with a computer sciences degree and go on to inspire other females to do so.”
“I’m exceedingly proud of our female faculty members. The mentorship, leadership, and guidance they provide, and the example they set, are vitally important to the ongoing success of our female students at every level,” said Isbell.
Along with this encouraging news about faculty gender diversity, the College is also seeing positive growth in female student enrollments.
Nationally, 18 percent of undergraduate CS majors are women. According to enrollment data, 27 percent of CS majors at Georgia Tech are women. The percentage of female CS Ph.D. students nationally is 21 percent, while at Tech 24 percent of CS Ph.D. students are female.
Overall, total female enrollment in B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. programs, has grown from 16 percent of GT Computing students a decade ago to 21 percent today. This equates to 31 percent growth in female enrollment in the College over the past decade.
CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Georgia Tech College of Computing alumnus.

Cassie Mitchell: An Assistant Professor Pioneering Research in Predictive Medicine While Chasing Paralympic Gold
On her desk sits a sign that says “Never, never, never give up.” There could not be a more fitting sign for Cassie Mitchell to have on display. A former track star with dreams of becoming an orthopedic surgeon, Mitchell is now an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech. She is also a Paralympic medalist. It’s not exactly the path she would have chosen herself, but she’s proud of it.
From Cowgirl to City Slicker
To many of Mitchell’s friends and family back home in Oklahoma, she is an “animal whisperer.” She always seems to know what to do with animals, including calming down a 2,000-pound bull, which is a gift even more amazing to behold now that Mitchell is wheelchair-bound quadriplegic.
“I think it would surprise people to know that the girl spinning around in a wheelchair, looking at multi-factorial diseases in a lab in a big city, is the same girl who grew up competing in goat-tying, barrel racing, and pole bending,” said Mitchell laughing.
As a teenager, Mitchell rehabbed a retired racehorse and together the duo won five world titles in equine events, the first of many sports world titles that Mitchell would claim.
The Moment That Changed Everything
At age 12, Mitchell started to experience double vision and blurred vision. After waking up paralyzed at the age of 18, the track scholarship student was diagnosed with neuromyletitis optica – more commonly known as Devic’s disease. Overnight, Mitchell saw her dreams come crashing down as the disease left her paralyzed from the neck down and with permanent double vision.
“I lost my track scholarship, and my dreams of becoming an orthopedic surgeon just vanished. That was really hard,” said Mitchell.
Though her athletic scholarship was gone, Mitchell had graduated valedictorian of her high school and was offered an academic scholarship to Oklahoma State University.
It was during an advising session that she chose engineering.
“Being from a small, rural town. I had no idea what engineering was. They suggested it to me because I had tested really high in math and science, so I was like cool, that sounds good. Then I had to choose between electrical, chemical, and mechanical - biomedical wasn’t even an option then - and I picked chemical because I enjoyed chemistry. That’s how I became an engineer,” said Mitchell.
After graduation, Mitchell worked for ExxonMobil in reservoir modeling, but medicine was always calling her name. A few years later, she decided to earn a Ph.D. and applied to three schools with three very different programs.
She eventually chose Georgia Tech and Emory University’s dual Ph.D. program in biomedical engineering, a choice that stemmed from her own personal experience and her new goals.
“Looking back, I can see the writing on the wall that was pointing the doctors to Devic’s disease. But in the middle of all of it, it was so hard to pair different symptoms together. I’m hoping that my work in predictive medicine will make patient care better, leading to quicker, more accurate diagnoses.”
Going for the Gold
While in college, Mitchell was spotted by a coach who took note of her wheelchair agility. He asked if she had ever played wheelchair basketball. Mitchell had played some basketball in high school, but had not yet attempted any sports as a disabled person.
She soon joined Oklahoma State’s team and played for four seasons before the severe progression of her paralysis and vision damage put a stop to her rising basketball career. Still, the time proved crucial to Mitchell both on and off of the court.
“My insurance wouldn’t cover me to go to rehab, so when I left the hospital for the first time I had no idea how to do anything,” said Mitchell.
“All my teammates during this time were amazing. My life had completely changed, but I had zero guidance on how to adapt. It was nice to be surrounded by other people with disabilities who taught me so many tricks and tips.”
She later tried quad rugby, which she dubbed “murderball,” but decided that she needed to play an individual sport. Playing an individual sport would allow Mitchell to simultaneously be an elite Team USA athlete and have a successful research and professional career. Mitchell chose to compete in paracycling and her first love, track and field.
Mitchell set a goal to reach the 2012 Paralympics and quickly started to win titles and set records in her new sports. In 2011, she became the first female quadriplegic Paracycling National and World Champion. Mitchell currently holds seven Para Athletics world records in female quadriplegic track and field events.
In 2012, she made Team USA and made her Paralympic debut in London, competing in the T52 100m & 200m and the F52 discus, placing 4th in each event.
Unsatisfied with her performance, Mitchell trained hard for the 2016 games. Shortly before the trials, Mitchell was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a rare blood cancer. Despite the diagnosis, Mitchell continued to train and made the team again, all while undergoing chemotherapy. In Rio, she took home a silver and a bronze medal in discus and club throw respectively. She has her eyes set on bringing home a gold in 2020.
Achieving the Three C’s
While most labs employ graduate students to assist with research, Mitchell made an unusual choice. Her lab mainly consists of undergraduates – sometimes up to 30 – along with a few graduate students.
“People told me I was crazy and could ruin my career by working with so many undergraduates, but the undergrads have been amazing. We now have a great system, and these students are like family to me.”
The lab focuses on predictive medicine and multi-factorial diseases, covering health issues like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s, obesity, asthma, cancer, and more. By combining machine learning, artificial intelligence, and biostatistics principles, they are able to achieve “the three C’s” – identify causes, develop cures, and optimize care.
“I didn’t want to only do work that helps people 30 years from now. I also want to make people’s lives better right now.”
Because big pharmaceutical companies don’t invest in ALS, Mitchell has spent a significant amount of time dedicated to this disease in particular, allowing her to make a big impact. The lab recently published an article that could change how soon Medicare distributes a certain machine for ALS patients, which could lead to extending their life by more than double.
Another aspect that makes Mitchell’s lab unique is its approach to algorithms. Instead of only developing new algorithms, they also take ones that have been put on a shelf, tune them up, and insert them into the pipeline to solve a biomedical problem.
“We’re more of applied machine learning, where we take pieces of methods, put them together in new ways, and try to solve a big puzzle. It’s challenging because creating a non-biomedical algorithm is hard enough, but add in all of the unpredictable biology and chemistry of the human body, and it gets even more difficult,” said Mitchell.
Always Look for the Good
Moving forward, Mitchell is excited to increase Georgia Tech’s level of accessibility and inclusion. She was selected as a 2019 Georgia Tech Diversity and Inclusion Fellow, and is helping to head up ABLE Alliance, Georgia Tech’s first accessibility organization.
“I think this campus is long overdue for an accessibility overhaul. There haven’t been a ton of resources out there, and I’ve had so many disabled students come through my door looking for help. Given that we are Georgia Tech, we can do so much to help our students be successful in this environment.”
The alliance was started last spring and will pick up steam this coming academic year.
Mitchell also volunteers as a counselor for people who have undergone similar trauma, including patients at the Shepherd Center Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Hospital.
“I believe we have a choice about everything in our lives. Sure, I wouldn’t pick to be in a wheelchair, but I can choose to see the good in it. It’s a daily choice, and sometimes it’s easy and sometimes it’s hard. I try to help other people realize that the most important thing they can do every day is never give up.”
Georgia Tech Launches Online Master's Degree Program in Cybersecurity
The Georgia Institute of Technology has announced a new online cybersecurity master’s degree that will be offered for less than $10,000 and delivered in collaboration with edX. The Online Master of Science in Cybersecurity (OMS Cybersecurity) is designed to address a severe global workforce shortage in the field. According to the 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study, the shortage is expected to reach 1.8 million people by 2022.
Georgia Tech is the only nationally ranked Top 10 university to offer such a program at a tuition rate intended to increase higher education accessibility and affordability. The degree has existed on campus since 2002 and costs $20,000 for in-state students and $40,000 for those out-of-state. Applications for spring 2019 are open now until October 1.
The OMS Cybersecurity program will launch January 7, 2019 with 250 students and will scale over time to meet demand and student needs. The program is designed to serve working professionals who can study part-time and earn the degree within two to three years. It is richly technical and offers the same three interdisciplinary tracks available on campus beginning with information security and followed by policy and energy systems in fall 2019.
“Georgia Tech’s OMS Cybersecurity degree pairs world-class computer science, engineering, and public policy instruction with Georgia Tech Research Institute’s legacy of applied research in areas related to military, government, and law enforcement,” said Rafael L. Bras, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs and K. Harrison Brown Family Chair. "As demand continues to grow, Georgia Tech is proud to deliver innovative, affordable, top quality education in high-demand areas, like cybersecurity, to learners around the nation and world.”
OMS Cybersecurity is Georgia Tech’s third at-scale online degree program. It will follow the same model as the groundbreaking online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program, which launched in 2014 on Udacity with support from AT&T and has enrolled approximately 10,000 students overall for the $6,800 degree. The Institute followed on that success in 2017 by launching the Online Master of Science in Analytics on edX with support from AT&T and Accenture, which currently has 706 students in its second semester and costs less than $10,000.
Stackable, affordable, and accessible
“We are excited to strengthen our partnership with Georgia Tech by now offering two top-ranked online master’s degrees in high-demand fields to learners all over the world,” said Anant Agarwal, edX chief executive officer and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “The new OMS Cybersecurity follows on the success of the stacked OMS Analytics on edX, which offers learners the option to start with a MicroMasters program on edX that can count toward their full master’s degree. This collaboration with Georgia Tech is the latest milestone in creating stackable, affordable, and accessible online master’s degrees in subjects that address today’s global skill gaps.”
OMS Cybersecurity is built on the proven success of the on-campus Master of Science in Cybersecurity, which was started as a master’s degree in information security in 2002 by Mustaque Ahamad, associate director, Institute for Information Security & Privacy, professor, School of Computer Science, and co-founder and chief scientist at Pindrop, a cybersecurity company. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the cybersecurity field, the program was broadened to include tracks in energy systems and policy.
“The on-campus program has a long history as a world-class master’s degree in information security,” said Ahamad. “Graduates from this degree have gone on to become top leaders in the field.”
"Cybersecurity is a global problem,” said Milton Mueller, professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Public Policy, “The OMS format not only extends Georgia Tech's reach to American professionals in cybersecurity but also makes it possible for working professionals anywhere in the world to avail themselves of Tech's educational resources and expertise."
Workforce need, industry observation propel new degree
The U.S. will have 265,000 more cybersecurity jobs than skilled workers by 2022, as projected by the ISC Center for Cyber Safety and Education. Cybersecurity job postings continue to surge, having increased by 71 percent between 2012 and 2017. Job postings specifying a master’s degree have grown by 73 percent during the same period, based on data provided in the 2017 Burning Glass/Labor Insights Report. The report also cites the Washington D.C. metro area as ranking first in the country for cybersecurity employment opportunities with 44,244 job postings.
"As chief information security officers work to protect organizations from malicious cyber threats, they have difficulty finding trained people to staff their team. The cybersecurity workforce pipeline is a critical component to the future of our nation’s economic and national security posture. CISOs are excited to hear about Georgia Tech’s degree providing enhanced training and teaching multi-faceted skills for employment in the cybersecurity job market,” said Patrick Gaul, executive director of the National Technology Security Coalition.
OMS Cybersecurity is an interdisciplinary collaboration between Georgia Tech’s School of Computer Science in the College of Computing, the School of Public Policy in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering.
"The OMS Cybersecurity degree offers the same comprehensive, rigorous curriculum as the on-campus program," said Raheem Beyah, faculty lead for the program, Motorola Foundation Professor and associate chair for Strategic Initiatives and Innovation in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and co-founder of Fortiphyd Logic, Inc., an industrial control cybersecurity company. “Courses are taught by leaders in the field of cybersecurity research who are sought after by industry and government entities for their knowledge and expertise."
Courses for the program will be designed and produced for online delivery by Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE), the Institute’s lifelong learning arm that has provided professional education for more than 40 years.
“OMS Cybersecurity is designed for working professionals aiming to develop deep expertise in cybersecurity without interrupting their careers,” said Nelson Baker, dean of GTPE. “With this degree, we’re able to offer them the opportunity to build careers in a rapidly growing field while delivering cybersecurity experts to industry to address extreme workforce shortages.”

“The ICPC is a global community of universities and volunteers who come together to provide an opportunity for students of computing to develop excellence in problem-solving,” said Deputy ICPC Executive Director Jeff Donahoo, who is also a computer science professor at Baylor University.
“It is only fitting that our first NAC is being hosted by the Georgia Tech College of Computing, an institution known globally for excellence in research and education.”
The 55 regional teams from the United States and Canada competing in the 2020 ICPC NAC – each with three students and a coach – will vie for six challenge medals, rankings, and the chance to be the inaugural ICPC North America Champions.
Students, coaches, and others wanting to keep up with developments or share their experiences can use the hashtag #icpcNAC20 for the event.
The winning team, along with 2019 regional winners, will advance to the 2020 ICPC World Finals in Moscow. Teams winning a wildcard or one of six challenge medals will also move on to the finals, scheduled for June 21-26.
The ICPC is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. The ICPC operates under the auspices of the ICPC Foundation, which was founded to advance the art and sport of competitive programming for the benefit of society. More than 320,000 students have competed in ICPC since it began in 1970. In 2018, nearly 53,000 students from more than 3,200 universities in 110 countries participated in ICPC events.
While You Were Away: GT Computing 2019 Summer Highlights
Whether you were interning, traveling, building Star Wars sand sculptures, or binge-watching Black Mirror, chances are you weren't fully tuned into the College this summer.
Not to worry. We're here to catch you up on all of the big stories you may have missed.
Probably the biggest news this summer, nay, this year is that the College has a new dean. Stepping up from the faculty ranks, Charles Isbell took the helm as the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing on July 1. He is the fourth person to hold this position.
His philosophy as dean is built on the foundation he laid long ago as an undergraduate.
“To me, it’s all about community,” he said. “I want people to feel like they belong, and that the community reflects their experiences. I want people to feel that the things they’re learning apply to their worlds.”

Suitable for Framing: Galil Portrait 'Captures Something Real'
Before we could welcome Dean Isbell, we had to say farewell to Dean Zvi Galil. Galil stepped down as the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing in June following his announcement in 2018.
Galil became GT Computing dean in July 2010. Under his leadership, the College has seen significant enrollment growth at the undergraduate and graduate levels, achievement in interdisciplinary research and thought leadership, goal-breaking fundraising efforts, and the development and continued success of the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program.

Graduate Fellowship Fund Honors CS Alum
The College celebrated the life and memory of Sastry V. Nanduri this summer by establishing a graduate fellowship fund in his name. An alumnus, entrepreneur, and former College advisory board member, Nanduri passed away last year.
He was passionate about solving real-world problems, and a mentor and teacher who sought to share his passions with others.
Interim Chairs to Guide Schools During Search Process
In June, the names of interim chairs were announced for two of the College of Computing’s three schools. Srinivas Aluru began as interim chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) in June, while Mostafa Ammar began earlier this month as interim chair of the School of Computer Science (SCS).

Alumnae Receive Prestigious Awards at CHI 2019
Just as the Spring 2019 semester was wrapping up, two alumnae were recognized by the CHI community in Glasgow, U.K., one for her overall contributions in human-computer interaction at the conference, and another for her long history of promoting social action within the community.
Jennifer Mankoff, one of Professor Gregory Abowd’s first of 30 Ph.D graduates in 2001, was inducted into the prestigious CHI Academy this week, and Gillian Hayes (2007), also advised by Abowd, was awarded the Social Impact award.
Queer in AI Fosters Inclusion in the Research Community
Gender bias is one of the most pressing issues in artificial intelligence (AI) today, but what if even just sorting data by gender is part of the problem? This question is one of many that the group Queer in AI asks.
College of Computing alumnus and Google AI Resident Rapha Gontijo Lopes co-founded the group in 2018 to create a community for queer researchers and to raise awareness of LGBTQIA+ issues in AI and machine learning (ML).
New Approach Cuts Time Needed for Genomic Testing
From disease-causing organisms to mutations caused by cancer, the first step in diagnosing many health concerns often begins with identifying variations in genomes. But, this can take several days with existing technology.
A new algorithm developed at Georgia Tech, however, is shifting this paradigm by dramatically reducing the time it takes to identify genomic variations in a cell or organism to just a few hours or even minutes.
Samira Samadi Researches Theory that Can Help Everyone
When Samira Samadi was in her third year of college, she took a class on the theory of computation where she learned about the Turing machine. The Church-Turing thesis, named after two renowned mathematicians, states that a simple abstract machine can determine any algorithmically solvable problem. The class was life-changing for the Sharif University of Technology mathematics student.
“It was super cool that such a simple structure can describe any algorithm or computation that a computer or a human could do,” she said. “It was a window for me that what I study could go far beyond the abstract. I could do great things with it.”

Frogger Used to Demo Breakthrough Explainable AI
Why did the frog cross the road? Well, a new artificial intelligent (AI) agent that can play the classic arcade game Frogger not only can tell you why it crossed the road, but it can justify its moves in everyday language.
Developed by Georgia Tech, in collaboration with Cornell and the University of Kentucky, the work enables an AI agent to provide a rationale for a mistake or errant behavior, and to explain it in a way that is easy for non-experts to understand.
“If the power of AI is to be democratized, it needs to be accessible to anyone regardless of their technical abilities,” said Upol Ehsan, Ph.D. student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech and lead researcher.

CS Majors Helping Automate a Safe Return to In-person Work and School
A new automated tool that uses the latest Covid-19 health and safety research is on track to help organizations plan and implement a safe return to in-person work and school amid the pandemic.
Called Rotations, the web-based platform was selected on Jan. 28 as the winning concept for Hack Covid-19, a student hackathon organized by Emory Global Health Institute and Georgia Tech. The winning team includes two Georgia Tech computer science (CS) majors.
Rotations is an automated schedule generator that helps mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in shared workspaces. According to its developers, the tool uses current health and safety data to auto-generate schedules, as well as suggested seating layouts, optimized to keep returning in-person employees and students safe.
“We put ourselves in the place of an office manager or school administrator and asked, ‘What kind of tool could make returning to in-person functions as easy as possible and how could we minimize the spread of the virus as much as possible at the same time?’” said Arvin Poddar, Rotations team member and third-year Georgia Tech CS major.
The schedules and seating charts output by the platform are customizable based on variables unique to a particular workspace. These can include a maximum number of people, square footage of a room, ventilation, and other factors. These data points are also used to calculate a safety score that integrates available research resources.
“We are trying to change the game by looking at the research and seeing how floor layouts can truly be optimized with data,” said Merissa Coleman, team member and a third-year human health major from Emory University.
Another feature that helps mitigate the spread of the virus is the platform’s ability to automatically stagger arrival times for in-person employees. This helps to minimize contact and ensure proper social distancing. If someone does report contracting Covid-19, the platform has a contact tracing function that will automatically alert all of those that were in recent contact with that person.
“We wanted the product to be applicable to both management and employees. So, along with being easy to use, we wanted to be able to give peace of mind to those returning to the office and the classroom,” said Coleman.
As the winners of the Hack Covid-19 competition, Coleman, Poddar, and teammate Ryan Cobelli – also a Georgia Tech CS major – receive a $3,500 cash prize and earn a spot in the CREATE-X Startup Launch program this summer. CREATE-X is Georgia Tech’s entrepreneurial accelerator for students that helps develop projects like Rotations into business startups.
“As we know, Covid is changing every day and the situation is evolving. So, we are really looking forward to developing this product into something that people can really use,” said Poddar.
A primary feature that the team would like to develop while participating in the Startup Launch program is direct integration of the Rotations tool. Being able to directly connect with systems that schools and businesses already use will do away with the current need for administrators to manually upload .csv files to develop rosters.
Beyond this, Poddar sees potential for even more integration with existing systems.
“Ultimately, maybe Rotations doesn’t even need to be its own stand-alone platform. Maybe it could be directly integrated into an existing HR system or learning management platform,” said Poddar.

From the Dean's Desk - Aug. 18, 2020
Dear GT Computing community,
I am pleased to note that Vivek Sarkar has officially taken over as the chair of the School of Computer Science as of this week. With Haesun Park in place as chair of Computational Science and Engineering as of last week, we now have our full slate of school leadership in place. Also, not for nothing, but I am very pleased to note that out of our four schools and divisions, three are now headed by women. The College is modeling what it means to create excellence by bringing together a diverse group of leaders, something we know we need across our entire field.
I would like once again to thank Srinivas Aluru and Mostafa Ammar for serving as interim chairs for CSE and SCS for the past year. I would say that we will miss their leadership, but we have nothing to worry about there. Srinivas will continue in his role as Executive Director of IDEAS, and Mostafa is sticking around to help the College launch our new School for Cybersecurity and Privacy. He will be working with Mustaque Ahamad and Wenke Lee, as well as other faculty across the Institute, to help build SCP in preparation for the day it fully opens its doors.
On a more prosaic note, I want to remind everyone who comes into campus to pick up their Institute-provided PPE, namely two masks and a personal refillable bottle of hand sanitizer. The locations for each building are as follows:
- Coda: Floor 12E, Coda Support Services Team. Please call (404) 374-7378 and wait outside the of the CSS glass doors for service.
- CCB: CCB Mailroom 033
- Klaus: CCB Mailroom 033
- TSRB: Cori Wilson, Room 211
There have been some other changes to our operations now that we have students back on campus; please consult our business continuity webpage for updates on building access, deliveries, facilities and mail.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - Aug. 3, 2021
There are so many things going on as we prepare to work our way back to campus.
First off, let me thank all the folks crafting return-to-campus plans. We seem to be converging on a reasonable starting place, and that’s happening because of everyone working together thoughtfully.
Speaking of back to campus, you may have seen a note from President Cabrera in your e-mail inbox recently. He has asked that everyone consider wearing a mask while on campus. Please note that this is not a mask mandate: because GT is a state entity, the belief is that we are not subject to the City of Atlanta’s mask mandate. I’m not sure where this is all going to end up, but the conversations are ongoing. In the meantime, I would like to echo the President and encourage you to be thoughtful about wearing a mask. Stay informed and aware as facts are changing on the ground day by day.
Oh! I know I sent a dispatch about the new NSF AI institutes last week, but for more context, I encourage you to read President Cabrera’s message to alumni about AI at Georgia Tech. There’s a bit of CoC history (I’m looking at you Ron) and a description of the bright future ahead.
In other good news, our own Srinivas Aluru has been named editor-in-chief of the journal IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. His appointment will start on August 1 and run through December 2024. Please join me in congratulating Srinivas for his intellectual leadership.
Finally, I’d like to mention Highcharts Sonification Studio, Bruce Walker’s (IC) new open-source tool for the sonification of charts. This research makes it possible to listen to data as well as look at it, which, um, sounds amazing. It is clearly beneficial to everyone and a real boon to those with visual impairments.
So there you go. There’s a week and a semester ahead of us. Take some time to stomp your feet, shake your groove thing, or, you know what?, do the conga. Or do what I’m going to try to do sometime this century and just rest. I shall see you before too long.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - July 13, 2021
Dear GT Computing community,
It’s July, and that means it’s beginning to feel like summer. It’s July 2021, and that means we’re coming up on the long-awaited return to campus. I’d like to take a moment to talk a little bit about how that will likely look. Of course, the details will vary from group to group and person to person, but we can see the outline for the rest of the year.
First, there’s the timing. Classes begin for the Fall semester on Monday, August 23. This is the key date around which most of our plans must revolve. In particular, the students will be fully back on campus studenting. As such, all of us across the entire campus have to plan to engage fully with them by then. Some of us will have to engage even before then in order to prepare for their arrival. Actually, many of us are on campus now (quite literally today) managing our once-again-in-person FASET meetings with parents and new students.
Second, I think we all know work will look a little different this Fall and it will continue to evolve over the rest of the year. Just as with timing, how we return to campus will likely look different for different groups. I am empowering different offices and supervisors across the College to create plans for their teams consistent with what we know is allowed by GT and USG rules. Our goal is to be at least as—and even more—flexible than we were pre-COVID on the one hand but to also make sure that our plans for each team across the College allows us to serve our constituents even more effectively and efficiently. Online and virtual services are wonderful, but they absolutely mean that more, not fewer, will take advantage of these services. We need each group to think deeply about what you do and how best to be effective in this new environment.
Finally, I’d like to reiterate the Institute’s rules around masking and social distancing. Outside of labs, no one can require another person to wear a mask. You may not put up signs asking visitors to your offices or spaces to wear masks. Now, it may be within your good judgment to wear a mask yourself, and if so I encourage you to do so. But we must follow Institute rules on this matter.
And there we go. We have a little bit of thought and effort ahead of us, but I believe that if we work together we’ll end up in a better place for everyone in the GT family eventually.
Oh, before I let you go, I would like to share that one of our graduates, Andrea Fletcher (BS CS ’16), has been profiled in the Wall Street Journal, talking about her dream career working for Roblox. As we all work through our worries about going back to work, let us remember that we are making dreams come true. It’s worth it.
So keep that difference you make in the lives of so many in mind for the next month or year or decade or so. And for now, enjoy the weather, get out and play, see your friends and family. Be safe. I’ll see you soon.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - July 20, 2021
Dear GT Computing community,
I’ve got some good news today. Georgia Tech has just been rated #5 globally for computer science research by Guide2Research.com.
Now, there are a lot of rankings out there, but this one is particularly interesting because it’s based on our collective h-index. For those who don’t know, the h-index is a measurement that tracks how much a researcher publishes and (importantly) how many other researchers are citing their work. It is a kind of shorthand for our intellectual influence.
As we all know, rankings are useless, except the ones I like, and I like this one because it shows that the research we do here is influential.
In other good news, the College of Computing has three alumni on this year's 40 under 40 list:
- Mahdi Al-Husseini (MS CS '20), an aeromedical evacuations officer for the U.S. Army who also develops technology and policy for aviation safety.
- Vanessa Larco (BS CS '08), venture capitalist and founding member of LatinXVC, a group to help Latinos enter venture capitalism.
- Dhawal Shah (MS CS '10), CEO of Class Central, a website that has matched more than 40 million users to online education programs.
Finally, I’m starting to hear from teams across the College who are formulating their work plans for fall. Please continue working with your supervisors as they fill out the details.
So there you go. Have a good week. Find some time to take it easy. Take a moment and go for a drive, spend time with your friends and your family. I’ll see you back here next week. I have to go catch a plane.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - July 27, 2021
Dear GT Computing community,
It’s the last day of summer classes, and we are all turning our attention to the fall semester, and to our return to campus.
I’m sure everyone is working with their supervisors to hammer out their work arrangements for the fall. As is always the case, different groups have different needs and different responsibilities, so plans may be a little different from one group to another; however, I do expect some strong commonalities:
- Fall classes start on August 23, so plan to “start” next month, probably close to August 16 for most of us.
- In the Before Times(tm) we were allowed one work-from-home day a week as a default, and I expect most of us will be able to see that rise to two as a default. For some, that increase will not work out (just as one day a week did not for every group). Some will be able to make an extraordinarily good case showing that more remote work will improve productivity.
- Things happen, so I expect each team to have on-campus coverage every day.
No matter where we end up, these plans must reflect what’s best for each group and will require that as groups we will work together to make the right thing happen. Speaking of where we end up, this is just the first step. I very much expect that both CoC and the Institute will be able to revisit these plans before the end of the year as we figure out what works, and put in the infrastructure to help us to work better, remotely or otherwise.
I know the return to campus can be a source of uncertainty and irritation, but we’ll figure it out. More importantly, it’s not all uncertainty and irritation. I suspect many of you are very happy at the thought that we will be together again. I know I am. In fact, we are planning a year of celebration with events, T-shirts and more. Our theme is the Power of Two, capturing what we can accomplish when we come together to pursue our common goals. We have shown that power through the last year, pulling together through crisis after crisis, and I want to celebrate how that energy will carry us to new heights moving forward. More on the nerdy future events later.
In the meantime, let me end by noting that our own Andrea Grimes Parker (SIC) is co-PI on a $2.4 million grant to develop a virtual health counselor called Clara. Clara is designed to address vaccine hesitancy and will be piloted in 12 Black churches in Boston. Please join me in thanking Andrea for her intellectual leadership, and for her work using technology for the public good.
That’s all for today. Have a good week, and make sure you take some time to relax. Head out to the country, or into the city, or just stay home and relax. I shall see you here next week.
Peace.

Sonia Chernova (SIC) is the PI and Beth Mynatt is the co-PI of the NSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups (AI-CARING). The AI-CARING institute aims to develop new longitudinal, collaborative AI systems that work with aging adults, including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and their caregivers.
Both of these Institutes build on decades of our research, and both will not only create novel technologies but also train a new generation of researchers. Here in the College of Computing, we strive to build new technologies that improve the human condition, and these Institutes embody that ethos to a T (stolen by the students or otherwise).
Please join me in congratulating Sonia, Beth and Ashok for their intellectual leadership. Congratulations also to Pascal Van Hentenryck of ISyE, who is the PI for the NSF AI Institute for Advances in Optimization (AI4Opt).
These grants, $60 million in total, rest on literal decades of work on AI, aging, and education in the College. They are also at the leading edge of a new wave of investment in AI at Georgia Tech. We are expected to hire 100 new AI researchers in the field over the next few years. CoC is also investing not only in faculty but in graduate fellowships and in new courses teaching AI as a tool for science and engineering.
I couldn’t be more proud of our achievements in AI, and I can’t wait to see what this expansion allows us to do next. We’ve got a lot to celebrate, so enjoy the good times and I will see you back here next week.
Peace.

Dear GT Computing community,
It’s a beautiful day here in Atlanta, and the birds are out singing to celebrate a new fiscal year and the great renewal that comes with it. I’m going to join our avian colleagues and talk today about some changes we are making in the College in order to build on our past successes and set us up for the future. In short, we are expanding and restructuring our Office of Outreach, Enrollment, and Community.
As you know, one of the key strengths of the College is its community. Our community is broad: it includes students, faculty, staff, and alumni, but also those who are joining the field of computing through our outreach efforts. For more than a decade, OEC has spearheaded and supported many of these community efforts. Sometimes quite visibly, sometimes quietly, but always with energy and passion.
OEC has grown dramatically just as our community has grown, and just as the importance of computing has grown. To manage this growth and to increase our impact, we are strengthening all parts of OEC:
- Our corporate and alumni support operations will join the Office of Development. We have partnered with the GT Alumni Association to focus on our young alumni especially and to formalize the pilot programs we have started in the last two years.
- Many of our various internal community, wellness, and enrichment programs will come together in an organization that will report up through Irfan Essa, our Senior Associate Dean.
- Similarly, our many outreach programs in OEC and Constellations will also come together. This restructuring will consolidate the logistical and organizational support that touches so many of our efforts across the College. One important consequence is that the event coordinators from OEC and Communications will come together into a college-level event management group.
All in all, these developments are good for the College and the amazing folks who have worked on these efforts. They will set up for our next wave of growth (I say next but it’s already here) and support our strategic goals, including our focus on increasing the diversity of and access to the field of computing at every stage in the pipeline. The new outreach group will strengthen and add to our existing programs for diversifying the field, which is good for us and for the larger community.
While we’re on the subject of renewal, I have another somewhat mixed announcement to make: Brad Hastings, our exceptional Senior Director of Development, has agreed to serve as the Executive Director of Development for the College of Engineering going forward. That’s good news for CoE but, well, let’s just say I have a few other feelings as well. Having said that, Brad has graciously agreed to continue in his role with CoC for the foreseeable future while we transition to the upcoming campaign.
So there you go. Please enjoy the week ahead. Take some time to sing a song, to dance like no one’s watching (because as I cannot emphasize enough no one is), or just to enjoy the morning sun. I’ll see you again soon, maybe even in person.
Peace.

From the Dean's Desk - June 1, 2020
I’ve thought a lot about it since, but at the time all I could think was: “That’s a really big gun.”
I was at a capital-T Traffic Stop somewhere outside of Cambridge, MA. A police officer was approaching me on the driver’s side and for some reason he went for his gun and yelled at me to be still. I got… stiller… and eventually it was all over and I drove away.
Only later, while trying to calm down my friends did I think, “He could have killed me”.
I’m not sure exactly when that changed to “…and he would have gotten away with it”. I think it was April 29, 1992. That was a day much like the days we’re experiencing now.
In the many years since, my thoughts have returned to that night. They became “…and would anyone have heard about it?” They became, “…and if they did what would they have heard?” Would the reports say I led a high speed chase? Would the pundits say that if only I’d complied, I’d be alive? What would they have dredged up? Maybe somehow that time in seventh grade when I checked out Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret from the library would be held against me.
I don’t know, but it would have been something, and it would be like dying twice.
It’s not always the Traffic Stop. Sometimes I think about the time that guy in the pick up truck spit on me, or the confrontation with the police while I was house hunting. A few weeks ago, I was sitting on a curb in my embarrassingly sprawling neighborhood and someone in a truck drove by, stopped maybe 40 yards away, backed up and stared at me for five or six seconds, then left. “What was that about? What could it have been about?”
My son is 12, all arms and legs. Studies tell me that when he walks down the street, he’ll be more likely mistaken for 16. His 12-year old movements will be threatening. I know: I’ve already had that conversation with teachers.
Yesterday, I sat in my car with him and we talked about what’s going on, and this is neither the first nor second such conversation. He doesn’t quite believe what’s happening, but he believes it more every time we have this conversation. I know he’ll believe it more the next time we are here, the next time someone utters a racial epithet around him. This is a reality I went through, and I know it’s a reality he’ll go through.
My thoughts nowadays are more about him. He’s one candy bar away from “Gun!” and being shot. He’s a moment away from “He should have complied” and “He was no saint” and whatever else they would say. It wouldn’t be true, not this boy who interrupts my meetings to hug me and ask me if he can have apple juice, but I know it would be said.
Of course, I think about other things. In so many ways, my life is great… and I have a lot to do, so I go back to the business of getting through my life and resigning myself to the fact that I really do have to do my taxes this weekend. But the thoughts always come back.
You know what I’m thinking now? As I write this, I’m sitting in my office and I’m looking out at my city. I can see the campus, I can see midtown and downtown, buildings poking out above all the many trees. But I don’t see smoke. I don’t see broken windows. I don’t see all the stories out there. I know that right over there two college kids from Spelman and Morehouse were dragged from their car and tased during the demonstrations this weekend, and I’m sure there are other stories, and some of them probably ended even worse. I know most of them were never recorded, never noted by the public.
I don’t see your story either, but I know you have one. We all do. That’s mostly what I think about at times like these. Everyone has a story. I may not see yours any more than you see mine, but I know you have one.
In the end it’s what binds us together. We all have stories and as often as not they are similar in some important way. It’s how we know we are human together.
And when they are different? Well that’s even more important. Those differences also tell us about each other, even when they are so different that they seem hard to imagine.
Either way, these stories make us the community we are. It is, simply, fundamentally true. And when we realize it, we can change things. It really doesn’t have to be the way it’s always been. We can make it better as a community. In fact, we must.
Look, it’s been a long few weeks, and a very long weekend. Please, stay safe. I’d like to hear you tell your story one day.
Peace.

Students who wish to pursue a Master's degree in Bioengineering may do so through the College of Computing. The specific requirements differ from those of the computer science master's program, and while the degree is granted from the College, applications for this program are processed through Georgia Tech's Bioengineering Center in the Office of Interdisciplinary Programs.
Visit the MS Bioengineering degree website for program details.
Master of Science in Computational Science & Engineering - Distance Learning
The CSE master's degree program includes an option to take most courses through Georgia Tech Professional Education. Students do not need to physically reside on the Atlanta campus while taking coursework through Professional Education.
Students must register as an "online student" in semesters when taking one or more courses, and all courses taken during those semesters should be courses through Professional Education. In other words, one cannot take some courses on campus and others through Professional Education during the same semester.
Students should carefully evaluate the course offerings provided through Georgia Tech Professional Education before applying as an online student. While most courses with a CSE course designation are offered through Professional Education, many specialization courses are only offered on campus.
The CSE program handbook includes information concerning specific specialization courses that have been offered through Professional Education in the past (see the appendices in the handbook listing specialization courses). Prospective students may wish to consult with a CSE program advisor to determine if a specific set of courses may be used to fulfill M.S. CSE degree requirements.
Master of Science in Computer Science
Graduates receive the MSCS for completing one of three options in the program as described in the program of study. The program is designed for students who possess a bachelor's degree in computer science from an accredited institution. Students with a bachelor's degree in other than computer science are encouraged to apply as well, with the understanding that they may be required to complete remedial course work in addition to the requirements of the M.S. CS degree.
Admissions
Admission to the program is highly selective; there are many more qualified applicants than there are places in the program. The challenge for the College every year is to select a class from a highly qualified pool. The College looks for compelling reasons to admit candidates, and the statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, test scores and GPA are all reviewed carefully. Having a strong undergraduate background in computer science, including C programming, is highly recommended for applicants. The Admissions Committee welcomes additional pertinent information that will aid in making objective and informed decisions.
Students are admitted to the master's program only once a year. The application deadline is Feb. 1 for admission to the following fall semester.
Learn important information about our admissions process on our Admissions Requirements page.

Program of Study
The degree requires 36 credit hours, which are taken over four semesters. All students take the same core courses, a set of courses related to their chosen specialization (Computing, Digital Media in LMC, Industrial Design, Psychology), a broader set of electives and complete a master’s project. Students complete an internship in the summer after their first year of study.
Elective courses can be in a wide variety of areas, such as Architecture, Music Technology, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Computer Science, Human-Robot Interaction, Human Factors, Management of Technology and Cognitive Science. Students can earn the Management of Technology Certificate from the College of Management.
More than 50 faculty work in these and closely-related areas, and are associated with research labs and centers such as the GVU Center, the Institute for People and Technology, the Aware Home, the Interactive Media Technology Center, the Sonification Lab, GTRI and many more.

This 36 credit-hour, cohort-based program is a professional Master of Science in Robotics over four semesters designed to produce industry-ready engineers and scientists with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills needed to meet the challenges of rapidly growing interdisciplinary technologies in professional careers related to designing and developing robotics and automation solutions. Such a program is in high demand by not only students but also a growing list of local and global companies interested in robotics and factory automation.
The MS Robotics program provides its graduates with a practitioner-oriented degree that clearly distinguishes them as trained professionals in the field. Its curriculum is specifically tailored to the educational needs for robotics professionals by requiring courses in multiple core areas of Robotics (e.g., AI and Mechanics). In addition to coursework, the students will spend a summer performing internship at one of our industrial robotics partners, and complete a capstone project providing them with practical experience directly applicable to their careers.
How to Apply
The MS-Robotics program is offered collaboratively by six schools in the Colleges of Computing, Engineering and Sciences:
- Electrical & Computer Engineering
- Mechanical Engineering
- Aerospace Engineering
- Biomedical Engineering
- Interactive Computing
- Physics
Students can apply to the MS-Robotics program through any of the six participating schools, the choice of which usually reflects that student's intended area of specialization and general background. Students with diverse and eclectic backgrounds are encouraged to apply, including those with previous work or research experience. Each school has its own set of admission criteria but the program generally requires a minimum GPA of 3.3.
Program of Study
The program requires 36 hours of letter-grade coursework with a minimum GPA of 3.0. A maximum of two classes (6 semester hours) at the 4000 level (undergraduate) may be used as free electives toward the required 36 credit hours.

M.S. Computational Science and Engineering
Georgia Tech’s interdisciplinary Master of Science degree in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) is devoted to the creation, study, and application of computer-based models of natural and engineered systems. M.S. CSE graduates are exceptionally prepared for careers in industry, government, and academia.
The program is offered with the option to take portions, or in some instances, all of the coursework off-campus via Georgia Tech Professional Education.
The curriculum has been structured to impart students with solid CSE foundational knowledge and skills. It includes technical specialization courses that enhance a student's domain expertise. Advanced elective courses will enable students to specialize in a domain and technical expertise focusing on their particular interests. The optional thesis portion of the program requires the completion of an interdisciplinary research project.
Admissions Requirements
Interested in applying for the M.S. CSE program? Submit an application through Georgia Tech admissions and be sure to designate a home unit.
Keep in mind:
- Most students entering the CSE graduate degree programs will have obtained a bachelor's degree in a technical field, e.g., computer science, mathematics, or a science or engineering discipline.
- Students should have taken undergraduate calculus courses. Some CSE courses will require additional coursework in topics such as linear algebra or differential equations.
- Working knowledge of probability and statistics will also be helpful in some core courses and specializations.
- Students should have taken at least one course, but preferably two, and have developed a proficiency in programming in a high-level language such as C, FORTRAN or Java.
- Students deficient in one or more of these areas may still gain admission but should expect to take some additional coursework.

Program of Study
If you are interested in applying into the Ph.D. in CSE program, the program of study information will inform you of the hours and course-load required to complete the program.
CSE Qualifying Examination
This examination is designed to ensure the student has achieved sufficient knowledge in core areas of computational science and engineering as well as in their chosen specialization area as preparation for advanced research.
- Written qualifying exam: This written exam encompasses core areas of Computational Science and Engineering. Students select two areas among numerical methods, discrete algorithms, modeling and simulation, computational data analysis, and high performance computing. Material covered by the examination will normally include topics covered in core courses in the core area augmented with a reading list provided to the student as preparation for the examination. The format is a day-long written examination.
- Specialization exam and artifact defense: This portion of the exam has two purposes: to ensure that the student has acquired sufficient knowledge in his/her specialization area in a computing, engineering or science discipline for advanced research, and to ensure that the student can demonstrate an ability to integrate knowledge in mathematical foundations/computational methods and knowledge in a specific engineering or science discipline to synthesize a concrete computational artifact, e.g., a significant computer program. Specifics concerning the specialization exam and artifact defense depend on the home unit.
The qualifying exam must be attempted by the end of the second year of enrollment in the CSE doctoral program and in some home units the exam must be passed by the end of the second year. Please refer to the CSE graduate student handbook for detailed information.
CSE Doctoral Dissertation
The doctoral dissertation (thesis) forms a central component of the CSE Ph.D. program. Students must demonstrate the ability to perform independent research in collaboration with a faculty advisor that can be defended to a committee of faculty. To complete the doctoral thesis, students must complete three principal milestones: the Ph.D. proposal defense, the Ph.D. dissertation, and the Ph.D. dissertation defense.
Ph.D. in Computer Science
All students in the program receive the same degree regardless of their interest area, specialization, research focus or school affiliation. New students are affiliated with the school in which their advisor resides, but none of the schools impose any special requirements compared to another.
As a research-oriented degree, the Ph.D. in Computer Science prepares exceptional students for careers at the cutting edge of academia, industry and government. Students are expected to demonstrate excellence in both defining and executing a substantial research project that forms a novel contribution to the state of the art in computing. With a highly individualized program of study, the degree provides students with depth in their chosen research area coupled with a rigorous breadth of knowledge across the discipline.
First granting the doctoral degree in 1969 (as a Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science), the College of Computing represents a continuation of one of the earliest and most well-established graduate Computing institutions in the United States, and in the world. This stature is reflected in our national and international rankings and, most importantly, in the quality of the students who have graduated from our program.
The CS Ph.D. Structure
The coursework component of the Computer Science Ph.D. consists of an introductory course on graduate studies (CS 7001), along with the separate breadth and minor requirements.
The breadth requirement is intended to give students a broad competency across the discipline of computing through coursework in a range of the College's different research areas. This requirement is satisfied by taking five classes from across the College's different research areas and must include a Programming Proficiency course and a Theory course.
The minor is a 9-hour sequence of courses from outside the College that constitutes a coherent program of study and is determined by the student and advisor. The minor builds non-Computing expertise in an area related to the student's core research area.
As students progress, they must select a primary area of research and pass a qualifier (comprehensive exam) in that area to demonstrate mastery of the field in their chosen area, and readiness to do research.
While coursework plays an important role in the Ph.D., by far the most important component of the degree is the student's individual dissertation research project. This project should contribute to new knowledge in the field of computing, and should demonstrate the student's proficiency in defining and executing a compelling research agenda.
The dissertation research plan is formalized in a written proposal followed by an oral presentation. When a student passes his or her proposal, the student is admitted to candidacy and proceeds with the dissertation research, which is completed with the successful defense and submission of the approved doctoral dissertation.

NLP Seminar: Addressing Biases for Robust, Generalizable AI
Speaker: Swabha Swayamdipta
Time: 02/12/2021, 12.30pm - 1.30pm

Title: Addressing Biases for Robust, Generalizable AI
Abstract:
Artificial Intelligence has made unprecedented progress in the past decade. However, there still remains a large gap between the decision-making capabilities of humans and machines. In this talk, I will investigate two factors to explain why. First, I will discuss the presence of undesirable biases in datasets, which ultimately hurt generalization. I will then present bias mitigation algorithms that boost the ability of AI models to generalize to unseen data. Second, I will explore task-specific prior knowledge which aids robust generalization, but is often ignored when training modern AI architectures. Throughout this discussion, I will focus my attention on language applications, and will show how certain underlying structures can provide useful biases for inferring meaning in natural language. I will conclude with a discussion of how the broader framework of dataset and model biases will play a critical role in the societal impact of AI, going forward.
Bio:
Swabha Swayamdipta is a postdoctoral investigator at the Allen Institute for AI, working with Yejin Choi. Her research focuses on natural language processing, where she explores dataset and linguistic structural biases, and model interpretability.

SCP/SCS Seminar Talk: Aayush Jain
TITLE: Provably Secure Indistinguishability Obfuscation
ABSTRACT:
In this talk, we will cover some exciting progress on the problem of Indistinguishability Obfuscation (proposed by Barak et. al. 2001). In a nutshell, an Indistinguishability Obfuscation scheme is an efficient compiler that takes as input a program and outputs a new program with the same input-behavior and only a polynomial slowdown, but in addition, we have the guarantee that the new program reveals minimal information about the original program.
If realized securely and efficiently, such an obfuscation scheme would have huge consequences to both theory and practice. However, until now we did not know if it exists under any reasonably well-believed conjecture. Our work places iO onto “terra-firma”, by giving a construction that is as secure as several well-studied mathematical problems that are widely believed to be extremely hard to solve.
In this talk, we will hear about indistinguishability obfuscation, why it is useful, how it can be constructed, and future work.
BIO:
Aayush Jain is a final year Ph.D. student, advised by Amit Sahai at UCLA. He is interested in research questions in cryptography and their wonderful connections with related areas in computer science.
His most notable contribution is the first construction of Program Obfuscation whose security rests upon four well-studied hard problems. This problem was widely considered to be one of the most consequential open problems in cryptography. His work on this problem has been the subject of an invited tutorial at FOCS 2020, an article in Quanta magazine, and a Simons Institute Workshop. His research is recognized by a Google PhD Fellowship (2018-present), a Dean’s Fellowship (2016), and the 2020 Symantec Outstanding Graduate Research Award at UCLA.

Title: Big Data is Low Rank
Abstract: Data scientists are often faced with the challenge of understanding a high dimensional data set organized as a table. These tables may have columns of different (sometimes, non-numeric) types, and often have many missing entries. In this talk, we discuss how to use low rank models to analyze these big messy data sets.
Low rank models perform well --- indeed, suspiciously well — across a wide range of data science applications, including applications in social science, medicine, and machine learning. In this talk, we introduce the mathematics of low rank models, demonstrate a few surprising applications of low rank models in data science, and present a simple mathematical explanation for their effectiveness.
Bio: Madeleine Udell is Assistant Professor of Operations Research and Information Engineering and Richard and Sybil Smith Sesquicentennial Fellow at Cornell University. She studies optimization and machine learning for large scale data analysis and control, with applications in marketing, demographic modeling, medical informatics, engineering system design, and automated machine learning. She has received several awards, including an NSF CAREER award (2020), an Office of Naval Research (ONR) Young Investigator Award (2020), and an INFORMS Optimization Society Best Student Paper Award (as advisor) (2019).

SCS Seminar Talk: Alberto Dainotti
TITLE: Detecting and Visualizing Internet Failures: From Measurements to Streaming Analytics
ABSTRACT:
Our society's dependence on the internet is unquestioned. Yet our ability to manage the risks associated with relying on the proper functioning of the internet's core infrastructure is hindered by a poor understanding of how it can fail. For example, we lack a thorough understanding of when/where/how/why large connectivity failures happen; or we rely on a global routing system that is extremely vulnerable and we do not know to what extent it is exploited, by whom, and for what purposes. My research tries to address these questions by acquiring empirical evidence (e.g., on network status and misuse) on a global scale and longitudinally.
In this talk I will first describe an approach I developed to gather unprecedented insight into episodes of connectivity disruption, which is based on two intuitions: the opportunity to extract (connectivity liveness) "signals" from so-called "Internet background noise" traffic and the benefit of combining different types of control-plane and data-plane measurements. I then discuss how this inspired me to build a system (IODA,ioda.caida.org) to monitor the Internet for large-scale connectivity outages. IODA can detect Internet outages worldwide within minutes, continuously updating and monitoring hundreds of thousands of time series. IODA serves both as a research testbed and as a public service that provides automatically generated alerts and visualizations. This effort has enabled further research in multiple directions, facilitated interdisciplinary collaborations, and resulted in the engagement of industry, government, and civil society.
I will conclude my talk by briefly discussing my other ongoing and future research efforts to understand and remediate Internet infrastructural issues and weaknesses.

Title: Competitive optimization, statistical inference, and fast solvers
Abstract: In this talk, we will use perspectives from game theory and statistical inference to design simple, novel, and efficient algorithms for classical problems in computational science.
In the first part of the talk, we propose competitive gradient descent (CGD) as a natural generalization of gradient descent to saddle point problems and general zero-sum games. Whereas gradient descent minimizes a local linear approximation at each step, CGD uses the Nash equilibrium of a local bilinear approximation. Explicitly accounting for agent interaction significantly improves the convergence properties, as demonstrated in applications to GANs, reinforcement learning, and computational geometry.
In the second part of the talk, we show that the conditional near-independence properties of smooth Gaussian processes imply the near-sparsity of Cholesky factors of dense kernel matrices. We use this insight to derive simple, fast solvers with state-of-the-art complexity vs. accuracy guarantees for general elliptic differential- and integral equations. Our methods come with rigorous error estimates, are easy to parallelize, and show good performance in practice.
Bio: I am a PhD-candidate in applied and computational mathematics at Caltech, advised by Houman Owhadi. Before coming to Caltech, I obtained my Bachelor’s– and Master’s degrees in mathematics at the University of Bonn. My research combines ideas from game theory, statistical inference, and applied mathematics to solve problems in computational science and engineering.

SCS Seminar Talk: Kexin Rong
TITLE: Prioritizing Computation and Analyst Resources in Large-scale Data Analytics
ABSTRACT:
Data volumes are growing exponentially, fueled by an increased number of automated processes such as sensors and devices. Meanwhile, the computational power available for processing this data – as well as analysts’ ability to interpret it – remain limited. As a result, database systems must evolve to address these new bottlenecks in analytics. In my work, I ask: how can we adapt classic ideas from database query processing to modern compute- and analyst-limited data analytics?In this talk, I will discuss the potential for this kind of systems development through the lens of several practical systems I have developed. By drawing insights from database query optimization, such as pushing workload- and domain-s pecific filtering, aggregation, and sampling into core analytics workflows, we can dramatically improve the efficiency of analytics at scale. I will illustrate these ideas by focusing on two systems — one designed for high-volume seismic waveform analysis and one designed to optimize visualizations for streaming infrastructure and application telemetry — both of which have been field-tested at scale. I will also discuss lessons from production deployments at companies including Datadog, Microsoft, Google and Facebook

Title: Building the Next-Generation AI: Small and Efficient Neural Computing
Abstract:
Deep learning has changed the computing paradigm. Today, AI researchers & practitioners increasingly use deep neural networks for many applications across different modalities and areas such as NLP, Vision, Speech, Conversational and Multimodal AI. However, much of the Deep Learning revolution has been limited to the Cloud and highly specialized hardware. Recently the AI community has witnessed an increasing trend for training larger and larger neural models (e.g., GPT-3, T5, BERT) that achieve state-of-the-art results but require enormous computation, memory and energy resources on the Cloud. In order to enable AI experiences in real-time across all users and devices, ML models have to run efficiently on the Cloud and personal devices on the Edge (e.g., mobile phones, wearables, IoT) which have limited computing capabilities.
In this talk, I will introduce our work on Neural Projection computing, an efficient AI paradigm, and a family of efficient Projection Neural Network architectures that yield fast (e.g., quadratic speedup for transformer networks) and tiny models that shrink memory requirements by upto 10000x while achieving near state-of-the-art performance powering vision and NLP applications on billions of mobile devices. Widespread increase in availability of connected “smart” appliances (e.g., conversational assistants) means that there is an ever-expanding surface area for mobile intelligence and ambient devices in homes. Our approach enables efficient ML to solve complex prediction tasks for such applications both on-device and on Cloud, keeping model size, compute and power usage low while simultaneously optimizing for accuracy.

Title: Multi-scale Human Behavior Modeling with Heterogeneous Data
Abstract:
In this era of big data, massive data are generated from heterogeneous resources every day, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for deepening our understanding of complex human behaviors. Modeling human behaviors requires robust computational methods that can not only capture semantics and useful insights from sparse and heterogeneous data, but also unravel sophisticated human behaviors at different scales. Besides, the enormous data velocity and the unparalleled scale of deep models also pose significant challenges to efficiency. In this talk, I will demonstrate a collection of research results that systematically improve the ecosystem of human behavior modeling based on representation learning. I will present practical representation learning for heterogeneous data in various settings, and show how these representation learning methods actually fill a niche to comfortably model different behaviors with atomic, compositional, and explainable operations. Finally, I will discuss how the theory of human behaviors may conversely benefit machine learning algorithms.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Krystina Madej -- Bringing Narrative Authoring into Social Media
Abstract:
When social media is perceived only as a vehicle for posting personal history narratives the potential for using its affordances to create literary narratives is lost. We can use social media’s speculative spaces to both create and experience a wide range of interactive and collaborative stories, both non-fiction and fiction. In 2009 The Royal Opera House used Twitter to crowd source Twitterdammerung, a collaborative venture to explore opera as a living art form and make it accessible to everyone. This inspired the Neil Gaiman book Hearts, Keys and Puppetry, a Twitter collaboration published as a BBC Audiobook, also in 2009. In 2014, Grammerly used its blog to crowd-source the book Frozen by Fire from 500 writers in 54 different countries. Crowdsourcing has become common for entertainment platforms such as Netfllix and a new generation of users has higher expectation of helping to shape online stories. High profile narrative experiments notwithstanding, the digital humanities continue to view social media most often as a vehicle for personal histories. This paper presents an ongoing social media and narrative project initiated in 2013 that encourages the broader perspective. It presents social media narratives created in 2019 by small teams of university students who were asked to engage in participatory story creation that used social media in all its affordances. Planning was through social media, content creation was through social media, and the narrative was played out through social media from Instant Messaging to Tweets, from Facebook to LinkedIn, from YouTube to Snap Chat. Students created their own non-fiction narratives (Atlanta Child Murders), explored contemporary fiction (The Handmaid’s Tale), and revisited canonical works (Romeo and Juliet) in ways that reflected their current media culture. One response to Romeo and Juliet shows the value of just such an approach, “I’ve never really connected to the story until now that I’ve seen how it plays out in apps I use every day.”
Speaker Bio:
Dr. Krystina Madej is Professor of the Practice at Georgia Tech in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication. She researches and teaches about how humans have adapted their narratives to changing media throughout the centuries, Disney's approach to stories across media since the 1920s, and physical play and children's interaction with narrative-based digital games. Her books include Interactivity, Collaboration, and Authoring in Social Media, Physical Play and Children’s Digital Games, and the edited book Engaging Imagination and Developing Creativity. A second edition of the co-authored book Disney Stories: Getting to Digital, first published in 2012, was released in November 2020.

SCS Seminar Talk: Ahmed Saeed
TITLE: Building Scalable Networks Stacks for Modern Applications
ABSTRACT:
The network stack in today's operating systems is a remnant from a time when a server had a handful of cores and processed requests from a few thousand clients. It simply cannot keep up with the scale of modern servers and the requirements of modern applications. Specifically, real-time applications and high user expectations enforce strict performance requirements on the infrastructure. Further, there is a fundamental shift in the way hardware capacity scales from simply relying on Moore's law to deliver faster hardware every couple of years to leveraging parallel processing and task-specific accelerators. This talk covers innovations in three key components of the network stack. First, I will cover my work on scalable packet scheduling in software network stacks, improving the control of traffic outgoing from large-scale servers. Second, I will move on to my work on improving overload control for servers handling microsecond-scale remote procedure calls, providing better control over incoming traffic to large-scale servers. Then, the talk covers my work on Wide Area Network (WAN) congestion control, focusing on network-assisted congestion control schemes, where end-to-end solutions fail. The talk will conclude with a discussion of plans for future research in this area.
BIO:
Saeed is a postdoctoral associate at MIT working with Professor Mohammad Alizadeh. His research interests broadly cover the theory, design, and implementation of scalable computer networks and systems, including resource scheduling, congestion control, wireless networks, and cyber-physical systems. Before joining MIT, Saeed received his Ph.D. in computer science from Georgia Tech, where he was advised by Professors Mostafa Ammar and Ellen Zegura. His Ph.D. was partially supported by the Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Systems and Networking. He received his bachelor's degree from Alexandria University in 2010.

SCS Seminar Talk: Praveen Kumar
TITLE: Towards Predictable Networks
ABSTRACT:
Fueled by evolving applications, requirements from systems and networks are changing in fundamental ways: networks today must provide increasingly strict performance guarantees and not just high performance. However, the design principles of the early Internet continue to be the basis of modern networks to provide best-effort performance. This leads to a mismatch between what applications need and what networks provide. To bridge this gap, we need predictability to be built into the design of networks.
In this talk, I will focus on the unique challenges and unprecedented opportunities for building predictable networks. I will first discuss this in the context of shared public clouds by presenting a new abstraction and system, PicNIC, for predictable network performance while navigating fundamental trade-offs. Then, I will expand the discussion with wide-area networks with a system to achieve efficiency and predictability. Finally, I will highlight research directions towards leveraging hardware support to build predictable networks in a scalable, robust, and efficient manner.
BIO:
Praveen Kumar is a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Cornell University. His research focuses on building predictable networks and takes a multi-disciplinary approach spanning architecture, PL, systems, and theory to build holistic networking solutions — from low-level hardware to high-level abstractions and algorithms. Kumar’s systems have been deployed at scale and also influenced the design of several other systems in production. His work has been recognized with a SIGCOMM best student paper award.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Kurtis Heimerl — Reclaiming the Internet: A Journey to Community-Held Cellular Infrastructure
Abstract:
Mobile network operators (MNOs) are a critical component of today’s Internet access landscape. Originally borne of wireline voice telephony access, innovations in wireless data connectivity (such as GPRS and LTE) have enabled these operators to become the world's dominant Internet providers, connecting more people to the Internet than wireline networks. However, the increasing centralization of the MNO ecosystem (down to just three providers in the US) is in contrast to the general design goals of the internet, which was built to allow multiple regional autonomous systems to work together to provide connectivity. In this talk we will discuss my group's ongoing attempts to leverage advances in wide area technology, specific open source LTE and NR, to recreate distributed access networks and help small organizations provide connectivity to their communities while still achieving the at-scale efficiencies of modern MNOs. This journey starts with an MNO partnership for GSM networks in the rural Philippines and continues in our current work with local NGOs on urban NR infrastructure.
Speaker Bio:
Kurtis Heimerl is an assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Washington working on Information and Communication Technology and International Development (ICTD), specifically universal Internet access. Before that, he received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, working under Professors Eric Brewer and Tapan Parikh. Kurtis cofounded Endaga, which joined Facebook in 2015 and has also published widely, including top conferences such as ICTD, CSCW, CHI, MobiCom, and NSDI. He was a recipient of the 2014 MIT “35 under 35” award, the 2018 UW early career Diamond Award, and has won paper awards at CHI, NSDI, COMPASS, ASSETS, and DySPAN.

SCS Seminar Talk: Manuel Rigger
TITLE: Robustifying Data-Centric Systems
ABSTRACT:
Data is eating the world. Systems for storing and processing data, such as database
management systems (DBMSs), are thus pivotal for our computing infrastructure. It is critical
that they function correctly — incorrectly computed results (e.g., by omitting a row) can cause
serious loss or damage. Despite their importance, finding such logic bugs in production DBMSs is a longstanding challenge. This talk presents novel, general approaches to effectively detecting logic bugs in DBMSs by tackling the test oracle problem, i.e., deciding whether the returned result for a query is correct. These approaches were realized as the SQLancer open-source tool, which was evaluated on widely-used, production-quality DBMSs, such as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. To date, SQLancer has found over 450 unique previously unknown bugs in these systems, most of which have been fixed by the developers. This body of work has provided solid methodological and technical bases for effectively testing DBMSs and has already been widely adopted by industry. Many reliability challenges remain, not only for DBMSs, but also for other data-centric systems. The heterogeneous landscape in this space provides an exciting, fertile ground for new, practically relevant research for improving the reliability and performance of our society’s data processing infrastructure
BIO:
Manuel Rigger is a postdoctoral researcher in the Advanced Software Technologies (AST)
Lab at ETH Zurich, mentored by Zhendong Su. His research goal is to make software more
reliable by developing practical and principled approaches to tackle important challenges related to correctness, performance, and security. He draws on and contributes to the software engineering, systems, programming languages, and compilers fields. His recent work has focused on automatically testing database management systems, and led to over 450 unique bugs in widely-used systems such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, TiDB, and CockroachDB being discovered, most of which have been fixed. He completed his Ph.D. at Johannes Kepler University Linz, mentored by Hanspeter Mössenböck, and worked on the safe and efficient execution of unsafe languages (project Sulong). Part of this work was integrated into Oracle’s GraalVM to support its execution of LLVM IR.

SCS Seminar Talk: Caroline Lemieux
TITLE: Expanding the Reach of Fuzzing
ABSTRACT:
Software bugs are pervasive in modern software. As software is integrated into increasingly many aspects of our lives, these bugs have increasingly severe consequences, both from a security (e.g. Cloudbleed, Heartbleed, Shellshock) and cost standpoint. Fuzzing refers to a set of techniques that automatically find bug-triggering inputs by sending many random-looking inputs to the program under test. In this talk, I will discuss how, by identifying core under-generalized components of modern fuzzing algorithms, and building algorithms that generalize or tune these components, I have expanded the application domains of fuzzing. First, by building a general feedback-directed fuzzing algorithm, I enabled fuzzing to consistently find performance and resource consumption errors. Second, by developing techniques to maintain structure during mutation, I brought fuzzing exploration to “deeper” program states. Third, by decoupling the user-facing abstraction of random input generators from their sampling distributions, I built faster validity fuzzing and even tackled program synthesis. Finally, I will discuss the key research problems that must be tackled to make fuzzing readily-available and useful to all developers.
BIO:
Caroline Lemieux is a final-year Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley, advised by Koushik Sen. Her research aims to help developers improve the correctness, security, and performance of large, existing software systems, ranging from complex open-source projects to industrial-scale software. Her current projects tackle these goals with a focus on fuzz testing and program synthesis. Her work on fuzz testing has been awarded an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award, ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Artifact Award, ACM SIGSOFT Tool Demonstration Award, and Best Paper Award (Industry Track). Before Berkeley, she received her B.Sc. in combined honours computer science and mathematics at the University of British Columbia, where she won the Governor General’s Silver Medal in Science (highest standing in the Faculty of Science). She is the recipient of a Berkeley Fellowship for Graduate Study and a Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Programming Technologies and Software Engineering.

ML@GT Virtual Seminar: Csaba Szepesvari, University of Alberta
ML@GT invites you to a virtual seminar featuring Csaba Szepesvari from the University of Alberta. Please check back soon for additional information
Hardness of MDP planning with linear function approximation
Markov decision processes (MDPs) is a minimalist framework to capture that many tasks require long-term plans and feedback due to noisy dynamics. Yet, as a result MDPs lack structure and as such planning and learning in MDPs with the typically enormous state and action spaces is strongly intractable; no algorithm can avoid Bellman's curse of dimensionality in the worst case. However, as recognized already by Bellman and his co-workers at the advent of our field, for many problem of practical interest, the optimal value function of an MDP is well approximated by just using a few basis functions, such as those that are standardly used in numerical calculations. As knowing the optimal value function is essentially equivalent to knowing how to act optimally, one hopes that this observation can be turned into efficient algorithms as there are only a few coefficients to compute. If this is possible, we can think of the resulting algorithms as performing computations with a compressed form of the value functions. While many algorithms have been proposed as early as in the 1960s, until recently not much has been known about whether these compressed computations are possible and when. In this talk, I will discuss a few recent results (some positive, some negative) that are concerned with these compressed computations and conclude with some open problems. As we shall see, still today, there are more open questions than questions that have been satisfactorily answered.
About Csaba
Csaba Szepesvari is a Canada CIFAR AI Chair, the team-lead for the “Foundations” team at DeepMind and a Professor of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. He earned his PhD in 1999 from Jozsef Attila University, in Szeged, Hungary. He has authored three books and over 200 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers. He serves as the action editor of the Journal of Machine Learning Research and Machine Learning, as well as on various program committees. Dr. Szepesvari's interest is artificial intelligence (AI) and, in particular, principled approaches to AI that use machine learning. He is the co-inventor of UCT, a widely successful Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. UCT ignited much work in AI, such as DeepMind's AlphaGo which defeated the top Go professional Lee Sedol in a landmark game. This work on UCT won the 2016 test-of-time award at ECML/PKDD.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Laura Devendorf — Designing Not Knowing
Abstract:
As a design researcher and educator working in human-computer interaction, I often find myself in the business of "empowering" students by teaching them design. As a professor, I write grant proposals that use the magic of design to bring forth preferable futures. Yet, within the present socio-environ-political context, I find myself increasingly conflicted by these claims and asking myself, what, really, can design do? I will not be able to answer any of these questions during this talk because I don't know, but I will argue that the position of not-knowing, humility, and non-expert is useful for critically reflecting on the relevance of our practices. I will present ways that myself, collaborators, and the students with whom I work have been using weaving (sometimes with circuits, some without) as a practice through which to to try to probe, question, and understand what counts as design and the kinds of narratives we must take on in order to be "designers." I aim for this talk to inspire reflection and offer a few tactics for unknowing in order to think otherwise.
Speaker Bio:
Laura Devendorf is an assistant professor in Information Science and the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder. Her research questions the role of design and making in the wake of increasingly pressing global challenges. She directs the Unstable Design Lab where she works closely with students across engineering, information science, and art to speculate on alternative futures for technology. The lab currently focuses on weaving smart textiles and how themes of slowness, presence, and material negotiation can be used as both a practice and metaphor to formulate these visions. She earned bachelors' degrees in studio art and computer science from the University of California Santa Barbara before earning her Ph.D. at UC Berkeley School of Information. Her research has been featured on National Public Radio and has received multiple best paper awards at top conferences in the field of human-computer interaction.

SCS Seminar Talk: Ankush Das
TITLE: Programming Language Principles for Distributed Systems
ABSTRACT:
With the proliferation of distributed systems, the design of safe, secure, and efficient software has become an ever more complex task. The heterogeneous nature of these distributed systems have further introduced domain-specific programming requirements such as programming in an adversarial setting and inferring execution cost. Recognizing these requirements, my research has focused on advancing programming languages to support developers with program verification techniques, complexity analysis tools, and domain-specific languages.
In this talk, I focus on the domain of smart contracts, i.e., programs that enforce digital transactions, often legal or financial, between multiple parties. Programming smart contracts comes with its unique challenges, which include enforcing protocols of interaction, analyzing execution cost, and tracking linear assets. To address these challenges, the talk introduces Nomos, a programming language for smart contracts. To express and enforce protocols, Nomos is based on session types rooted in linear logic. To predict execution cost, Nomos uses resource-aware session types and automatic amortized resource analysis, a type-based technique for inferring cost bounds. To track assets, Nomos employs a linear type system that prevents assets from being duplicated or discarded.
The talk concludes with my future plans on exploring how programming languages can aid in the synthesis of smart contracts, verification of cryptographic protocols, and analysis of probabilistic systems with applications in artificial intelligence.
BIO:
Ankush Das is a final-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University. He is advised by Professor Jan Hoffmann and closely works with Professor Frank Pfenning. He is broadly interested in programming languages with a specific focus on program verification, complexity analysis, and domain-specific languages. He is the lead designer and developer of Nomos, a programming language for smart contracts rooted in resource-aware session types. He has also designed the Rast language based on refinement session types that won the best system description paper award at FSCD 2020. Before joining CMU, he worked as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, India where he designed static analysis and verification tools for Windows driver modules. He completed his undergraduate at IIT Bombay, India in 2014 where he worked on deciding termination of linear loop programs.

SCS Seminar Talk: Aditi Raghunathan
TITLE: Rethinking the Role of Data in Robust Machine Learning
ABSTRACT:
Despite notable successes on several carefully controlled benchmarks, current machine learning (ML) systems are remarkably brittle, raising serious concerns about their deployment in safety-critical applications like self-driving cars and predictive healthcare. In this talk, I discuss fundamental obstacles to building robust ML systems and develop principled approaches that form the foundations of robust ML. In particular, I will focus on the role of data and demonstrate the need to question common assumptions when improving robustness to (i) adversarial examples and (ii) spurious correlations. On the one hand, I will describe how and why naively using more data can surprisingly hurt performance in these settings. On the other hand, I will show that unlabeled data, when harnessed in the right fashion, is extremely beneficial and enables state-of-the-art robustness. In closing, I will discuss how to build on the foundations of robust ML and achieve wide-ranging robustness in various domains including natural language processing and vision.
BIO:
Aditi Raghunathan is a fifth-year Ph.D. student at Stanford University advised by Percy Liang. She is interested in building robust machine learning systems with guarantees for trustworthy real-world deployment. Her research in robustness has been recognized by a Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Machine Learning and the Open Philanthropy AI Fellowship. Among other honors, she is also the recipient of the Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship and the Stanford School of Engineering Fellowship.

Title: New Advances in (Adversarially) Robust and Secure Machine Learning
Abstract: Deep learning models are often vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this talk, we will focus on robustness and security of machine learning against adversarial examples. There are two types of defenses against such attacks: 1) empirical and 2) certified adversarial robustness.
In the first part of the talk, we will see the foundation of our winning system, TRADES, in the NeurIPS’18 Adversarial Vision Challenge in which we won 1st place out of 400 teams and 3,000 submissions. Our study is motivated by an intrinsic trade-off between robustness and accuracy: we provide a differentiable and tight surrogate loss for the trade-off using the theory of classification-calibrated loss. TRADES has record-breaking performance in various standard benchmarks and challenges, including the adversarial benchmark RobustBench, the NLP benchmark GLUE, the Unrestricted Adversarial Examples Challenge hosted by Google, and has motivated many new attacking methods powered by our TRADES benchmark.
In the second part of the talk, to equip empirical robustness with certification, we study certified adversarial robustness by random smoothing. On one hand, we show that random smoothing on the TRADES-trained classifier achieves SOTA certified robustness when the perturbation radius is small. On the other hand, when the perturbation is large, i.e., independent of inverse of input dimension, we show that random smoothing is provably unable to certify L_infty robustness for arbitrary random noise distribution. The intuition behind our theory reveals an intrinsic difficulty of achieving certified robustness by “random noise based methods”, and inspires new directions as potential future work.
Bio: Hongyang Zhang is a Postdoc fellow at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, hosted by Avrim Blum and Greg Shakhnarovich. He obtained his Ph.D. from CMU Machine Learning Department in 2019, advised by Maria-Florina Balcan and David P. Woodruff. His research interests lie in the intersection between theory and practice of machine learning, robustness and AI security. His methods won the championship or ranked top in various competitions such as the NeurIPS’18 Adversarial Vision Challenge (all three tracks), the Unrestricted Adversarial Examples Challenge hosted by Google, and the NeurIPS’20 Challenge on Predicting Generalization of Deep Learning. He also authored a book on machine learning and computer vision in 2017.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Christina Harrington — The Future is Collectivism: Exploring Technology Co-Design From a Lens of Critical Design
Abstract:
The question of who gets to contribute to design futures and technology innovation is an important topic across design and computing fields. This conversation has grave implications for communities that often find themselves an afterthought in technology design, and who coincidentally could benefit most from technological interventions in response to societal oppression. As human-computer interaction continues to frame the intersection of people and technology through a lens of access and humanity, it’s important to consider methods and approaches to computing that are inclusive and equitable, and consider culture and identity as components of interactions. Community-based participatory design allows us to engage those at the margins in design and also considers collectivism as a meaningful approach to speculating community and technology futures. I explore concepts of community collectivism as a way to address challenges of health and racial equity, employing critical theory and frameworks that may better engage marginalized groups. From this talk I hope to build upon the conversation of Who Gets to Future?, and explore recommendations for more equitable technology futures.
Speaker Bio:
As a designer and qualitative researcher, Dr. Christina Harrington focuses on understanding and conceptualizing technology experiences that support health and racial equity among marginalized groups. Her research as the Director of the Equity and Health Innovations Design Research Lab explores ways to employ design as a catalyst for health equity and socially responsible technology experiences. She explores concepts such as health, social acceptance, and collectivism through community-based participatory design and co-creation, engaging critical design and sociotechnical computing. Through participatory research methods she explores constructs of empowerment and access in design among vulnerable communities that have been marginalized along multiple dimensions of identity (age, race, ethnicity, income, class). Dr. Harrington is an Assistant Professor in the College of Computing and Digital Media at DePaul University and received her PhD from Georgia Tech’s College of Design.

SCS Seminar Talk: Maria Apostolaki
TITLE: Building Secure Distributed Systems atop the Insecure Internet
ABSTRACT:
Distributed systems are increasingly important for our everyday life, allowing for high performance, fault tolerance, and flexibility. Many of these systems nowadays rely on the inherently insecure internet infrastructure. Surely though, they should have been designed to take this into account?
In this talk, I will answer negatively to this question using a concrete example: public blockchain systems such as Bitcoin. These are novel distributed systems that are designed according to stringent failure models. In this context, I will explain how an adversary controlling pieces of Internet infrastructure can practically compromise: (i) Bitcoin’s consensus protocol (by partitioning the network); (ii) Bitcoin’s anonymity guarantees (by mapping pseudonyms to real-world identities); and (iii) Bitcoin’s availability (by eclipsing clients).
While these attacks are worrying, I will also introduce practical and effective defenses to counter them both at the network and the application layer. Beyond Bitcoin, this work teaches essential lessons for distributed-system design.

Title: Unraveling the interplay of the Urban form and Mobility Science for Planning Cities
Abstract: The marketing rhetoric around Smart Cities have left some unfulfilled promises when facing sustainability and social well being. Yet, ubiquitous data collection (including mobile devices, GPS, social media, and synoptic video) require new capabilities of computation to disrupt the field of urban planning.
In the first part of my talk, I present one example of how to use big-data to support urban planning decisions in the covid19 era. Via mobile phone data for twenty cities around the world, we study how the distance covered by individuals (rg) varies as the location of their residences moves away from the central business district (CBD). We show that the changes in the statistical distribution of rg between the inner city and the residents of the suburbs classify the centrality of cities better than the population distributions alone. In turn, we propose metrics of urban form and mobility based on rg to predict the infective reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 in eleven Spanish cities. In the second part I show A new urban planning paradigm where, within minutes, inhabitants can access their basic living needs by bike or by foot. In this work, we present novel insights of the interplay between the distributions of facilities and population that maximize accessibility over the existing road networks. Results in six cities reveal that travel costs could be reduced in half through redistributing facilities. In the optimal scenario, the average travel distance can be modeled as a functional form of the number of facilities and the population density
Bio: Marta Gonzalez is an Associate Professor both in City and Regional Planning and Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. She also holds a Physics Research faculty position in the Energy Technology Area (ETA) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). Gonzalez works in the urban science space, with a focus on the intersections between people within social networks and the built and natural environments. Her goal is to design urban solutions through new technologies. To that end, she has developed tools that impact transportation research and discovered novel approaches to model human mobility and the adoption of energy technologies. Her scientific approach is informed by the statistical physics of complex systems and network science. Gonzalez’s research includes the application of big data to understanding human network behavior, with applications in transportation networks, energy efficiency planning and characterization of disease proliferation. Gonzalez was a Scientific Advisory Board member of PTV AG. She was the recipient of a U.N. Foundation award to study consumption patterns of women and girls in the developing world and of a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation award to study access to financial services in the developing world.

SCS & ECE Recruiting Seminar: Akshitha Sriraman
TITLE: Enabling Hyperscale Web Services
ABSTRACT:
Current hardware and software systems were conceived at a time when we had scarce compute and memory resources, limited quantity of data and users, and easy hardware performance scaling due to Moore’s Law. These assumptions are not true today. Today, emerging web services require data centers that scale to hundreds of thousands of servers, i.e., hyperscale, to efficiently process requests from billions of users. In this new era of hyperscale computing, we can no longer afford to build each layer of the systems stack separately. Instead, we must rethink the synergy between the software and hardware worlds from the ground up.
In this talk, I will focus on re-thinking (1) software threading and concurrency paradigms and (2) data center hardware architectures. First, I will describe μTune, my software threading framework that is aware of the overheads induced by the underlying hardware’s constraints. Then, I will discuss SoftSKU and Accelerometer—my proposals to answer the question of: How should we build data center hardware for emerging software paradigms in the post-Moore era? Finally, I will conclude by describing my ongoing and future research towards re-designing the systems stack to enable the hyperscale web services of tomorrow.
BIO:
Akshitha Sriraman is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. Her research bridges computer architecture and software systems, demonstrating the importance of that bridge in realizing efficient hyperscale web services via solutions that span the systems stack. Her systems solutions to improve hardware efficiency have been deployed in real hyperscale data centers and currently serve billions of users, saving millions of dollars and meaningfully reducing the global carbon footprint. Additionally, her hardware design proposals have influenced Intel’s Alder Lake+ CPU architectures.
Sriraman has been recognized with a Facebook Fellowship, a Rackham Merit Ph.D. Fellowship, and was selected for the Rising Stars in EECS Workshop. Her work has been recognized with an IEEE Micro Top Picks distinction and has appeared in top architecture and systems venues like OSDI, ISCA, ASPLOS, MICRO, and HPCA.

You can lead a horse to water...: Representing vs. Using Features in Neural NLP
Abstract
A wave of recent work has sought to understand how pretrained language models work. Such analyses have resulted in two seemingly contradictory sets of results. On one hand, work based on "probing classifiers" generally suggests that SOTA language models contain rich information about linguistic structure (e.g., parts of speech, syntax, semantic roles). On the other hand, work which measures performance on linguistic "challenge sets" shows that models consistently fail to use this information when making predictions. In this talk, I will present a series of results that attempt to bridge this gap. Our recent experiments suggest that the disconnect is not due to catastrophic forgetting nor is it (entirely) explained by insufficient training data. Rather, it is best explained in terms of how "accessible" features are to the model following pretraining, where "accessibility" can be quantified using an information-theoretic interpretation of probing classifiers.
About Ellie
Ellie Pavlick is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Brown University where she leads the Language Understanding and Representation (LUNAR) Lab. She received her PhD from the one-and-only University of Pennsylvania. Her current work focuses on building more cognitively-plausible models of natural language semantics, focusing on grounded language learning and on sample efficiency and generalization of neural language models.

Title: Learning like a Human: Curriculum inspired by Learning Dynamics
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) can surpass humans on certain complicated yet specific tasks, given well-processed data. However, most ML methods treat samples/tasks equally during the course of training, e.g., by taking a random batch per step and repeating many epochs' SGD on all data, which is extraordinarily suboptimal and inefficient from human perspectives, since we would never teach children or students in such a way. On the contrary, human learning is more strategic in selecting or generating the training contents via experienced teachers, collaboration, curiosity/diversity-driven exploration, tracking of memorization, sub-tasking, etc., which have been underexplored in ML. In addition, most of them can be encoded into the selection and schedule of data/tasks during learning, which is another type of intelligence as important as model optimization. A key observation from human learning is that the learning history can indicate the most informative examples/tasks to learn in the future.
In this talk, I will present curricula built upon training dynamics that can substantially improve ML in the wild, e.g., supervised/semi-supervised/self-supervised learning, robust learning with noisy labels, reinforcement learning, ensemble learning, etc., when the data are imperfect and a curriculum can make a big difference. Firstly, we build both empirical and theoretical connections between curriculum learning and the training dynamics of ML models. Our empirical studies show that deep neural networks are fast in memorizing some data but also fast in forgetting some others. Hence, we can accurately allocate those easily forgotten data by earlier-stage training dynamics and make the future training mainly focus on them. Moreover, we find that the consistency of model output overtime for an unlabeled sample indicates its pseudo-label's correctness in self-supervised learning and predicts the future forgetfulness on learned data. These discoveries are in line with human learning and combining them leads to more efficient and smarter curricula for a rich class of ML problems. Theoretically, we study how to find a curriculum that can optimize the training dynamics over a data distribution in continuous time. Interestingly, the theoretically derived curriculum matches our empirical strategies and has an insightful interpretation with the tangent/path kernel from deep learning theories. Secondly, I will give you some examples of human curriculum strategies that are effective on ML. I will show you how to translate them to discrete-continuous optimizations that can be solved efficiently. Lastly, I will discuss future directions and potential applications for healthcare, transportation, banking, scientific discovery, social good, etc.

SCS Seminar Talk: Matteo Brucato
TITLE: Package Queries: Scalable Prescriptive Analytics Close to the Data
ABSTRACT:
Decision making is central to a broad range of domains, including finance, transportation, healthcare, the travel industry, robotics, and engineering. It is often found at the very final step of business analytics--prescriptive analytics--to allow businesses to transform a rich understanding of data, typically provided by advanced predictive models, into actionable decisions. Modeling and solving these problems have relied on application-specific solutions, which are often complex, error-prone, and not generalizable. My goal is to create a domain-independent, declarative approach, supported and powered by the system where the data relevant to these problems typically resides: the database. Despite the widespread importance of prescriptive analytics, unified solutions close to the data did not exist.In my talk, I will present a prototype system that supports package queries, a new query modelthat extends traditional database queries to handle complex constraints and preferences over answer sets. Package queries allow the declarative specification and efficient evaluation of a significant class of constrained optimization problems--integer programs--within a database. These queries pose unique challenges to a database system, ranging from their richer expressive power, more complex semantics, and harder computational complexity than their SQL counterpart, to scalability issues that arise from large amounts of data and uncertainty in the data. I will illustrate how our unified system addresses all these challenges achieving high performance and quality in many real-world problems from finance, healthcare, and science. I will also present my vision for data-centric systems for decision making, and their connections with robotics, machine learning, natural language processing, visualization, operations management, and simulation.

SCS Seminar Talk: Dylan Foster
TITLE: Bridging Learning and Decision Making
ABSTRACT:
Machine learning is becoming widely used in decision making, in domains ranging from personalized medicine and mobile health to online education and recommendation systems. While (supervised) machine learning traditionally excels at prediction problems, decision making requires answering questions that are counterfactual in nature, and ignoring this mismatch leads to unreliable decisions. As a consequence, our understanding of the algorithmic foundations for data-driven decision making is limited, and efficient algorithms are typically developed on an ad hoc basis. Can we bridge this gap and make decision making as easy as machine learning? Focusing on the contextual bandit, a core problem in data-driven decision making, we bridge the gap by providing the first optimal and efficient reduction to supervised machine learning. The algorithm allows users to seamlessly apply off-the-shelf supervised learning models and methods to make decisions on the fly, and has been implemented in widely-used, industry-standard tools for decision making. Our results advance a broader program to develop a universal algorithm design paradigm for data-driven decision making. I will close the talk by discussing challenges and opportunities in building such a framework, including efforts to extend our developments to difficult reinforcement learning problems in large state spaces.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Marshini Chetty — Imagine All The People On A Trustworthy Internet
Abstract:
Imagine a world where the Internet caters to all types of users and hosts trustworthy content. Right now, this world seems far off for many reasons. For instance, this world would require us to think more broadly of user needs beyond an `average’ tech-savvy adult user—one who is assumed to be always online with a reliable Internet connection. Moreover, this world would require us to host content that is not misleading or manipulative in some way—content that can be evaluated at face value by various users. To achieve this lofty goal, we first need to deeply understand and catalogue different types of Internet users’ needs and also develop ways to assess and make misleading online content more apparent to end-users.
In this talk, I will present a set of case studies from my research lab that helps further the goal of a trustworthy Internet for all. I will describe various projects geared at understanding a wide variety of Internet users’ needs for online privacy and security in different contexts from children to those in developing contexts. I will also describe work that provides empirical evidence of misleading content online such as `dark patterns’ and disguised advertisements and create solutions to help users to better evaluate this content. These case studies will demonstrate how important it is to study the privacy and security needs of those who do not fit the “average” user mold and demonstrate possible solutions for helping users gain more trust in information on the Internet. I conclude with open questions for imagining an Internet which is more trustworthy and inclusive to all people.

SCS Seminar Talk: Sahil Singla
TITLE: Algorithms and Uncertainty
ABSTRACT:
Modern algorithms have to regularly deal with uncertain inputs. This uncertainty can take many forms, e.g., in online advertisement future users are unknown (the input arrives online), in spectrum-auctions bidder valuations are unknown (the users are strategic), and in oil-drilling the amount of oil is unknown (the input is stochastic). Traditionally, there has not been significant overlap in the study of these different forms of uncertainty. I believe that studying these uncertainties together gives us a lot more power. In this talk, I will give an overview of my research in “Algorithms and Uncertainty” where I am able to successfully use these relationships.
Studying these different forms of uncertainty together allows us to find connections and build unifying techniques. As an example, I will talk about my progress on long-standing combinatorial auctions problems that deal with strategic inputs, by using techniques which were originally developed for online inputs. Moreover, a combined study of uncertainty helps us find richer cross-cutting models. For example, several important online problems do not admit good algorithms in the classical worst-case models. I will talk about how to give a “beyond the worst-case” analysis for such problems and obtain more nuanced performance guarantees, by using models/techniques arising in other forms of uncertainty.

SCS Seminar Talk: Marios Kogias
TITLE: Building Latency-Critical Datacenter Systems
ABSTRACT:
Online services play a major role in our everyday life for communication, entertainment, socializing, e-commerce, etc. These services run inside the datacenter under strict tail-latency service level objectives in order to remain interactive. The emergence of new hardware for IO has enabled microsecond-scale datacenter communications that challenge the efficiency of existing operating system and network mechanisms. Also, new in-network programmable devices start being deployed in datacenters and introduce a new computing paradigm that shifts functionality traditionally performed at the end-points to the network.
In this talk I will revisit the operating systems, networking, and distributed systems infrastructure specifically targeting latency-critical datacenter systems, while drawing intuition from basic queueing theory results. In the first part of the talk, I will focus on ZygOS[SOSP 2017], a system optimized for μs-scale, in-memory computing on multicore servers. ZygOS implements a work-conserving scheduler within a specialized operating system designed for high request rates and a large number of network connections. ZygOS revealed the challenges associated with serving remote procedure calls (RPCs) on top of a byte-stream oriented protocol, such as TCP. In the second part of the talk, I will present R2P2[ATC 2019]. R2P2 is a transport protocol specifically designed for datacenter RPCs, that exposes the RPC abstraction to the endpoints and the network, making RPCs first-class datacenter citizens. R2P2 enables pushing functionality, such as scheduling, fault-tolerance, and tail-tolerance, inside the transport protocol. I will show how using R2P2 allowed us to offload RPC scheduling to programmable switches that can schedule requests directly on individual CPU cores.
BIO:
Marios Kogias is a researcher at MSR Cambridge. He graduated from EPFL in August 2020. His main research focus is at the intersection of operating systems and networking in the datacenter. He’s working on building and understanding systems with strict tail-latency SLOs leveraging new emerging hardware. He was an IBM PhD Fellow and won the best student paper award at Eurosys2020. Before joining EPFL he got his undergrad degree from the National Technical University of Athens. He has interned at Cern, Google, and Microsoft Research

Generative models based on point processes for financial time series simulation
Abstract:
In this seminar, I will talk about generative models based on point processes for financial time series simulation. Specifically, we focus on a recently developed state-dependent Hawkes (sdHawkes) process to model the limit order book dynamics [Morariu-Patrichi, 2018]. The sdHawkes model consists of an oracle Hawkes process and a state process following Markov transition. The Hawkes and state processes are fully coupled, which enables the point process captures the self-and cross-excitation as well as the interaction between events and states. We will go through the model formulation in sdHawkes, the simulation of sdHawkes, its maximum likelihood estimation, and more importantly, its application to high-frequency data modeling that captures the interactions between the order flow and the state of the current market.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Silvia Lindtner — Prototype Nation: China and the Contested Promise of Innovation
Abstract:
How did China’s mass manufacturing and “copycat” production become transformed, in the global tech imagination, from something holding the nation back to one of its key assets? Prototype Nation offers a transnational analysis of how the promise of democratized innovation and entrepreneurial life has shaped China’s governance and global image. Lindtner reveals how a growing distrust in Western models of progress and development, including Silicon Valley and the tech industry after the financial crisis of 2007–8, shaped the rise of the global maker movement and the vision of China as a “new frontier” of innovation. Lindtner’s investigations draw on more than a decade of research in makerspaces, tech incubators, corporate offices, and factories. She examines how the ideals of the maker movement, to intervene in social and economic structures, served the technopolitical project of prototyping a “new” optimistic, assertive, and global China. In doing so, Lindtner demonstrates that entrepreneurial living influences governance, education, policy, investment, and urban redesign in ways that normalize the persistence of sexism, racism, colonialism, and labor exploitation. Prototype Nation shows that by attending to the bodies and sites that nurture entrepreneurial life, technology can be extricated from the seemingly endless cycle of promise and violence. **Get Prototype Nation now for 30% off with code P234 from the Princeton U Press website.**
Speaker Bio:
Silvia Lindtner (she/her) is an Associate Professor at the University of Michigan in the School of Information and Associate Director of the Center for Ethics, Society, and Computing (ESC). She is a founding member of Precarity Lab, a research collective working on various forms of insecurity, vulnerability, and social and cultural exclusion that digital platforms produce and mediate. She is the co-founder of the China research collective Hacked Matter, dedicated to critically investigating processes of technology innovation, urban design, and production cultures in China. Lindtner's research interests include cultures and politics of technology innovation and entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on the gendered and racialized forms of labor necessary to incubate entrepreneurial life and sustain technological promise. Lindtner draws from more than ten years of multi-sited ethnographic research, with a particular focus on China's shifting position in the global political economy of technology production, economic development, and science and technology policy. She is the author of Prototype Nation: China and the Contested Promise of Innovation (Princeton University Press, 2020). The book reveals how a growing distrust in Western models of progress and development, including Silicon Valley and the tech industry after the financial crisis of 2007–8, shaped the vision of China as a “new frontier” of innovation. Lindtner unpacks how this promise of entrepreneurial life has influenced governance, education, policy, investment, and urban redesign in ways that normalize the persistence of sexism and racist forms of violence and colonial logics of othering. Lindtner’s work contributes to the fields of STS (science and technology studies), cultural and feminist anthropology, China studies, HCI (human computer interaction), global communication studies, science and technology policy, and design. Her research has been awarded support from the US National Science Foundation, IMLS, Intel Labs, Google Anita Borg, and the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation.

SCS Seminar Talk: Zhao Song
TITLE: The Theory of Provable and Efficient Deep Learning
ABSTRACT:
Deep learning has fundamentally revolutionized our society, including recommendation systems that suggest movies and items to purchase, virtual assistants, and future autonomous vehicles. From a theoretical point of view, there are two main questions in deep learning: (1) understanding of why deep learning works, (2) how to speed the running time of deep learning algorithms. In this talk, I will provide progress for these two questions. First, I will show that stochastic gradient descent is able to memorize all the input data points under some mild assumptions. Second, I will present a new optimization algorithm for fast deep learning. The key observation is that stochastic gradient descent is an iterative algorithm, and gradients change slowly in each iteration. This observation allows us to update gradients in a lazy fashion, significantly improving per-iteration running time. Finally, I will briefly describe how to apply similar ideas to speed up convex optimization and quantum machine learning.

We are starting a collaboration between Digital Media and Public Policy that explores how gig workers’ labor is enmeshed with automation tools in Poshmark.com. Poshmark is an online reselling platform for secondhand fashion that offers a social retail model, like social media for secondhand clothes. This grant from IPAT and the GVU Center will allow us to carry out interviews with various workers that belong to the Poshmark ecosystem as sellers, as virtual assistants that fill the roles automation would otherwise do, or as the programmers that offer the automation tools. According to the company, most sellers and buyers are women in the U.S and Canada. As many other platforms of the gig economy, Poshmark has many sellers looking for supplemental income while others derive their earnings fully from their sales on the platform. The use of automation by the sellers is a complex issue because it is against Poshmark’s Terms of Service (ToS), yet the site design requires high amounts of tedious clicking and routine interaction to maintain product visibility. The interviews will allow us to better understand how the different resellers on Poshmark justify the use of automation and work along the boundaries of the ToS. We hope this will contribute to shedding light into the complex ways contemporary laborers are navigating a work landscape that increasingly includes automation.
Electrochromic Skin: Exploring the Design and Fabrication of Epidermal Displays for Somatic Data-Awareness. Sang Leigh (Industrial Design), W. Hong Yeo (Mechanical Engineering), Noah Posner (College of Design)
We explore an accessible and scalable fabrication method for soft printed displays—using a novel electrochromic material, PEDOT:PSS. The process could revolutionize existing forms of printed and wearable products; these include on-skin interfaces or textiles that can display digital information, and packagings, wallpapers or stickers that dynamically change their visual with minimal power consumption. We plan to deploy the technique in the form of a soft display microlab within the Interactive Product Design Lab (IPDL) at the College of Design, where students and researchers can create and customize printed displays using commercial inkjet printers and simple craft tools. We will explore various applications through design workshops involving students and researchers on campus, on the topics of epidermal health-tracking devices, smart packaging concepts for retail or food products, and apparels made with electrochromic textiles.
Healing Justice: Co-Designing for Black Communities. Susana Morris (LMC), Brooke Bosley (LMC)
During the summer of 2020, Black Americans faced a series of inequities from police brutality, to systemic racism, to COVID-19, all of which impacted Black communities at higher rates than other racial groups because of disparities in health and resources. Policies regarding defunding the police have been offered as solutions that could address racial inequity and injustice. Proponents of defunding legislation argue that reallocating funding from policing can allow funds to be reinvested in Black communities through entrepreneurship programs, mental health services, after school programs, and other resources that would offer community support. However, the language of defunding has faced much opposition, primarily because of misinformation and lack of clear explanation of what these policies truly mean for Black communities. As Black Media Studies Scholars, we seek to understand how this misinformation is trafficked on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Parler, and MeWe. The research project’s goals are threefold: to understand how proposed legislation on defunding the police tackles racial equity and justice, to analyze whether these defunding policies strengthen communities that are overpoliced (mainly Black neighborhoods), and to investigate how ideology online has impacted communities' perceptions around public safety.
COVID-19 and Child Maltreatment Through Two Different Lenses: Online Media and Official Administrative Reports. Diyi Yang (Interactive Computing), Lindsey Bullinger (Public Policy)
COVID-19 has profoundly changed all aspects of home and family life during most of 2020. Severe and sudden unemployment, school closures, and quarantining have created enormous challenges, particularly in the homes of children. Additional hardships may include public benefits office closures, limited hours for accessing essential services. These problems are also likely exacerbated among low-income families. Particularly in the lives of parents, social media plays a large role everyday life. For example, pre-pandemic, many parents used social networks and social media to exchange information, resources, and social support online. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the social distancing and lockdown orders have led to people spending even more time online. Given the current constraints with more traditional measures of child abuse and neglect (namely, fewer interactions with mandated reporters such as teachers), social media data can be leveraged to gain insight into how child well-being has fared during the pandemic. This research will combine social media data and administrative data on child maltreatment referrals to answer several research questions: (1) How has child exposure to violence changed during the COVID-19 pandemic according to social media data? (2) How do these online media data compare to administrative data on child maltreatment referrals? (3) How do these influences differ before and during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Developing a New Cellular-Based Sensor Platform for IoT/Smart Cities Projects. Russ Clark (Computer Science), Peter Presti (IMTC), Scott Gilliland (IMTC)
The networked LoRa-based processor board at the heart of the Sea Level Sensors Program has become a cornerstone of our IoT environmental sensing efforts. The field deployment and the data gathered is at the heart of a growing set of collaborations and projects across campus and in the community. Over the course of the project we have discovered a need for a low-powered cellular network-based sensor platform. The goal of this work is to develop this new cellular platform that will fill a gap in our current toolkit for new projects and collaborations across campus and community partners. The platform is designed to be easily modified, benefiting student projects and funded research alike. The resulting device will be customizable with a set of standardized off-the-shelf sensors to meet specific implementation requirements. Additionally, the targeted applications fit squarely in the UN sustainable development goals, especially that of Sustainable Cities and Communities, Good Health and Wellbeing, and Climate Action.
Going Pro: Bridging the Gap Between Georgia K-12 Students, STEM Education, and the E-Sports Industry. Laura Levy (IMTC), Sean Mulvanity (Bradwell Institute), Richard Catrambone (Psychology), Bryan Cox (GA Department of Education), Lien Diaz (Constellations Center)
Esports, or competitive video gaming, can be an effective way to motivate grade-school students in developing STEM skills and pursuing STEM fields. The most popular esports titles are team-based, placing high requirements on skills requiring communication, coordination, and compromise. Students excited by being a part of an esports team and community are likely to develop other skills, such as software and hardware engineering as well as web design and video editing, to supplement their play performance and contribute to their team in ways outside of playing the game. However, there remain barriers to entry for schools and students in implementing esports programs. While public sentiment on esports is changing for the positive, there can still be doubt and misunderstandings around the benefits for esports programs in school administrations, educators, parents, and students alike. Even for schools convinced by the beneficial impacts of esports programs, there can be confusion in how to navigate the evolving landscape of leagues, games, and equipment to purchase. Finally, and particularly for schools in rural Georgia, there is a lack of connection for schools and students with the state of the industry, which often manifests in misconceptions on what it means to pursue a STEM career in the games industry. This proposal focuses on rural and underserved communities in Georgia, to further the mission of service by Georgia Tech for educational outreach in the state. This project proposes a two part engagement with all virtual activities, to maintain safe best practices during COVID-19 while also maximizing our outreach to students that can benefit the most from this engagement but are located geographically far from Georgia Tech. Virtual interviews and focus groups with educators, students, and parents will inform the design and content of a virtual workshop with esports industry partners meant to help orient, educate, and provide resources for stakeholders across the state in the benefits and process of incorporating esports programs in K-12 schools.
Alone Together: Empowering Student Community Building and Content Engagement Through Digital Collaboration in Remote Learning. Laura Levy (IMTC), Anne Sullivan (LMC)
The landscape of education delivery has dramatically changed due to COVID-19 with students and instructors doing their best to adapt to virtual learning formats. The speed and extent of changes to remote instruction during COVID-19 have presented a number of challenges and, as a result, many students express feelings of disconnectedness and have difficulties engaging with material in a remote format. Additionally, virtual formats primarily rely on a narrow range of evaluative assessments that can prevent students from expressing full mastery of course material and magnify impacts of accessibility issues already existing in traditional classroom settings (e.g. access issues for students with cognitive or perceptual disabilities). Video conferencing can be intimidating for unconfident students or for those where English is not their primary language, and many students may not have stable enough internet connections to be able to use video, voice, or even know if what they are seeing is in real time. Therefore, we propose to identify and analyze existing digital tools and their best practices that can be adopted to improve students’ sense of community, increase course material engagement, and provide alternative ways to demonstrate mastery. This proposed work seeks to produce timely knowledge on platforms and practices that better support student course engagement and feelings of connectedness during remote education. While the impetus for this work is COVID-19, the outcomes of this work can be useful beyond the pandemic and we hypothesize that they will be generalizable to other forms of remote education and remote collaboration in the workforce.

Multiclass and Multi-Label Learning with General Losses: What is the Right Output Coding and Decoding?
Abstract
Many practical applications of machine learning involve multiclass learning problems with a large number of classes -- indeed, multi-label learning problems can be viewed as a special case. Multiclass learning with the standard 0-1 loss is fairly well understood; however, in practice, applications with large numbers of classes often require performance to be measured via a different, problem-specific loss. What is the right way to design principled and efficient learning algorithms for multiclass (and multi-label) problems with general losses?
From a theoretical standpoint, an elegant approach for designing statistically consistent learning algorithms is via the design of convex calibrated surrogate losses. From a practical standpoint, an approach that is often favored is that of output coding, which reduces multiclass learning to a set of simpler binary classification problems. In this talk, I will discuss recent progress in bringing together these seemingly disparate approaches under a unifying lens to develop statistically consistent and computationally efficient learning algorithms for a wide range of problems, in some cases recovering existing state-of-the-art algorithms, and in other cases providing new ones. Our algorithms require learning at most r real-valued scoring functions, where r is the rank of the target loss matrix, and come with corresponding principled decoding schemes. I will also discuss connections with the field of property elicitation, and new tools for deriving quantitative regret transfer bounds via strongly proper losses.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Gabriela Marcu — Designing for Coordination and Intervention in Behavioral Health
Abstract:
Behavioral and mental health is an underserved area, and receives less focus in health informatics research. Technology can play a role in different types of coordination with meaningful impact on behavioral and mental health. However, it is critical for design in this space to engage with issues of agency, marginalization, and trauma. In this talk, I will share two projects in which I have grappled with these issues. The first explores challenges of coordination across clinical, school, and home contexts in support of children’s behavioral development. Collaborative technologies are needed to help stakeholders cross these organizational and disciplinary boundaries, so they can reduce tensions and work together. The second project I will share involves the coordination of strangers. UnityPhilly is a community-based intervention that uses a smartphone app to coordinate life-saving layperson response to an opioid overdose. Just prior to the pandemic, we completed a one-year pilot study with 112 participants who helped to revive 74 victims of overdose. Across these two projects, I will reflect on how we can design mobile and collaborative technologies to fill gaps in care coordination and provide supplemental interventions for behavioral and mental health.
Speaker Bio:
Gabriela Marcu is an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information. She studies the delivery of behavioral health services and the use of digital health interventions. Her expertise is in designing and evaluating use of systems for health through qualitative methods, participatory design, community-based approaches, and field studies. She involves undergraduate researchers in all of her projects, and has been the recipient of a NCWIT Undergraduate Research Mentoring Award as well as an Early Career Mentor Award from the Council on Undergraduate Research’s Math and Computer Science Division. She holds a Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University, and a B.S. in Informatics from the University of California, Irvine.

CSE Webinar by Cornell University Ph.D. Nabil Imam
Abstract:
It’s exciting times at the intersection of machine learning and computational neuroscience. Deep neural networks grew out of ‘connectionist’ models in neuroscience and psychology in the 1980s and have found tremendous success in machine learning despite being based on models that are over three decades old. Since that time, an enormous amount has been learned about the circuit-level organization of the brain, yet it remains unclear how to use that knowledge to advance the capabilities of machine learning and AI.
A particularly important research topic is to understand how the generation and manipulation of discrete pulses of neural activity, known as ‘spikes’, underlie neural computations. In this talk, I will describe a model of a neural circuit in biological olfaction that leverages spike-timing-dependent mechanisms of coding and computation to rapidly learn and identify signals from a chemosensor array. I will show how information encoded within the relative timing patterns of spikes is exploited by synaptic learning rules in the model, and how processes of neuromodulation and contextual priming enhance its computational capabilities. I will also discuss the model’s performance compared to alternative techniques and describe its implementation in field-deployable neuromorphic chips.
Bio: Nabil Imam received his Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University in 2014, with minors in neuroscience and applied mathematics. During his time in graduate school he worked on DARPA’s SyNAPSE program and built computing systems modeled after the architecture and dynamics of biological neural networks. He subsequently worked at IBM Research and Intel Labs, in the design teams of IBM’s TrueNorth and Intel’s Loihi neuromorphic systems. His research interests are in formal descriptions of neural computations and their applications to neuromorphic computing.

Abstract
As society and technology becomes increasingly interconnected, so does the threat landscape. Once isolated threats now pose serious concerns to highly interdependent systems, highlighting the fundamental need for robust machine learning. This dissertation contributes novel tools, algorithms, databases and models—through the lens of robust machine learning—in a research effort to solve large-scale societal problems affecting millions of people in the areas of cybersecurity and healthcare.
1. Tools: We develop TIGER, the first comprehensive graph robustness toolbox; and our Robustness Survey identifies critical yet missing areas of graph robustness research.
2. Algorithms: Our survey and toolbox reveal existing work has overlooked lateral attacks on computer authentication networks. We develop D2M, the first algorithmic framework to quantify and mitigate network vulnerability to lateral attacks by modeling lateral attack movement from a graph theoretic perspective.
3. Databases: To prevent lateral attacks altogether, we develop MalNet-Graph, the world’s largest cybersecurity graph database—containing over 1.2M graphs across 696 classes—and show the first large-scale results demonstrating the effectiveness of malware detection through a graph medium. We plan to extend MalNet-Graph by constructing the largest binary-image cybersecurity database—containing 1.2M images, 133x more images than the only other public database—enabling new discoveries in malware detection and classification research restricted to a few industry labs (MalNet-Image).
4. Models: To protect systems from adversarial attacks, we develop UnMask, the first model that flag semantic incoherence in computer vision systems, which detects up to 96.75% of attacks, and defends the model by correctly classifying up to 93% of attacks. Inspired by UnMask's ability to protect computer visions systems from adversarial attack, we develop REST, which creates noise robust models through a novel combination of adversarial training, spectral regularization and sparsity regularization. In the presence of noise, our method improves state-of-the-art sleep stage scoring by 71%--allowing us to diagnose sleep disorders earlier on and in the home environment—while using 19x less parameters and 15x less MFLOPS.

Talk Title: From Diagnosis to Treatment - Augmenting Clinical Decision Making with Artificial Intelligence
BlueJeans Link: https://bluejeans.com/886367122
Abstract: Though the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare warrants genuine enthusiasm, meaningful impact will require careful integration into clinical care. AI tools are susceptible to mistakes and rarely capable of capturing all of the nuances pertaining to a complex clinical situation. Thus, we propose approaches designed to augment, rather than replace, clinicians during clinical decision making. In this talk, I will highlight two related research directions in which we propose i) a transfer learning approach for mitigating potentially harmful shortcuts when making diagnoses and ii) a novel reinforcement learning approach for matching patients to treatments. In summary, there’s a critical need for machine learning in healthcare; however, the safe and meaningful adoption of these techniques will require collaboration between clinicians and AI.

The Debate that Changed Programming: A Living History of Computing’s Famous Collaboration
A quarter century into the modern era of computing, two young assistant professors joined forces with the legendary Alan Perlis, one of the founding fathers of American computer science, and would publish a paper challenging the conventional wisdom that computer programming should be formal and mathematical. It was a shot across the bow to Edsgar Dijkstra, Tony Hoare and many others who sought the certainty of mathematical proofs of software correctness. The paper would become a lightning rod for a debate that would continue for the better part of four decades. It moved federal funding patterns and was the backdrop for dramatic showdowns between formalists and pragmatists.
Twenty years later, those same assistant professors ended up in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech to continue their lifelong collaboration. One of them, W. Storey Professor of Computing Richard “Dick” Lipton was the first Georgia Tech computer scientist elected to the National Academy of Engineering. The other was Richard “Rich” DeMillo, who left his position as Chief Technology Officer at Hewlett-Packard to become the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing.
Their seminal 1979 work, “Social Processes and Proofs of Theorems and Programs,” is now part of a new collection of 46 classic papers in computer science published as a book this year from the MIT Press. Ideas That Created the Future by Harvard Professor Harry Lewis spans the intellectual birth and growth of the field – from Leibnitz and Boole to Knuth and RSA – and covers the sweeping discoveries and advancements that have come to define computer science. As Lewis points out in his introductory essay, “The fact that some computer scientists still bristle when this paper is mentioned is testament to its dialectic force.”
The College of Computing at Georgia Tech invites you to take part in a historical conversation between Rich DeMillo and Dick Lipton, two pioneers in computer science who helped shape a field that has come to reshape how we live every day.
Join the virtual fireside chat, Thursday, June 17, 2021, at 7 PM ET, for this living history – as told by the men who lived it – and hear about the experiences and their roles in this turning point in computer science.

ML Virtual Seminar: Learning Locomotion: From Simulation to Real World
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) holds the promise of designing complex robotic controllers automatically. In this talk, I will discuss two different approaches to apply deep reinforcement learning to learn locomotion controllers for legged robots. The first approach is through sim-to-real transfer. Due to safety concerns and limited data, most of the training is conducted in simulation. However, controllers learned in simulation usually perform poorly on real robots. I will present a set of techniques to overcome this sim-to-real gap. The second approach is to directly learn in the real world. Due to the complexity and diversity of the real environments, building a simulation that can faithfully model the real world is not always feasible. Having the ability to learn on the fly and adapt quickly in real-world scenarios is crucial for large-scale deployment of robots. I will discuss the challenges of training legged robots in the real world and various ways to address these challenges.
Bio: Tan's research is to develop safe machine learning techniques and apply them to real-world systems, such as robots and power grids. His research enables robots to automatically learn skills to accomplish complex tasks in the real world.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Fostering Public Understanding of AI Through Education & Design
Abstract:
As artificial intelligence is integrated into our schools, homes, and workplaces, it becomes increasingly important to foster public understanding of AI. My research has explored two important facets of this issue—developing AI education initiatives and expanding existing AI systems to improve their ability to interact naturally with humans and foster understanding through interaction. Several design themes guide my work, including using embodied interaction, collaboration, and creative exploration to reduce intimidation and foster curiosity and learning. I will discuss my research investigating how to define AI literacy, and I will present several activities I have designed for informal learning spaces that can foster family learning about AI. I will also discuss how my research on developing co-creative AI systems can inform the development of more understandable AI systems. My talk will conclude with reflections on how education and system design can be leveraged to create more equitable, understandable AI in our everyday lives.

Machine Learning Virtual Seminar: Towards a Theory of Representation Learning for Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: Provably sample-efficient reinforcement learning from rich observational inputs remains a key open challenge in research. While impressive recent advances have allowed the use of linear modelling while carrying out sample-efficient exploration and learning, the handling of more general non-linear models remains limited. In this talk, we study reinforcement learning using linear models, where the features underlying the linear model are learned, rather than apriori specified. While the broader question of representation learning for useful embeddings of complex data has seen tremendous progress, doing so in reinforcement learning presents additional challenges: good representations cannot be discovered without adequate exploration, but effective exploration is challenging in the absence of good representations. Concretely, we study this question in the context of low-rank MDPs [Jiang et al., 2017, Jin et al., 2019, Yang and Wang, 2019], where the features underlying a state-action pair are not assumed to be known, unlike most prior works. We develop two styles of methods, model-based and model-free. For the model-based method, we learn an approximate factorization of the transition model, plan within the model to obtain a fresh exploratory policy and then update our factorization with additional data. In the model-free technique, we learn features so that quantities such as value functions at subsequent states can be predicted linearly in those features. In both approaches, we address the intricate coupling between exploration and representation learning, and provide sample complexity guarantees. More details can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10814 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07035.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Exploring the Promise and Peril of Emotion AI
Abstract:
Emotion AI, which predicts psychological characteristics from data, offers potentially transformative benefits for societal well-being, productivity, and security. Drawing on increasingly available biodata--data about people’s bodies and behaviors, such as video, audio, or heart rate--emotion AI predicts emotions, stress, focus, and other characteristics. Emotion AI increasingly informs sensitive decisions in many varied contexts, from social media to online education, online job interviews, or security surveillance systems and criminal investigations.
A key challenge to emotion AI is that algorithmic ways of modeling emotion differ fundamentally from human ways of understanding emotion, making emotion AI predictions difficult to meaningfully interpret and apply in real-world contexts. In addition, even people aware of widespread video surveillance may be unaware that an additional layer of algorithmic surveillance using emotion AI is making sensitive predictions about their inner psychology from video of their facial expressions, leading to privacy and civil liberties risks.
My design research explores both the promise and peril of emotion AI, and contributes design tactics to more effectively support social, embodied, and emotional meaning-making with data. Combining building custom biosensing technologies and realtime data displays with concepts from the arts and humanities, my work explores, how might we imagine a more affirmative biopolitics with data?

Machine Learning Virtual Seminar: Structured Prediction - Beyond Support Vector Machine and Cross Entropy
Abstract: Many classification tasks in machine learning lie beyond the classical binary and multi-class classification settings. In those tasks, the output elements are structured objects made of interdependent parts, such as sequences in natural language processing, images in computer vision, permutations in ranking or matching problems, etc. The structured prediction setting has two key properties that makes it radically different from multi-class classification, namely, the exponential growth of the size of the output space with the number of its parts, and the cost-sensitive nature of the learning task, as prediction mistakes are not equally costly. In this talk, I will present recent work on the design on loss functions that combine numerical efficiency and statistical consistency (joint work with Alessandro Rudi, Alex Nowak-Vila, Vivien Cabannes).

GVU Center Brown Bag: How Health Informatics Will Transform Healthcare
Abstract:
Computers have been used in healthcare from their earliest days. Much visionary work was done in the 1950's and 60's but it inevitably failed to achieve acceptance for technical and non-technical reasons we will discuss. As a result, healthcare is correctly widely viewed as the last major industry to embrace the information age. That is changing. We will explore the new technology landscape and look at some of the early transformative applications it has enabled around the world.
Speaker Bio:
After over 25 years as a company founder in the health IT field, Dr. Braunstein became a Professor of the Practice in the School of Interactive Computing in 2007. For years, he taught Georgia Tech's introductory health informatics course and lectured and wrote extensively about the field. He became an early advocate of FHIR, the API that is patterned after the web and is fueling a transformation in how informatics is deployed in healthcare. He just completed the second edition of his textbook, Health Informatics on FHIR, and this talk will highlight the most interesting innovations that he discovered writing it.

GVU Center Brown Bag: AI-CARING How Use Inspired Research with Older Adults Informs the Future of AI
Abstract:
We anticipate that AI will play a pivotal role in supporting the goals of older adults to “age in place” and sustain quality of life and independence. However, designing these technologies requires supporting the actions of older adults alongside their caregivers, spouses, adult children, and healthcare providers while being able to draw on a longitudinal understanding of routines, habits, norms, and values. In this talk, I draw from several projects to reflect on the challenges incumbent in designing for informal care networks. These challenges include establishing trust, respecting privacy, retaining autonomy, and combatting disparities. While these challenges are significant, the benefits of designing for care networks are substantial and this multi-stakeholder approach has the greatest potential for long-lasting care. This work now grounds the “use inspired” research for the new NSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups (AI-CARING).

SCS Colloquium: Alfred Spector
TITLE: Opportunities & Perils of Data Science
ABSTRACT:
Data science has provided unprecedented opportunities to learn new insights and to predict, recommend, cluster, classify, transform, and optimize. Catalyzed by large-scale, networked computer systems, vast availability of data, and machine learning algorithms, data science has been extraordinarily impactful to-date, and it holds great promise in all disciplines. However, no new technology arrives without complications, and we have recently seen both the press and various political circles illustrating real, potential, and fictional implications of the field.
This presentation aims to balance the opportunities provided by data science against the many challenges that have ensued. At its core, the talk proposes a rubric that practitioners can apply to tease out data science’s complexities and also maps out seven categories of data sciences challenges, ranging from engineering to ethics. The talk is illustrated with examples from many applications, and it concludes with some suggested ways to address the downsides of the field.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Krystina Madej — Representation of Disability in Children’s Video Games
Abstract:
While video game accessibility for people with disability has been given serious thought and been addressed by video game developers since the early 2000s, representation of disability in video games has been less well addressed. How children’s perception of disability is established and maintained or altered through playing video games in which characters with disabilities are represented has received no attention at all. The most instrumental type of representation of disability in games should provide children with exposure to and engagement with new video game schemas that add understanding and help create meaning about the disability represented.
Video games differ significantly in how they represent disability. Representation can be cosmetic, providing exposure but not gameplay utility; it can be incidental, used as a device that provides purpose for the narrative; or it can accurately represent the disability and show how the character copes with their disability. How representation is perceived by children, i.e. the message that is received, depends on what stage a child may be in in their cognitive development, the society of which they are a part, and their exposure to disability in games previously.
This talk shares a current EU research project in which nineteen games (1994-2020) with a PEGI 3 rating, and seventeen games (2004 to 2020) with a PEGI 7 rating, were reviewed and characters analyzed to consider how representation of disability maps against cognitive development and psychomotor and cognitive needs and abilities of children ages 3 to 12.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Q. Vera Liao — Human-Centered Explainable AI (XAI): From Algorithms to User Experiences
Abstract:
Artificial Intelligence technologies are increasingly used to make decisions and perform autonomous tasks in critical domains. The need to understand AI in order to improve, contest, develop appropriate trust and better interact with AI systems has spurred great academic and public interest in Explainable AI (XAI). The technical field of XAI has produced a vast collection of algorithms in recent years. However, explainability is an inherently human-centric property and the field is starting to embrace human-centered approaches. Human-computer interaction (HCI) research and user experience (UX) design in this area are increasingly important especially as practitioners begin to leverage XAI algorithms to build XAI applications. In this talk, I will draw on our research and broad HCI work to highlight the central role that human-centered approaches should play in shaping XAI technologies, including to drive technical choices by understanding user needs, to uncover pitfalls of existing XAI methods, and to provide conceptual frameworks for human-compatible XAI.
Speaker Bio:
Q. Vera Liao is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Montreal. Her current interest is in human-AI interaction and explainable AI, with a focus on bridging state-of-the-art AI technologies and user-centered design practices. She serves as the Co-Editor-in-Chief for Springer HCI Series, on the Editorial Board of IJHCS and ACM TiiS, and has been on the Organizing Committee for IUI 2019 and CSCW 2021. Before joining MSR, she worked at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Noopur Raval — Studying Intersectional Challenges in Gig Work — co-hosted by CHIWORK.org
Abstract:
With the rise and proliferation of gig economy platforms providing ride hailing, food delivery and other app-based services on-demand in major urban centers of the world, there have been major transformations in work and life globally. Gig platforms have certainly disrupted and redefined the discovery and allocation of casual work through algorithmic management, creating grave concerns for regulating the future of work. Simultaneously, especially in the global South, gig platforms have also emerged as important avenues for gaining temporary paid work and socio-economic mobility for low income individuals, women and migrant workers. Drawing on over five years of ethnographic research with a variety of stakeholders in the gig economy including workers, managers, consumers and regulators, my work shows how platformization produces heterogeneous effects on the lives, livelihoods and productive and reproductive capacities of different individuals in urban India. This talk will draw on multiple case studies of gig work to show these heterogeneous effects and how everyday technology practice also informs platform design in return. I will also offer some considerations for HCI scholars looking to study the effects of emerging technologies in global South settings.
Speaker Bio:
Noopur Raval is a postdoctoral researcher at the AI Now Institute and an adjunct professor at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University. She received her PhD in Informatics from UC Irvine in 2020 and is a tech ethnographer and interdisciplinary scholar at the intersection of HCI, Communication and Media Studies, Cultural Anthropology and Postcolonial History. She has written extensively on gig work, platformization and the future of work in the global South. Her new work extends to studying the cultural labor and subjective decision-making by global South data annotators in order to train AI/ML systems. Her work has appeared in CSCW, CHI, ACM Interactions among other venues. She has also worked in UX research at multiple Microsoft Research labs. Noopur is an alumna of the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University and the Center for Tech, Society and Policy at UC Berkeley.

Ensuring Robust Security on Mobile Devices
Abstract:
Mobile devices have become ubiquitous gear throughout the world. They are quintessential extensions of our daily lives with numerous sensors and radios while also hosting more and more of our daily living (e.g., calendars, financial information, access to healthcare information, present location, etc.). As such, it is important that while mobile devices provide robust connectivity and contextual awareness of our surroundings, they do this in a way that provides for the security and privacy of the user. While each generation (i.e., “G”) of cellular technology takes a heightened approach to these aspects, the earlier G’s do not benefit from the upgrades. In this tech talk, we will discuss two key features that Qualcomm has developed to improve the privacy and security of users’ activities on mobile devices, independent of the network. Hypervisor capability allows for a scalable virtualization framework within the smartphone to enable multiple personas and secure use cases; while attestation improves the confidence the operator of the smartphone is the actual owner of the smartphone. While the breadth and depth of commercial adoption of smartphones drive the need for these capabilities, QGOV is leveraging these features to improve the security and privacy of government users as well.
Henry's Bio
Henry Tong has over 25 years of experience in the Tech Industry. He currently is the head of engineering at Qualcomm’s Government Technologies (QGOV) division where he leads projects involving secure communications, trusted computing, and software-defined radios. He has also worked on the commercial side of Qualcomm where he led efforts involving integration, test, software automation, and handset OEM support. Prior to joining Qualcomm, Henry worked as a hardware designer at AT&T Bell Labs and a software lead for the F-22 project at Raytheon. Henry has a BS EE from Cornell University and an MS CE/CS degree from UCLA.
Viji's Bio

GVU Center Brown Bag: Clio Andris — Human Network Regions as Spatial Units for COVID-19 Policy Implementation
Abstract:
In the U.S., COVID-19 messaging and policy implementation (i.e., school closures and stay-at-home orders) are largely administered at the state level. This can be problematic, as functional metropolitan areas can straddle multiple states, and a single state may have subregions that are not well-connected. Much of our messaging for emergencies (such as hurricane warnings) is not at the state-level but at the county-level for these reasons. Such state-level policies have already resulted in friction in local communities—especially in Georgia. To define units for which it is reasonable to apply homogeneous rules, we construct regions that capture core geographies of social and movement behavior.
To create effective geographic regions for policy implementation, we apply community-detection algorithms to five large networks of mobility and social-media connections to construct geographic regions that reflect natural human movement and relationships at the county level for the continental United States. We measure COVID-19 cases, case rates, and case rate variation across adjacent counties and examine these dynamics along the boundaries of functional regions and state boundaries.
We find that regions constructed using GPS-trace ("trip") networks and commuter networks are the most effective natural partitions for capturing COVID-19 'hot spots.' Conversely, regions constructed from geolocated Facebook friend connections resulted in the least effective partitions. Regions derived from migration flows, Twitter connections, and state boundaries showed mixed results. This analysis reveals that functional regions derived from mobility data are more appropriate geographic units than states for making policy decisions about opening areas for activity, assessing vulnerability of populations, and allocating resources.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Christina Chung — Personal Informatics in the Changing, Social World
Abstract:
Personal informatics refers to information individuals can collect about themselves, such as food intake, physical activity, sleep, and mood. Current personal informatics tools have been designed primarily for personal use, focusing on quantitative measurements that are easy to collect via sensors or manual input. These systems often overlook the changing nature of everyday life, the social contexts individuals live in, the variety of goals and values they have, and the constraints and preferences associated with these contexts and values. My research has examined the collaborative use of personal informatics data and co-constructed experience in various contexts. In this talk, I will share a few recent studies unpacking ways to rethink personal informatics technology that considers the changing contexts of health behavior, shifting values and priorities, as well as the social roles and relationships that often deeply intertwine with health decisions.
Speaker Bio:
Christina Chung is an Assistant Professor in Informatics and the Luddy Faculty Fellow 2020/2021 at the Indiana University Bloomington. She is also the director of the Proactive Health lab.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Lauren Margulieux — Building Theory in STEM Education Research: Spatial Encoding Strategies Theory and Multiple Conceptions Theory
Abstract:
Education research frequently calls for theory-building work to better explain the mechanisms of how people learn. This talk discusses two theories developed based on a synthesis of work across multiple education-related fields to explain phenomena frequently seen in STEM education. The first theory, Spatial Encoding Strategy theory, proposes a mechanism to explain how spatial skill training improves generalized problem solving while other forms of brain training produce only localized results. It draws upon work in discipline-based education, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and learning sciences. The second theory, Multiple Conceptions theory, proposes a mechanism to explain how both direct instruction and constructivist instructional approaches can be designed to guarantee successful results. It draws upon instructional approaches from various STEM fields and educational psychology.
Speaker Bio:

GVU Center Brown Bag: Carl DiSalvo — Design as Democratic Inquiry
Abstract:
In this talk, I’ll share my new book, Design as Democratic Inquiry. This book discusses a series of projects grounded in collaborations with communities and institutions. In these collaborations, I explore the potentials and limitations of design to participate in democracy through what I call design experiments in civics. In particular, I explore how, as engaged designers, we might contribute to the work of communities and institutions who explore alternative civic imaginaries, which keep our democracies vibrant. This requires rethinking the stories we tell about design, how we practice design, and how we theorize design. Rather than repeating the heroic tales of innovation, I argue for embracing design as fragile, contingent, partial, and compromised: designing becomes a way to care for our collective futures together.
Speaker Bio:
Carl DiSalvo is an Associate Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology. His work explores the political qualities of contemporary design, and he is particularly interested in participatory and critical approaches to making and using technology. He is the author of Design as Democratic Inquiry and Adversarial Design, co-editor of Participatory Design for Learning, and an editor of the journal Design Issues.

The Cyber Dimension of the Crisis in Ukraine: An Expert Panel Discussion
The Cybersecurity Lecture Series presents: A look at the Ukraine crisis from a cybersecurity perspective.
This panel brings together experts on the cyber dimension of the conflict in Ukraine to explore its geopolitical context and potential trajectories. The Russian military intervention in Ukraine has taken an ominous turn recently with the buildup of Russian military forces on the Ukrainian border. This represents an escalation in a long-running conflict that began in the wake of the Euromaidan demonstrations in Kyiv in late 2013, resulting in the Russian occupation of the Crimea and military stalemate in the Donbass region. Ukraine also became one of the most active cyber battlefields in the world. Russia has conducted continuous espionage, disinformation, and subversion campaigns. Its operations have caused electrical blackouts in 2014 and 2015 and triggered the NotPetya infection in 2017. Indeed, Ukraine has become the paradigmatic example of cyber conflict in the “gray zone” between peace and war.
What are we to make of the current buildup? While no one can predict the future of a dangerous and dynamic crisis like this, our panelists can provide some political and strategic context. We focus in particular on the role of cyber warfare and information operations in the current phase of this crisis. Will the future resemble the past? Should we expect cyber operations to be used as complement to or substitute for military operations? Will cyber attacks make military escalation more or less likely? How might information and disinformation operations shape the Ukrainian or NATO responses to Russian acts? And how should the United States respond?Panelists:

GVU Center Brown Bag: Jason Wiese — Not Just Another User Study: Uncovering Systematic Shortcomings Of Familiar Research Methods
Abstract:
Whom does computing serve, whom does it underserve, and do we even know whom we’re missing? Human-computer interaction has matured as a research community with a goal of understanding the effects of technology on people; through that maturity, the research methods we use in the field have mostly stabilized around a familiar and reliable set of qualitative and quantitative methods that help us to take a broad human-centered perspective. But these methods also have limits for what they can tell us about how people might engage with technology, and if we as a field fail to inspect those limits we run the risk of systematically ignoring the needs of end users.
In this talk I explore methodological limitations we have encountered in my research group’s recent projects, including work with individuals who have had a spinal cord injury and a project examining air quality data with parents of asthmatic children. In both cases, there were relatively obvious considerations we needed to make to accommodate research with these participants. However, there was something more subtle lurking underneath: in both cases there were also deeper methodological challenges that would have led to an incomplete picture of those user populations. I argue that researchers and practitioners in human-computer interaction, and more broadly across computing, have a responsibility to interrogate ourselves; to ask in earnest “How do our methods fall short, and whom do we harm in those shortcomings?”
Speaker Bio:
Jason Wiese is an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at the University of Utah where he leads the Personal Data and Empowerment Lab (PeDEL).

School of Cybersecurity & Privacy Recruiting Seminar
The School of Cybersecurity & Privacy is welcoming Benedikt Bünz for a seminar titled, Improving the Privacy, Scalability, and Ecological Impact of Blockchains. Bünz is a Ph.D. student at Stanford University in the applied cryptography lab with Dan Boneh. His work focuses on the science of blockchains.
The faculty recruiting seminar is scheduled for Feb. 8 at 12 p.m. in the 9th floor atrium of the Coda Building.
Abstract: Blockchains are an exciting area of research that touches on many areas of Computer Science and beyond. This technology has the potential to enable a fast, cheap, and private financial system based on distributed consensus and cryptography, instead of trusted parties. Despite this potential, the reality still shows severe limitations of blockchains: (i) transactions can cost hundreds of dollars and take minutes to confirm, (ii) some blockchains offer little privacy, and (iii) proof-of-work consensus consumes too much energy. In this talk, I will discuss powerful techniques that follow a prover paradigm and can mitigate these limitations. The first technique, called Bulletproofs, is a general-purpose zero-knowledge proof system that is specifically designed to enable confidential blockchain transactions. Bulletproofs requires minimal trust assumptions and gives the shortest zero-knowledge proofs without a trusted setup. The system is widely deployed and powers tens of thousands of private blockchain transactions per day. The second technique, called inner pairing products, is a way to aggregate many zero-knowledge proofs into a single short proof. This can significantly reduce on-chain data, leading to a significant increase in transactions per second that the chain can process. The third technique is a new concept called a verifiable delay function (VDF) that is vital for permission-less and eco-friendly consensus. VDFs are already deployed in Filecoin and Chia, and are planned for Ethereum 2.0, the upcoming upgrade to Ethereum.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Golnaz Arastoopour Irgens — Co-Designing a Critical Machine Learning Educational Program With and For Children
Abstract:
The world is becoming increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that collect, store, and analyze our data. Such technologies improve our quality of life, but they also (re)inforce inequities and harm marginalized populations. As digital technologies become more ubiquitous, it will become critical for all young people to have a deep understanding of AI that empowers them to enact change in their local communities and globally. In this talk, I discuss how researchers and children collaborated to develop a critical machine learning after-school education program, in which children explored the social and ethical consequences of large-scale algorithm deployment and applied machine learning content knowledge. Findings show that children were able to 1) explain how biased training datasets could be harmful and 2) build robots for social good that used their own designed classification algorithms. Reflecting on these findings, I argue for the benefits of participatory design methods in designing critical machine learning educational environments, as well as the unresolved tensions that emerge.
Speaker Bio:
Dr. Arastoopour Irgens is Assistant Professor of Learning Sciences at Clemson University, Director of the IDEA lab, and Vice President of the International Society for Quantitative Ethnography. She is a former middle school computer science and high school mathematics teacher. Her research focuses on (1) designing inclusive digital learning environments focusing on engineering and computer science and (2) using quantitative ethnography to make sense of how learners engage with digital technologies. In her design-based research, she engages in participatory methods that actively involve teachers, students, and community partners working together to co-design digital learning environments that serve their communities.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Jim McCann — What Do Knitting Machines Make?
Abstract:
Industrial knitting machines are used to fabricate many complex objects, including gloves, sweaters, layered cloth, and shaped fiber reinforcement for composites. But, fundamentally, what is it that knitting machines are actually making?
Well, in a topological sense, knitting machines don't make anything at all. Any knit object, fresh off the machine, can be unraveled (continuously deformed) back into straight segments of yarn.
But that's not a very satisfying answer, so in this talk I will eschew such topological nihilism using two different approaches. Viewing knitting through a high-level lens (thinking of stitches as lying on surfaces) one can show that knitting machines can create arbitrary arrangements of 2D tubes and sheets, limited only by a resolution/depth complexity trade-off. Taking a lower-level view, one can freeze certain parts of a knit structure in order to safely deploy the tools of topology and braid theory to explore and transform knitting programs without changing their meaning.
This will be a richly-illustrated, reasonably self-contained romp through the world of knitting design tools and representations, based on both completed and ongoing work in the Carnegie Mellon Textiles Lab (https://textiles-lab.github.io/), with no knitting or computer graphics background required.
Speaker Bio:
James (Jim) McCann is an Assistant Professor in the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute. He is interested in systems and interfaces that operate in real-time and build user intuition; lately, he has been applying these ideas to textiles fabrication and machine knitting as the leader of the Carnegie Mellon Textiles Lab. He received his PhD from Carnegie Mellon in 2010, and worked at Adobe research, as an independent game developer, and at Disney research, before joining Carnegie Mellon as Faculty. He lives about 500ft from the Forbes Ave / Fern Hollow Creek bridge, which collapsed two days before he wrote this bio.

School of CSE Webinar
Please join the School of CSE on Feb. 17 at 11 a.m. for a webinar presentation by King’s College London Professor Steve Niederer His talk is titled Computational Cardiology: Integrating Physics, Physiology and Clinical Data
To join the meeting:
BlueJeans Link: https://bluejeans.com/559999271/8550 Passcode 8550
Abstract: Precision medicine is emerging as the future of cardiology. Clinical decisions for cardiology patients increasingly rely on advanced imaging technology, genetic profiling, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. However, current guidelines are still informed by population averages, decisions are made on the current state of the patient, and clinical data are often not interpreted in the context of known physiology and physics. Computational cardiology aims to provide a common quantitative framework, informed by physics and physiology, to integrate and interpret clinical data to inform patient decisions. Representing patient data in predictive frameworks allows patients to be treated on their expected outcome from therapy, not just their current state. In addition, creating patient-specific models allows therapies to be tailored to the individual. Further, as increasing numbers of patient-specific models are created, this provides a framework for rapidly testing pre-clinical hypotheses in patients, evaluating novel biomarkers, synthesizing training data for machine learning algorithms, and testing innovative devices through in-silico trials. Our work focuses on an integrated clinic-to-model and back again workflow. In this presentation, I will describe our work on pre-clinical, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure applications, focusing on the technical challenges in creating and deploying applied cardiac models at scale.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Nithya Sambasivan—The Myopia of Model Centrism
Abstract:
AI models seek to intervene in increasingly higher stakes domains, such as cancer detection and microloan allocation. What is the view of the world that guides AI development in high risk areas, and how does this view regard the complexity of the real world? In this talk, I will present results from my multi-year inquiry into how fundamentals of AI systems—data, expertise, and fairness—are viewed in AI development. I pay particular attention to developer practices in AI systems intended for low-resource communities, especially in the Global South, where people are enrolled as labourers or untapped DAUs. Despite the inordinate role played by these fundamentals on model outcomes, data work is under-valued; domain experts are reduced to data-entry operators; and fairness and accountability assumptions do not scale past the West. Instead, model development is glamourised, and model performance is viewed as the indicator of success. The overt emphasis on models, at the cost of ignoring these fundamentals, leads to brittle and reductive interventions that ultimately displace functional and complex real-world systems in low-resource contexts. I put forth practical implications for AI research and practice to shift away from model centrism to enabling human ecosystems; in effect, building safer and more robust systems for all.
Speaker Bio:
Dr. Nithya Sambasivan is a sociotechnical researcher whose work is in solving hard, socially-important design problems impacting marginalised communities in the Global South. Her current research re-imagines AI fundamentals to work for low-resource communities. Dr. Sambasivan's work has been widely covered in venues like VentureBeat, ZDnet, Scroll.in, O’Reilly, New Scientist, State of AI report, HackerNews and more, while influencing public policy like the Indian government’s strategy for responsible AI and motivating the NeurIPS Datasets track. As a former Staff Research Scientist at Google Research, she pioneered several original, award-winning research initiatives such as responsible AI in the Global South, human-data interaction, gender equity online, and next billion users, which fundamentally shaped the company’s strategy for emerging markets, besides landing as new products affecting millions of users including in Google Station, Search, YouTube, Android, Maps & more. Dr. Sambasivan founded and managed a blueprint HCI team in Google Research Bangalore, and set up the Accra HCI team, in contexts with limited existing HCI pipelines. Simultaneously, her research has received several best paper awards at top-tier computing conferences.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Dhanaraj Thakur — Finding the Sweet Spot: Working At The Intersection Between Research and Technology Policy
Abstract:
How can we design research that informs technology policy debates?
How can research help advance human rights advocacy in those debates?
And at the same time how can that research be novel and offer a contribution to the field?
These are some of the factors that guide research in advocacy organizations. In this talk I will discuss some of the ways we address these challenges drawing on practical experiences as well as my research. I will refer to our research in three broad areas - content moderation, surveillance, and disinformation. Specifically, I will share our experiences addressing problems such as detecting harmful content in end-to-end encrypted messaging services, understanding the extent to which school issued devices monitor students and in what ways, and an ongoing project examining the potentially disproportionate impacts of disinformation on women of color political candidates in the U.S. These diverse examples will also demonstrate how we bring together interdisciplinary teams of researchers to tackle these problems and how we create spaces for researchers and policy-makers to learn from each other.
Speaker Bio:
Dhanaraj Thakur is Research Director at the Center for Democracy & Technology, where he leads research that advances human rights and civil liberties online. Over the last 15 years, he has designed and led several research projects aimed at tech policy audiences and ranging in scope from multi-national studies to community level work. He has been interviewed and his work quoted in several news media, including WIRED, CNN, the WSJ, the Economist, the Guardian (UK), and the Financial Times, among others. In addition, he has published over 35 peer reviewed journal articles, book chapters, and conference papers; as well as reports for several civil society organizations, multilateral development banks, and governments. He holds a PhD in Public Policy from the Georgia Institute of Technology (USA), and is a graduate of the London School of Economics, the University of the West Indies, and the University of Technology in Jamaica.

Nivedita Arora, Designing for Sustainability in Computing: Self-Powered Computational Material
In this era of burgeoning IoT devices, we measure computing progress with speed, power, and reliability improvements but often forego thinking about its environmental impact. A new sustainable way of thinking about computing across the full lifecycle -- including manufacturing, operation, and disposal -- is necessary to meet the present needs without compromising the wellbeing of the future generations. Inspired by this, during my Ph.D. I have built ‘Self-powered Computational Material’ that enables sustainable operation without toxic batteries. I will showcase this with an example of an easy-to retrofit sticky note that can sense human interactions like speech, movement, and touch and provide feedback by harvesting power from the surroundings. Finally, I will chart how designing for sustainability requires a high-interdisciplinary mindset and rethinking the entire computing stack from the material level.
Upol Ehsan, Human-Centered Explainable AI: Thinking Outside the Black-Box of AI
As AI systems power critical decisions in our lives, they need to be held accountable to mitigate an unjust AI-powered future. One way to hold AI systems accountable is to make them explainable– to understand the “why?” behind their decisions. Implicit in Explainable AI (XAI), is the question: explainable to whom? The “who” governs the most effective way of describing the “why” behind the decisions. Critical insights into how best to explain AI’s black box lie outside it; because that’s where the humans are.
In this talk about AI, humans will take center stage. I will discuss three aspects of the journey towards Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI), a departure from the algorithm-centered roots of XAI. First, I will share how people’s perceptions of AI agents explaining their actions in plain English shaped the foundations of how we think about who the humans are in Human-centered Explainable AI (HCXAI). Second, I will chart the visions of HCXAI by bridging insights from Critical Theory and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to question the status quo of XAI design and expose intellectual blind spots. Third, I will apply the HCXAI lenses to highlight an intellectual blind spot in the algorithm-centered narrative of XAI and share how we addressed it by introducing the concept of Social Transparency in AI– a sociotechnically situated concept that expands the boundaries of XAI by incorporating socio-organizational contexts into AI systems. I will share key lessons from this journey towards HCXAI including missed turns and design implications around improving explainability, calibrating trust, and fostering decision-making.
Qiaosi Wang, Mutual Theory of Mind for Human-AI Communication
From navigation systems to smart assistants, we communicate with various types of AI on a daily basis. At the core of such human-AI communication, we convey our understanding of the AI system’s capability to the AI through utterances with different complexities, and the AI conveys its understanding of our needs and goals to us through system outputs. However, this communication process is prone to failures for two reasons: the AI systems might have the wrong understanding of the user and the user might have the wrong understanding of the AI. In my work, I posit the Mutual Theory of Mind framework, inspired by our basic human capability of “Theory of Mind”, to enhance mutual understanding in human-AI communication. My work takes place in the context of online education where AI agents have been widely deployed to offer informational and social support to online students. In this talk, I will discuss the three components of Mutual Theory of Mind in human-AI communication: the construction, recognition, and explanation of AI’s Theory of Mind. I will then describe in detail about one of my studies that leveraged linguistic cues in human-AI dialogues to construct a community’s understanding of an AI agent.

Counter-Institutional Data Accomplices
Project Title: Court Eviction Data as a Boundary Object for Housing Work with Carl DiSalvo [Interactive Computing], Elora Raymond [City and Regional Planning], and Anh-Ton Tran [Interactive Computing]
Housing costs in Atlanta have increased nearly 28% since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, institutional investors and Private Equity firms are snatching up more property and operating as landlords across communities of color, particularly in Atlanta. This reinscribes historical cycles of racial dispossession and inequity. How might computing scholars, with our disciplinary expertise in data, complement the fight for housing as a human right? Particularly when we live in an age where data is used as a scaffold to the commodification of housing? In this work, we present our findings and reflections working with a local housing activist-non-profit: Housing Justice League. We first describe and analyze the data practices volunteering and technically managing a remote, community outreach tool for tenants facing eviction and seeking organizing support. We then interpret the work of Housing Justice League through the lens of care, identifying home-brewed databases and data fragmentations as negotiations between care and efficiency. We argue that care is enacted through the assemblage of the technical systems, and present tinkering as an alternative approach to developing data practices. Understanding how housing activists use data is a prerequisite to consider aiding and abetting social movement work with data. We conclude by sharing our most recent endeavors to utilize and couple institutional eviction data with grassroots data to inform organizing initiatives. We present a preliminary case on why corporate landlords exacerbate housing instability and how data can support future tenant organizing work.
Creating E-Textiles Across Disciplines
Project Title: E-Textile Workshop Series with Lisa Marks [Industrial Design] and Noah Posner [Industrial Design]
GVU is preparing to open an exciting new lab focused on the area of E-textiles. This lab focuses on a rapidly emerging field that will lead to technological innovation for wearables, home goods, healthcare, and transportation. To maximize this field’s potential, we must have students trained in both the hardware and coding as well as the fabric structure and making methods. This Engagement Grant has funded the development of a series of 3 workshops (weaving, knitting, and CNC embroidery), each involving a discussion of the textile qualities and history, a hands-on demonstration and student creation of the textile, coding and implementation of electronic sensors, and a brainstorming session of potential uses of the methods covered in a variety of fields.
Internet Connection, Disconnection, and Everything In-Between
Project Title: Edge Computing for Bringing Smart Services to Underserved Urban Communities with Kishore Ramachandran [Computer Science], Ashutosh Dhekne [Computer Science], Manasvini Sethuraman [Computer Science], and Anirudh Sarma [Computer Science]
Today we are substantially dependent on centralized infrastructure (aka Cloud based services such as Netflix, Uber, YouTube, Coursera, Google Maps, etc.) for most of our everyday activities including learning, hailing a ride, restaurant suggestions in a neighborhood, etc. Many of our day-to-day activities depend on smart services made available to our fingertips from the cloud —be it participating in school, homework submission, job hunting, or grocery shopping. Studies have shown that access to the Internet (connection speed, duration of connectivity, and cost of connectivity) influences the way people search for jobs or do homework which in turn affects quality of life. While Internet penetration continues to be on the rise in densely populated urban areas, there continues to be a section of society where reliable and good Internet access is still not the norm. In urban areas, lack of access to the Internet is often correlated with lower income. We engaged with local leaders, public schools and non-profits to understand the internet infrastructure in Atlanta’s Westside, especially from the education standpoint. We present some of our findings, along with proposals for low-cost self-sustainable technological solutions to improve internet penetration in the neighborhood, without necessarily relying on increasing the number of internet subscriptions.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Using the Virtual Proving Ground (VPG) to Expedite and Validate the Creation of Autonomous Solutions
Abstract:
Background: Trimble is committed to delivering autonomy solutions that bring value to our customers faster than ever before. But creating autonomy solutions is not an easy task. These new technologies need to control real equipment out in the real world safely and efficiently. One of the most difficult challenges is getting access to the real machines to test the latest build, validate algorithms or verify that multiple components integrate correctly. Another challenge is access to ground truth. When data is collected in the field, one has to also obtain the best possible data that represents the “truth”. Any errors in your ground truth data will affect the accuracy of the estimated efficiency of the solution.
One of the technologies that has been identified as an enabler for creating complex solutions is simulation. For the past eight years, Trimble has promoted the Virtual Proving Ground as a way to optimize and share the benefits of high-fidelity simulations.
Problem Statement: Even though there is a general consensus that simulation can solve these problems, it can also raise other challenges. One of the most critical ones is that there is little time between the moment when stakeholders decide that a simulation system needs to be used in a project and the moment when developers and testers need to have access to the actual simulator.
Synopsis: In this presentation, we will share the way the virtual proving ground (VPG) is being used to expedite the development of several autonomy projects in Trimble. The presentation will show examples of several custom simulators created with a just- in- time approach to deliver virtual equipment with hardware in the loop to testers, developers and stakeholders. Finally, we will present an overview of the latest and future upgrades of the VPG tools that have enabled the Trimble autonomy simulation team to deliver and continue to produce high fidelity solutions in record time.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Ethics Work: Engaging Technology Values and Ethics through Design
Abstract:
Growing public discussions, legislative actions, and worker actions call for greater consideration of social values and ethics during technology development. In response, approaches such as compliance checklists have been developed to address these issues. However, fully addressing ethical issues in technology systems requires approaches beyond prescriptive checklists, also needing a broader range of modes of action across different stages of technology development and use.
In this talk, I report on projects that investigate different modes of engaging ethical concerns in design. One project uses speculative design probes to prompt conversations with technology professionals about privacy and surveillance in Internet of Things technologies in various social contexts. Another focuses on the work practices of a group of North American user experience (UX) professionals at large technology companies. These professionals see addressing social values and ethical issues as part of their everyday UX work. They also aim to create change at group or institutional levels from their positionalities within large corporations, with mixed success.
Throughout the talk, I draw out several relationships between design and ethics that can help engage in surfacing, discussing, and addressing values and ethical issues, including: design as a form of ethical provocation; design as a form of labor to address ethical issues; and design as a research method and reflective practice. This research points to a broader set of modes of engagement that can be used to consider values and ethical issues during technology design research and practice.
Speaker Bio:
Richmond Wong is an Assistant Professor in Digital Media at the School of Literature, Media, and Communication. His research focuses on understanding the social values, ethical issues, and work involved in technology production and use. He studies how technology professionals address ethical issues in their work. He also develops design-centered approaches to engage groups that create or are impacted by digital technology, to proactively discuss and consider ethical issues related to technology such as privacy or fairness. Richmond's work utilizes qualitative and design-based methods, drawing from science and technology studies, speculative and critical design, and human-computer interaction. He completed his Ph.D. at the University of California Berkeley School of Information.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Batteries Not Included: Reimagining Computing for the Next Trillion Devices
Abstract:
For decades our smart devices, from wireless sensor networks to FitBits, have generally assumed stable, reliable power from a battery or wall outlet. These devices are exploding in numbers and quickly becoming the foundational data collection platforms used to inform societal and personal scale decisions. Unfortunately, the battery dependency of these devices prevents scaling (because of bulk, expense, and maintenance) and contributes to existing global e-waste problems. This talk explores an alternative; instead of relying on energy stored in a battery, harvesting energy from the surrounding environment; however, this unstable energy supply means that these devices compute intermittently through many power failures. This new paradigm of sustainable computational things has required a rethinking of hardware, software design, and tool creation– yet it has also opened up incredible new avenues to deploy sustainable data science infrastructure, health sensing, and reimagine education at scale. I'll describe advances in making these devices more useful in the context of motivating data-science applications our lab has worked on: including late-breaking work on smart face masks, a system that enables novices to program intermittently powered devices with Python or Block-based languages, and large scale environmental monitoring.
Speaker Bio:
Josiah Hester holds the Allchin Chair and is Associate Professor of Interactive Computing and Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Josiah was previously at Northwestern as an Assistant Professor. He works in intermittent computing and battery-free embedded computing systems. He applies his work to health wearables, interactive devices, and large-scale sensing for sustainability and conservation, supported by multiple grants from the NSF, NIH, and DARPA. He was named a Sloan Fellow in Computer Science and won his NSF CAREER in 2022. He was named one of Popular Science's Brilliant Ten, won the American Indian Science and Engineering Society Most Promising Scientist/Engineer Award, and the 3M Non-tenured Faculty Award in 2021. His work has received six Best Paper type Awards and seven Best Presentation type Awards, and featured in the Wall Street Journal, Scientific American, BBC, Popular Science, Communications of the ACM, and the Guinness Book of World Records, among many others.

Title: All your Credentials are Belong to Us: On Insecure WPA2-Enterprise Configurations
Abstract: In this paper, we perform the first multifaceted measurement study to investigate the widespread insecure practices employed by tertiary education institutes (TEIs) around the globe when offering WPA2-Enterprise Wi-Fi services. The security of such services critically hinges on two aspects: (1) the connection configuration on the client-side; and (2) the TLS setup on the authentication servers. Weaknesses in either can leave users susceptible to credential theft. Typically, TEIs prescribe to their users either manual instructions or pre-configured profiles (e.g., eduroam CAT). For studying the security of configurations, we present a framework in which each configuration is mapped to an abstract security label drawn from a strict partially ordered set. We first used this framework to evaluate the configurations supported by the user interfaces (UIs) of mainstream operating systems (OSs), and discovered many design weaknesses. We then considered 7045 TEIs in 54 countries/regions, and collected 7275 configuration instructions from 2061 TEIs. Our analysis showed that majority of these instructions lead to insecure configurations, and nearly 86% of those TEIs can suffer from credential thefts on at least one OS. We also analyzed a large corpus of pre-configured eduroam CAT profiles and discovered several misconfiguration issues that can negatively impact security. Finally, we evaluated the TLS parameters used by authentication servers of thousands of TEIs and discovered perilous practices, such as the use of expired certificates, deprecated versions of TLS, weak signature algorithms, and suspected cases of private key reuse among TEIs. Our long list of findings have been responsibly disclosed to the relevant stakeholders, many of which have already been positively acknowledged.

A Decade of Machine Learning Accelerators: Lessons Learned and Carbon Footprint
David Patterson, professor-emeritus at UC Berkeley and a Google distinguished professor, will give a lecture, A Decade of Machine Learning Accelerators: Lessons Learned and Carbon Footprints, on October 12. The talk will take place at 11 am with a question-and-answer session at 11:40, and it will be in rooms 1116-1118 of the Marcus Nanotechnology Building.
The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) from Machine Learning (ML) has inspired domain specific architectures (DSAs) for them. Google’s first generation DSA offered 50x improvement over conventional architectures for ML inference in 2015. Google next built the first production DSA supercomputer for the much harder problem of training. Subsequent generations greatly improved performance of both phases. We start with ten lessons learned from such efforts.
The rapid growth of DNNs rightfully raised concerns about their carbon footprint. The second part of the talk identifies the “4Ms” (Model, Machine, Mechanization, Map) that, if optimized, can reduce ML training energy by up to 100x and carbon emissions up to 1000x. By improving the 4Ms, ML held steady at <15% of Google’s total energy use despite it consuming ~75% of its floating point operations. With continuing focus on the 4Ms, we can realize the amazing potential of ML to positively impact many fields in a sustainable way.
David Patterson is a UC Berkeley Pardee professor emeritus, a Google distinguished engineer, and the RISC-V International Vice-Chair. His most influential Berkeley projects likely were RISC and RAID. His best-known book is Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach. He and his co-author John Hennessy shared the 2017 ACM A.M Turing Award and the 2022 NAE Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering. The Turing Award is often referred to as the “Nobel Prize of Computing” and the Draper Prize is considered a “Nobel Prize of Engineering.”

Title: Vulnerability Discovery for All: A Human-Centric Approach to Software Vulnerability Discovery
Abstract: Software vulnerabilities persist as an important and costly challenge. Significant effort has been exerted toward automatic vulnerability discovery, but human intelligence generally remains required, and will remain necessary for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, the pool of experts qualified to perform vulnerability discovery is small and homogeneous, leading to negative outcomes such as labor shortages and a lack of perspective diversity. In this talk, I will present the results of multiple studies investigating the humans at the center of vulnerability discovery. I will discuss the technical (e.g., the processes they follow to find vulnerabilities), along with the social (e.g., how they interact with others and navigate the bug bounty landscape) aspects of their work. From these results, I will lay out recommendations for developing more usable tooling, effective education, and more welcoming communities to make vulnerability discovery more approachable and inclusive.
Bio: Dr. Daniel Votipka is the Lin Family Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Tufts University. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Maryland. His work focuses on understanding the processes and mental models of professionals who perform security-related tasks such as secure development, vulnerability discovery, network defense, and malware analysis to make security work more accessible and inclusive through improvements in automation, education, and policy. His work has been recognized with multiple best paper awards at top security and HCI venues and he was a recipient of the John Karat Usable Privacy and Security Student Research Award. Previously, he served in the US Air Force as a Cyber Warfare Officer assigned to the National Security Agency.

Title: Spook.js: Attacking Chrome Strict Site Isolation via Speculative Execution
Abstract: The discovery of the Spectre attack in 2018 has sent shockwaves through the computer industry, affecting processor vendors, OS providers, programming language developers, and more. Because web browsers execute untrusted code while potentially accessing sensitive information, they were considered prime targets for attacks and underwent significant changes to protect users from speculative execution attacks.
We present Spook.js, a JavaScript-based Spectre attack that can read from the entire address space of the attacking webpage. We further investigate the implementation of strict site isolation in Chrome, and demonstrate limitations that allow Spook.js to read sensitive information from other webpages. We further show that Spectre adversely affects the security model of extensions in Chrome, demonstrating leaks of usernames and passwords from the LastPass password manager. Finally, we show that the problem also affects other Chromium-based browsers, such as Microsoft Edge and Brave.
Biography: Jason Kim is a second-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. Daniel Genkin at Georgia Tech's School of Cybersecurity and Privacy. Jason's research lies at the intersection of side-channel attacks arising from CPU microarchitecture and how they can be exploited from web browsers. His ultimate goal is to harden web browsers against leaking secrets: billions of people browse the internet on a daily basis and handle sensitive or personal information on the web, yet browsers automatically execute untrusted code served from websites as soon as a user visits the site. Prior to Georgia Tech, Jason graduated from the University of Michigan in 2021 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. He is an author and presenter of Spook.js, which was published at the 2022 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Using Cognitive System Engineering Methods To Inform Human-Robot Collaboration In A Novel Precision Agriculture Application
Abstract:
Operational concepts for novel robotic systems employing a human supervisor require the consideration of enabling technologies, the needs of the human operators, and their interactions. Leveraging the abstraction hierarchy method can support the development of a set of function allocations to inform the operational concept and a research roadmap for novel systems. Reviewing current and envisioned enabling technologies can support downselect of the potential function allocations. The use of operational event sequence diagrams can help to specify information and control requirements and also to identify gaps in the operational concept. The combination of the abstraction hierarchy method and operational event sequence diagrams holds promise for supporting the development of operational concepts for novel robotic systems. As a case study, this talk addresses the use of the methods to inform the specification of the human-robot interaction for a novel robotic Medjool date palm tree thinning system.

Title: Memory-Tight Multi-Challenge Security of Public-Key Encryption
Abstract: We give the first examples of public-key encryption schemes which can be proven to achieve multi-challenge, multi-user CCA security via reductions that are tight in time, advantage, and memory. Our constructions are obtained by applying the KEM-DEM paradigm to variants of Hashed ElGamal and the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation that are augmented by adding uniformly random strings to their ciphertexts and/or keys. Our proofs for the augmented ECIES version of Hashed-ElGamal make use of a new computational Diffie-Hellman assumption wherein the adversary is given access to a pairing to a random group, which we believe may be of independent interest.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Forms of Accountability at the Intersection of Science and Design: Implications from Ecologies of Care Studies in PTSD and Diabetes
Abstract:
Computing holds the promise of alleviating negative impacts of mental illness and chronic disorders by scaling human effort and best medical-practices over time and space. One in five adults is experiencing mental illness and four in ten adults in the US have two or more chronic diseases. The urgent need to manage these conditions calls for robust, and reliable technology that is useful and usable by patients and their caregivers. It calls for accountability at the intersection of science and design. In this talk, I will demonstrate how human-centered computing can leverage the generalizability of theoretical frameworks to design and build computational systems for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Diabetes. I will discuss unique challenges in each clinical domain and will present theory-driven technology interventions that address them. I will also explore how these interventions can lead to improved health and wellness in diverse populations.

Title: C&C On-Demand: An Empirical Study of Web Application Abuse for Malware Command and Control
Abstract: Web applications (apps) provide a wide array of utilities that are being abused by malware authors as a replacement for attacker-deployed C&C servers. Stopping this Web App-based Command and Control (WACC) requires collaboration between Incident Responders (IRs) and web app providers. However, little research has been done to prove that WACC malware are prevalent enough to warrant such an investment. To this end, we designed Marcea, a malware analysis pipeline to study the prevalence of WACC. Marcea revealed 487 WACC malware in 72 families abusing 30 web apps over the last 15 years. Our research uncovered the number of WACC malware increased by 5.5 times since 2020 and that 86% did not need to connect to an attacker-deployed C&C server. Our study uncovered patterns indicating how specific web apps attract or disincentivize WACC malware. Moreover, web app engagement data collected by Marcea suggests that these malware are active enough to produce up to 5,844,144 access points. To date, we have used Marcea to collaborate with the web app providers to take down 70% of the active WACC malware.
Biography: Mingxuan Yao is a fourth year Ph.D. student in the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering(ECE) at Georgia Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Professor Brendan Saltaformaggio in the Cyber Forensics Innovation (CyFI) Lab. He finished his Master Degree in Cybersecurity before that. His research interests lie in cyber attack forensics, and binary analysis techniques. His current research focuses on cyber-threats abusing prestigious web services, aiming to adopt different novel strategies to boost the analysis process.

Title: Axiomatic Hardware-Software Contracts for Security
Abstract: Microarchitectural attacks are side/covert channel attacks which enable leakage/communication as a direct result of hardware optimizations. Secure computation on modern hardware thus requires hardware-software contracts which include in their definition of software-visible state any microarchitectural state that can be exposed via microarchitectural attacks. Defining such contracts has become an active area of research. In this talk, we will present leakage containment models (LCMs)—novel axiomatic hardware-software contracts which support formally reasoning about the security guarantees of programs when they run on particular microarchitectures. Our first contribution is an axiomatic vocabulary for formally defining LCMs, derived from the established axiomatic vocabulary used to formalize processor memory consistency models. Using this vocabulary, we formalize microarchitectural leakage—focusing on leakage through hardware memory systems—so that it can be automatically detected in programs. To illustrate the efficacy of LCMs, we first demonstrate that our leakage definition faithfully captures a sampling of (transient and non-transient) microarchitectural attacks from the literature. Next, we develop a static analysis tool, called Clou, which automatically identifies microarchitectural vulnerabilities in programs given a specific LCM. We use Clou to search for Spectre gadgets in benchmark programs as well as real-world crypto-libraries (OpenSSL and Libsodium), finding new instances of leakage. To promote research on LCMs, we design the Subrosa toolkit for formally defining and automatically evaluating/comparing LCM specifications.
Biography: Nicholas Mosier is a 3rd-year PhD student at Stanford University advised by Caroline Trippel. His research focuses on developing Spectre detection and mitigation techniques that are scalable, efficient, and comprehensive. He is broadly interested in hardware and software security and enjoys bug hunting on the side.

Title: Many Roads Lead To Rome: How Packet Headers Influence DNS Censorship Measurement
Abstract: Internet censorship is widespread, impacting citizens of hundreds of countries around the world. Recent work has developed techniques that can perform widespread, longitudinal measurements of global Internet manipulation remotely and have focused largely on the scale of censorship measurements with minimal focus on reproducibility and consistency.
In this work we explore the role packet headers (e.g., source IP address and source port) have on DNS censorship. By performing a large-scale measurement study building on the techniques deployed by previous and current censorship measurement platforms, we find that choice of ephemeral source port and local source IP address (e.g., x.x.x.7 vs x.x.x.8) influence routing, which in turn influences DNS censorship. We show that 37% of IPs across 56% ASes measured show some change in censorship behavior depending on source port and local source IP. This behavior is frequently all-or-nothing, where choice of header can result in no observable censorship. Such behavior mimics and could be misattributed to geolocation error, packet loss, or network outages. The scale of censorship differences can more than double depending on the lowest 3 bits of the source IP address, consistent with known router load balancing techniques. We also observe smaller-scale censorship variation where only a few domains experience censorship differences based on packet parameters. We lastly find that these variations are persistent; packet retries do not control for observed variation. Our results point to the need for methodological changes in future DNS censorship measurement, which we discuss.
Biography: Abhishek Bhaskar is a 4th year PhD student at SCP working under Dr. Paul Pearce. His research explores the impact of router load balancing on various aspects of network security and measurement. Before beginning his PhD at Georgia Tech, Abhishek obtained his Master's degree from Syracuse University and subsequently worked at GrammaTech.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Daniel Epstein - Towards More Meaningful Personal Tracking
Abstract:
Personal tracking through digital technologies like pedometers, mood monitoring apps, and food journaling apps has great potential to help people begin to change their behaviors, understand their habits, connect with others and advocate for their healthcare. But in practice, they have largely failed to deliver on their promise of helping people derive value from their health and wellbeing data, with majorities abandoning tracking within weeks or even days. A core challenge is that people often view the act of tracking as a meaningless experience, finding that tracking technology prioritizes behavior change over opportunity to create other meaningful experiences through personal satisfaction, connection, and communication. In this talk, I discuss how my research group has approached understanding how to make personal tracking more meaningful, and design strategies that we think provide for more meaningful tracking experiences. I will touch on opportunities for meaningful tracking we are examining in personal, social, and clinical settings.
Speaker Bio:
Daniel Epstein is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine with a courtesy appointment in the Department of Computer Science. His work examines how personal tracking technology can acknowledge and account for the realities of everyday life, designing new technology and studying people's use of current technology. Daniel's work has been published in top HCI venues including CHI, Ubicomp, CSCW, and DIS, receiving multiple awards and nominations. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Washington in 2018.

Title: DeepPhish: Understanding User Trust Towards Artificially Generated Profiles in Online Social Networks
Abstract: Machine learning models are becoming increasingly powerful and are actively deployed in security- and privacy-critical systems; however, this shift has inevitably led to abusive machine learning applications which are lucrative for adversaries and harmful to users. Notably, deepfake-generated content has been increasingly used in social profiles to construct artificial personas which serve disinformation or perform social engineering attacks on other users in online social networks. Many of these victims are attempting to understand and navigate these security and privacy threats for the first time, requiring adjustments in their behavior and responsibilities. In this talk, I will discuss how end-users perceive the novel threat of detecting deepfake social profiles from genuine, human-crafted ones. Through this work, we will discuss what implications exist for content moderators, social media platforms, and future defenses.
Biography: Jaron Mink is a PhD Candidate of the Computer Science Department at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Title: LEAF: Navigating Concept Drift in Cellular Networks
Abstract: Operational networks commonly rely on machine learning models for many tasks, including detecting anomalies, inferring application performance, and forecasting demand. Yet, model accuracy can degrade due to concept drift, whereby the relationship between the features and the target prediction changes. Mitigating concept drift is thus an essential part of operationalizing machine learning models in the context of networking---or regression models in general. Unfortunately, as we show, concept drift cannot be sufficiently mitigated by frequently retraining models using newly available data, and doing so can even degrade model accuracy further. In this paper, we characterize concept drift in a large cellular network for a major metropolitan area in the United States. We find that concept drift occurs across many important key performance indicators (KPIs), independently of the model, training set size, and time interval---thus necessitating practical approaches to detect, explain, and mitigate it. To do so, we develop Local Error Approximation of Features (LEAF). We introduce LEAF and demonstrate its effectiveness on a variety of KPIs and models. LEAF detects drift; explains features and time intervals that most contribute to drift, and mitigates drift using forgetting and over-sampling. We evaluate LEAF against industry-standard mitigation approaches (notably, periodic retraining) with more than four years of cellular KPI data. Our initial tests with a major cellular provider in the US show that LEAF is effective on complex, real-world data. LEAF consistently outperforms periodic and triggered retraining while reducing costly retraining operations.

GVU Center Brown Bag, Brendan David-John: Providing Privacy for Eye-Tracking Data with Applications in XR
Abstract:
Eye-tracking sensors track where a user looks and are being increasingly integrated into mixed-reality devices. Although critical applications are being enabled, there are significant possibilities for violating user security and privacy expectations. There is an appreciable risk of unique user identification from eye-tracking camera images and the resulting eye movement data. Biometric identification would allow an app to connect a user’s personal ID with their work ID without needing their consent, for example. Solutions were explored to address concerns related to the leaking of biometric features through eye-tracking data streams. Privacy mechanisms are introduced to reduce the risk of biometric recognition while still enabling applications of eye-tracking data streams. Gaze data streams can thus be made private while still allowing for applications key to the future of mixed-reality technology, such as animating virtual avatars or prediction models necessary for foveated rendering.

Academia v Industry: The Bright Future of Rowhammer Research
Abstract
We are approaching one decade of (public) Rowhammer research. Do you remember that one time Rowhammer was used to hijack a journalist’s phone remotely? Or that other time when Rowhammer was used to build a 200K USD exploit chain at pwn2own? How about that leaked Proof-of-Concept that was found in a popular exploit kit available on the black market…? While scientific papers on the topic make you feel the apocalypse is near, industry - and the real world - often seem less pessimistic. Who is right? What is going wrong? And where is the disconnect coming from? In this talk, I investigate and share my perspectives on both worlds.
Biography
Victor van der Veen is an engineer in Qualcomm’s Product Security Group. Before joining Qualcomm, he obtained his PhD in the VUSec group at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He was among the first to publicly report Rowhammer bit flips in mobile devices. At Qualcomm, he continued his work on this fundamental issue in modern DRAM. In his ongoing attempts to bring academia and industry closer together, he helped some of our best next-generation scientists to publish their seminal Rowhammer research. Although he is currently trying to move to a different field, his past is starting to catch up and Rowhammer keeps coming back at him.

GVU Center Brown Bag, Kristin Williams: An Upcycled IoT: Creating Tomorrow's Internet of Things Out of Today's Household Possessions
Abstract:
The Internet-of-Things (IoT) promises to enhance even the most mundane of objects with computational properties. Yet, IoT has largely focused on new devices while ignoring the home’s many existing possessions. Requiring households to replace their possessions to adopt IoT yields substantial costs. Beyond financial, these include waste, work to arrange and orchestrate objects to suit households, and attention investment to acquire new skills. To address these costs, this project worked with 10 American families to design an upcycled approach to IoT that makes use of existing household possessions and then built a system responsive to these findings. The results 1) describe patterns of families’ socio-material practices, 2) develop a framework for designing lightweight modification, and 3) presents The IoT Codex—a book of programmable and inexpensive, battery-free interactive devices—to support customizing everyday objects with software and web services using stickers. The presented work offers a lightweight approach to end user programming of everyday objects for customizing IoT to suit idiosyncratic socio-material practices.
Speaker Bio:
Kristin Williams is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in Emory University's College of Arts and Sciences. Her research focuses on making programming the Internet of Things approachable to casual end user programmers. This work builds on Kristin's longstanding interests in agency, DIY publishing, and access to information. In the past, Kristin has worked closely with community organizations to shape and evaluate assistive technologies for individuals with visual and cognitive disabilities, managed an archive of Soviet dissident literature on the political abuse of psychiatry, and created a 10+ year book project on Central Asian civil society as a Peace Corps volunteer in Kazakhstan. She has a PhD from Carnegie Mellon University's Human Compter Interaction Institute, an MS in Human-Computer Interaction from both Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Maryland, College Park and a BA in Philosophy from Reed College. She was a 2021 EECS Rising Star, an NSF EAPSI Fellow, and an AAUW Career Development Grantee.

GVU Center Brown Bag, Marynel Vázquez: Multi-Party Human-Robot Interaction: Towards Robots with Increased Social Context Awareness
Abstract:
Many real-world applications require that robots handle the complexity of multi-party social encounters, e.g., delivery robots may need to navigate through crowds, robots in manufacturing settings may need to coordinate their actions with those of human coworkers, and robots in educational environments may help multiple people practice and improve their skills. How can we enable robots to effectively take part in these social interactions? At first glance, multi-party interactions may be seen as a trivial generalization of one-on-one human-robot interactions, suggesting no special consideration. Unfortunately, this approach is limited in practice because it ignores higher-order effects, like group factors, that often drive human behavior in multi-party Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).
In this talk, I will describe two research directions that we believe are important to advance multi-party HRI. The first direction focuses on understanding group dynamics and social group phenomena from an experimental perspective. The other one focuses on leveraging graph state abstractions and structured data-driven methods for reasoning about social contexts, which include individual, interpersonal and group-level factors relevant to human-robot interactions. As part of this talk, I will also describe our recent efforts to scale HRI data collection for early system development and testing via online interactive surveys. We have begun to explore this idea in the context of social robot navigation but, thanks to advances in game development engines, it could be easily applied to other HRI application domains.
Speaker Bio:
Marynel Vázquez is an Assistant Professor in Yale’s Computer Science Department, where she leads the Interactive Machines Group. Her research focuses on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), especially in multi-party and group settings. Marynel is a recipient of the 2022 NSF CAREER Award and two Amazon Research Awards. Her work has been recognized with nominations to paper awards at RO-MAN 2016, IROS 2018, HRI 2021, and RO-MAN 2022. Prior to Yale, Marynel was a Post-Doctoral Scholar at the Stanford Vision & Learning Lab and obtained her M.S. and Ph.D. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, where she was a collaborator of Disney Research. Before then, she received her bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Universidad Simón Bolívar in Caracas, Venezuela.

SCP Faculty Recruiting Candidate Seminar
Title: Analyzing and Securing Software with Robust and Generalizable Learning
Abstract: Software is powering every aspect of our society, but it remains plagued with errors and prone to critical failures and security breaches. Program analysis has been a predominant technique for building trustworthy software. However, traditional approaches rely on hand-curated rules tailored for specific analysis tasks and thus require significant manual effort to tune for different applications. While recent machine learning-based approaches have shown some early promise, they, too, tend to learn spurious features and overfit to specific tasks without understanding the underlying program semantics.
In this talk, I will describe my research on building machine learning (ML) models toward learning program semantics so they can remain robust against transformations in program syntax and generalize to various program analysis tasks and security applications. The corresponding research tools, such as XDA, Trex, StateFormer, and NeuDep, have outperformed commercial tools and prior arts by up to 117x in speed and by 35% in precision and have helped identify security vulnerabilities in real-world firmware that run on billions of devices. To ensure the developed ML models are robust and generalizable, I will briefly describe my research on building testing and verification frameworks for checking the safety properties of deep learning systems. The corresponding research tools, such as DeepXplore, DeepTest, ReluVal, and Neurify, have been adopted and followed up by the industry (e.g., in TensorFuzz built by Google), been covered in media such as Scientific American, IEEE Spectrum, Newsweek, and TechRadar, and inspired over thousands of follow-up projects.
Bio: Kexin Pei is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Columbia University, advised by Suman Jana and Junfeng Yang. His research lies at the intersection of security, software engineering, and machine learning, with a focus on building machine-learning tools that utilize program structure and behavior to analyze and secure software. His research has received the Best Paper Award in SOSP, a Distinguished Artifact Award, been featured in CACM Research Highlight, and won CSAW Applied Research Competition Runner-Up. He was part of the learning for code team when he interned at Google Brain, building program analysis tools based on large language models.

Title: Protecting User Privacy by Helping Developers
Abstract: Data has driven many technological advancements, while the ubiquitous collection and sharing of data has caused a privacy trust crisis in our society. Developers play a critical role in making apps that respect user privacy, yet many lack the necessary awareness, knowledge, and time to ensure their apps meet privacy requirements. How can we support average developers (who are oftentimes not privacy experts) in building privacy-friendly apps? In this talk, I will discuss how my research at the intersection of Privacy, HCI, and Software Engineering is engaging developers to better protect user privacy. I will talk about two main threads of my work: (1) empirical HCI studies to identify the challenges developers face in handling privacy requirements, and (2) system building work to tackle the identified challenges by building IDE plugins and breaking down privacy responsibilities into lightweight code annotating tasks. In the final remarks, I will discuss my future research agenda of creating a safe and trustworthy world by helping developers.

Title: Algorithmic Foundation of Fast Stencil Computation and Parallel Paging
Abstract: In this talk, I will present two of our recent results. First, I will give an overview of our recent algorithmic development on performing general linear stencil computations significantly faster than state-of-the-art algorithms. Second, I will present an algorithmic foundation of parallel paging.
A stencil computation applies a given stencil (a pattern to compute the value of a cell from values of its nearby cells at previous time steps) to the cells in a spatial grid for some given number of time steps. Such computations arise in many areas of scientific computing, including the simulation of physical systems, traffic flows, meteorology, stochastic and fractional differential equations, chemistry, erosion modeling, fluid dynamics, quantitative finance, and even cellular automata.
I will show an exciting connection from stencil computation to random walks, n-body computation, and polynomial multiplication. All our algorithms have asymptotically lower computational complexity than all existing algorithms for general linear stencils and are highly parallelizable.
In the second part of my talk, I will present an algorithmic foundation of parallel paging. Classical problems such as paging have been very well understood in the sequential setting for decades. However, the paging problem has remained wide open for more than two decades in the parallel setting. In the parallel paging problem, p processors share a cache (small, fast memory) of size k. The goal is to partition the cache among the processors over time to minimize their average or maximum completion time. I will present tight upper and lower bounds of \Theta(\log p) on the competitive ratio with O(1) resource augmentation.
Bio: Rathish Das is currently a lecturer (US equivalent: tenure-track assistant professor) at the University of Liverpool, UK. Before that, he was a postdoc at the University of Waterloo. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Stony Brook University. His research interests are primarily in the theoretical and practical aspects of high-performance computing (HPC) and big data that are strongly motivated by today’s multiprocessor systems. He also designs approximation and randomized algorithms for scheduling, graph, and computational geometry problems.
Notable recognition he has received for his work includes the junior researcher award from Stony Brook University and three outstanding paper awards from SPAA 2021 and SPAA 2022.

Title: Combining Data and Models for Scientific Machine Learning Methodologies and Inverse Design
Abstract: I present methodologies that combine data and models to accelerate simulations and enable inverse design via scientific machine learning and data-driven approximate solvers. Inverse design is the direct optimization of a target property; it has the potential to automatically discover engineering solutions of real-world problems. However, it is limited by the simulation capabilities of physical phenomena. The centerpiece of these approaches is the creation of data- and resource-efficient global surrogate models that are repeatedly called in the optimization loop.
On the one hand, data-driven models are most often very fast to evaluate, and they do not require a complete knowledge of the process being optimized. Unfortunately, as the number of real-world design parameters increases, these models may require unreasonable amounts of data and resources to be trained accurately. Using scientific machine learning, I show results of an active learning algorithm that reduces the number of training points needed by an order of magnitude to perform inverse design with PDE constraints. By adding information from the physical model via a solver layer in a neural network, one can save an additional order of magnitude in data to perform inverse design. These surrogate models are Physics-Enhanced Deep Surrogates. I also show how scientific machine learning can be leveraged for PDE-constrained inverse design using Physics-Informed Neural Networks and multi-fidelity data.
On the other hand, in many applications, there exist physical models where the simulations are accurate enough to result in a meaningful design, but these simulations may be too resource-intensive to run the optimization process. For example, this is the case for metasurface design–optical devices that present both subwavelength aperiodic patterns and a thousands-of-wavelengths-long diameter. Using a data-driven approximate solver, I show theory and experimental results of large-scale metasurface designs which were enabled by an approximate solver accelerated by a surrogate model; I also show applications of data-driven optics.
Bio: Raphaël Pestourie is a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He earned his PhD in Applied Mathematics and an AM in Statistics from Harvard University in 2020. His research interest is inverse design via scientific machine learning and large-scale electromagnetic design, and he was invited to present his scientific machine learning work at multiple upcoming conferences: SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering in Amsterdam, SIAM Conference on Optimization in Seattle, and ECCOMAS-IACM Sicily. Originally from France, Raphaël came to Harvard as an Arthur Sachs Fellow selected by the French Fulbright Commission. While at Harvard, he served as a Resident Affiliate at Quincy House, where he lived among and mentored dozens of undergraduate students.

Whispers of Night: Majid Araim, Benjamin Shirley -- Whispers of Night is an ongoing musical collaboration between Majid Araim and Benjamin Shirley, a multi-instrumental duo rooted in the sounds of the South and dedicated to exploration, improvisation, and creative expression. After almost a decade of collaboration and tours across the United States and Europe, the duo honed a sympathetic and dynamic musical bond, persistently seeking to cultivate novel concepts of composition, recording, and presentation in musical practice. Since 2014, Whispers in the Night developed a conception of improvised music nurturing the sound worlds of acoustic instruments such as fiddle, mandolin, cello, banjo, harmonica, drums, and voice, bringing to the fore their resonance and timbres with the elemental feeling of the music traditions of the southern Appalachian region.
Doctor Calico. Here’s what you need to know about Doctor Calico: A child prodigy on piano and drums at four, he played glockenspiel in the orchestra by six. This led to experiments with tape and turntables by age eight, then programming BASIC on a Commodore 64 and analog synthesizers utilizing subtractive synthesis at 10. Calico produced his first catalog by age 15 in a home-built, four-track studio called Soundworks, for which he received the Governor’s Award in Art. He started producing records, then signed a publishing deal for a 300-song catalog by age 18 with MCA.
Calico has produced many major label artists including Organized Noize, Akon, X-Clan, Toni Braxton, and Elephant Man. In addition to being self-taught in more than 100 instruments, he started the award-winning, state grant-funded Renaissance Kids program for College Park schools. Additionally, Calico founded a 60-week residency in 2015 at the Magnolia House in Historic West End Atlanta with Dr. Al-Yasha Williams of Spelman University.
Doctor Calico currently works as a DJ and electronic musician at Underground Atlanta’s arts facility and performs at various venues in the city. Recent accomplishments include going viral as an influencer on Instagram by sharing live musical performances and archival content. He has racked up more than a million views on the self-made platform with no advertising or paid partnerships.
William Barrow. Born in western Kentucky, William Barrow works with oftentimes outdated electronics to convey contemporary concepts through sound and video. He produces videos and electronic sounds as a result of experimentation with children’s toys, audio and video tape machines, and synthesizers, creating interconnected systems of pre-existing and homemade instruments.
Barrow studied at Murray State University, earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts with an emphasis in video and performance. There he was a manager of the university galleries and the sculpture studio assistant for four years, as well as being the head of 3D printing operations for the Summer Art Workshop. He has worked in collaboration with dancers, electronic and acoustic musicians, and provided live sound for Butoh dance workshops and outdoor yoga classes. Since moving to Atlanta, Barrow has joined the Atlanta Improvisers Orchestra (AIO) and worked closely with experimental performance and event venue No Tomorrow.
Adia Davina is an experimental, independent and multi-disciplinary artist based in Atlanta. Currently she is pursuing an interdisciplinary degree at Georgia State University, as well as engaging in collaborations with the theatre department as a playwright and wardrobe assistant.
Davina has performed in Ghana with Rakaba, a west African dance company, sung in numerous choirs, trained at John Robert Powers and performed, recorded and toured the United States with artist Raury. Her unique vocals can be heard echoing through his hit song, and her first feature, “Gods Whisper.” Her last performance with him was at Coachella 2017. Davina currently works as a stylist and make-up artist and directs, writes and produces music.
Rafiana is a multidisciplinary artist of Puerto Rican and American descent from Atlanta producing works in the performing arts, music, film, and painting. They have shared the stage with Grammy-nominated performers, as well as self-professed “non-performers.”
Rafiana's work focuses on improvisation and the many ways in which that practice collides with elements of form. After graduating from Georgia State, their work became largely based in an abstraction of poetry as it related to the body, the physical world, movement, dance and music.
The most recent live works include large-scale experimental theater pieces in which an orchestra scores movements and actions loosely choreographed with an emphasis on improvisational “moods” created by various elements in each scene.
Rafiana designs many of the aesthetic elements of their theater world, which involves creating costumes, props, object curation, painting, sound design, and lighting. The more recent themes of their work have been rooted in exploitation of the self, exploring variations on the concept of clowning and experiments with abstraction of samples to environments and material played on the midi guitar.

CSE Distinguished Guest Lecture: Doug Kothe
The School of Computational Science and Engineering invites you for a distinguished guest lecture from Doug Kothe, Associate Laboratory Director of Computing and Computational Sciences Directorate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
Who: Doug Kothe; Oak Ridge National Laboratory and U.S. Department of Energy; Associate Laboratory Director of Computing and Computational Sciences Directorate (ORNL) and Director of Exascale Computing Project (DOE)
When: Tuesday, March 7, 1:00 – 2:00

Title: Dawn of the Exascale Computing Era
Abstract: With the recent arrival of the Frontier system in the US at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and with the applications and software technologies under development as part of the US Department of Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing Project (ECP) now poised to exploit Frontier’s capabilities to tackle problems of national and international interest, the highly anticipated “dawn of the exascale computing era” is here. This is indeed a very exciting time for the world’s high-performance computing (HPC) community, as many exascale uncertainties and challenges over the past decade or so have been surpassed. Given the concerted US DOE investments in the ECP and architectural co-design embodied in Frontier, this exascale system is and will continue to be “used, useful, and affordable” over its lifetime. Exascale-capable applications are a foundational element of the ECP and the vehicle for delivery of mission need on targeted exascale systems such as Frontier. The ECP’s mission need application projects, each addressing an exascale challenge problem—a high-priority strategic problem of national interest that is intractable without at least 50 times the computational power of the HPC systems available at the project’s inception in 2016. Exascale applications are built on underlying software technologies, which play an essential supporting role in application efficacy on computing systems. The ECP’s ST effort is developing an expanded and vertically integrated software stack that includes advanced mathematical libraries, extreme-scale programming environments, development tools, visualization libraries, and the software infrastructure to support large-scale data management and data science for science and security applications. The ST efforts complement and integrate into the broader scientific software ecosystem that includes capabilities from industry and the broader HPC R&D community. Architectural details of the Frontier system will be given along with the challenges overcome in readying traditional and new exascale software technologies and applications as part of the ECP.

Title: Accelerating Discovery through Knowledge, Data & Learning
Abstract: With rapidly growing amounts of experimental data, machine learning is increasingly crucial for automating scientific data analysis. However, many real-world workflows demand expert-in-the-loop attention and require models that not only interface with data, but also with experts and domain knowledge. My research develops full stack solutions that enable scientists to scalably extract insights from diverse and messy experimental data with minimal supervision. My approaches learn from both data and expert knowledge, while exploiting the right level of domain knowledge for generalization. In this talk, I will present progress towards developing automated scientist-in-the-loop solutions, including methods that automatically discover meaningful structure from data, such as self-supervised keypoints from videos of diverse behaving organisms; and using these interpretable structures to inject domain knowledge into the learning process, such as guiding representation learning using symbolic programs of behavioral features computed from keypoints. I work closely with domain experts, such as behavioral neuroscientists, to integrate these methods in real-world workflows. My aim is to enable AI that collaborates with scientists to accelerate the scientific process.
Bio: Jennifer Sun is a Ph.D. candidate in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Caltech, advised by Professors Pietro Perona and Yisong Yue. Her research focuses on developing scientist-in-the-loop computational systems that automatically convert experimental data into insight with minimal expert effort. She aims to accelerate scientific discovery and optimize expert attention in real-world workflows, tackling challenges including annotation efficiency, model interpretability and generalization, and semantic structure discovery. Beyond her research work, she has organized multiple workshops to facilitate connections across fields at top AI conferences, such as CVPR, and she has received multiple awards, such as best student paper at CVPR 2021.

GVU Center Brown Bag, Mustafa Naseem: Patriarchy and Health: Designing Technologies for Men to Improve Women’s Health in Pakistan
Abstract:
This talk will address the design challenges and opportunities in creating health technologies for men to improve the health of women in religiously conservative, patriarchal, and low-income societies. In this talk, I will share findings from the deployment of a speech-based service called Super Abbu (Super Dad) designed to connect expectant fathers to doctors and to each other. Over a period of 71 days, the service reached upwards of 20,000 users who spent almost 400 thousand minutes on the platform. Through a critical examination of cultural and societal factors, such as traditional gender roles, stigma towards sexual health information-seeking, and limited access to resources, I will highlight key considerations for designing effective and culturally sensitive health technologies for this population. The goal of this talk is to provide insights and recommendations for designers, researchers, and practitioners to create health technologies that are inclusive, accessible, and effective for users, regardless of their cultural, social, and economic backgrounds.

Title: Towards Data-Driven Modeling in Large-Scale Naturalistic Neuroscience
Abstract: Neuroscience is currently undergoing an explosion in the availability of large-scale brain activity data, so the major challenge no longer lies in data collection, but in deriving understanding from this abundant stream of complex, high-dimensional, noisy data with methods that fully leverage its potential. How can we understand neural representations and infer computational principles from large-scale brain activity data directly? My research group will develop the theory, modeling, and machine learning techniques needed to tackle these challenges, and will provide algorithmically and computationally precise accounts of information processing in the brain. Progress in this research could advance our understanding of biological intelligence and the neural basis of neuropsychiatric disorders, inform novel treatments and neural prostheses, and lead to the development of new approaches to generating machine intelligence.
In this talk, I will present lines of previous and proposed research that highlight the potential of this vision. First, I will present a line of data-driven modeling that revealed the representational structure in the high-level visual cortex and led to the discovery of a neural population selectively responsive to images of food. Second, I will present a modeling framework, called response-optimization, for inferring computations directly from brain activity data with minimal apriori hypotheses. Here, we trained artificial neural network (ANN) models directly to predict the brain activity related to viewing natural images. We then developed techniques for interpreting the networks and characterizing the emergent functional capabilities of these brain response-optimized networks. This work highlights how models trained to capture human brain activity can spontaneously recapitulate human-like behavior. Third, I will present my work on developing neural network models of brain responses across wide-spread cortical regions to dynamic, multi-modal stimuli like movies, with an integrated modeling approach that captured visual attention, multi-sensory auditory-visual interactions and temporal context. Finally, I will propose future directions for leveraging these data-driven computational tools toward i) understanding the representational structure underlying our capacity for high-level cognitive processes like social perception, ii) understanding the granularity of similarity between biological and artificial neural networks, iii) understanding the functional consequences of brain alignment in ANN representations, and iv) understanding not just how the brain is organized or how a process works but fundamentally, why the brain works the way it does.
Bio: Meenakshi Khosla is a postdoctoral associate in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences department at MIT. Her research interests lie at the intersection of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and large-scale data analysis. Her current projects focus on leveraging large-scale data to develop interpretable machine learning tools for understanding structured neural representations and computations in biological systems. Previously, Meenakshi received her PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from Cornell University, where she worked broadly at the intersection of machine learning and neuroimaging, developing predictive models to understand the distinctive characteristics of the brains of people affected with different mental disorders.

Title: Foundation Models for Robustness to Distribution Shift
Abstract: Machine learning systems are not robust—they suffer large drops in accuracy when deployed in different environments from what they were trained on. In this talk, I show that the foundation model paradigm—adapting models that are pretrained on broad unlabeled data—is a principled solution that leads to state-of-the-art robustness. I will focus on the key ingredients: how we should pretrain and adapt models for robustness. (1) First, I show that contrastive pretraining on unlabeled data learns transferable representations that improves accuracy even on domains where we had no labels. We explain why pretraining works in a very different way from some classical intuitions of collapsing representations (domain invariance). Our theory predicts phenomena on real datasets, and leads to improved methods. (1) Next, I will show that the standard approach of adaptation (updating all the model's parameters) can distort pretrained representations and perform poorly out-of-distribution. Our theoretical analysis leads to better methods for adaptation and state-of-the-art accuracies on ImageNet and in applications such as satellite remote sensing, wildlife conservation, and radiology.
Bio: Ananya Kumar is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University, advised by Percy Liang and Tengyu Ma. His work focuses on representation learning, foundation models, and reliable machine learning. His papers have been recognized with several Spotlight and Oral presentations at NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR, and his research is supported by a Stanford Graduate Fellowship.

GVU Center Brown Bag, Research & Engagement Grant Winners: Deep Thinking About Deepfake Videos
Abstract:
“Deepfakes” are videos in which the (usually human) subject of a video has been digitally altered to appear to do or say something that they never actually did or said. Sometimes these manipulations produce innocuous novelties (e.g., testing what it would look like if Will Smith had been cast as “Neo” in the film The Matrix), but far more dangerous use cases have been observed (e.g., producing fake footage of Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which he instructs Ukrainian military forces to surrender on the battlefield). Generating the knowledge and tools necessary to defend against potential harms these videos could impose is likely to rely on contributions from a broad coalition of disciplines, many of which are represented in the GVU. In this week’s Brown Bag presentation, we will offer some real-time demonstrations of deepfake technology and present findings from our work that has largely focused on investigating the psychological factors influencing deepfake detection.
Speaker Bios:
John Stasko is a Regents Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he has been on the faculty since 1989.

-
GT Offer Guidelines - Communicate your acceptance or refusal of a job offer to employers as promptly as possible, so they can notify other candidates that they are still being considered or that the position is filled. If you need an extension, please request one from an employer. The Institute and the College of Computing use the same guidelines for offers extended to students for internships, co-ops, and full-time positions. Visit the GT Career Center to see the guidelines each semester.
-
Reneging on Offers - If you have accepted an offer and the employer has confirmed their offer, you should cease all job search activities. Reneging a job offer is a serious issue and should never be done lightly. The College of Computing has built relationships with our employers, and the actions of one student can affect that employer’s relationship with all other students. Most importantly, reneging always has a negative impact on peers who also applied to the same positions. It is ethically appropriate that if you have accepted an offer and the employer has confirmed your acceptance, you should cease all job search activities. Students who renege on an offer of employment will be subject to disciplinary action including loss of CoC Career Services opportunities including access to jobs board, CoC Career advising and workshops, and the College of Computing Career Fairs. Additional consequences may also be applied by the GT Career Center. Read the Student Interview Policy.

Funding Sources
Policies regarding GTAs and TAs
This policy document is intended for two groups: 1) faculty requesting GTA support for their courses, 2) PhD students admitted Fall 2011 and later whose degree requirement thus serving twice as a GTA.
For more information on demographics, admissions, and time-to-degree in our doctoral students in our programs, go to the Doctoral Program Statistics page in the Institute's public data portal, LITE. Use the search functions to find your program.
For information on travel funding, please visit our Graduate Student Council and Graduate Program Office Travel funds page.
Basic policy for faculty
One GTA or grader per 25 students, when needed to provide a superior educational experience for students and to leverage faculty time.
Basic policy for PhD students
You are expected to complete one GTA by the end of your third year of study, and the second by the end of your fifth year.
Stipend Levels
Students who receive stipends will be paid at the following rates:
- MS Students (33% FTE) - $1050 per month, 4.5 months per semester.
- Pre-Qualifications Ph.D. Students (45% FTE) - $2475 per month, 4.5 months per semester
- Post-Qualifications Ph.D. Students (50% FTE) - $2750 per month, 4.5 months per semester.
Additional information about Graduate Assistantships, fellowships, loans and off-campus employment options is available on the Office of Graduate Studies site.
Concerning PhD GTAs
PhD students covered by the GTA requirement are expected to complete one GTA by the end of the third year and the second by the end of the fifth year. (Applies to PhD students entering in August 2011 or later).
If a PhD student at the start of their third year, in consultation with their advisor, does not have a plan to GTA in the third year, they may be assigned to GTA a course for which they are qualified and that does not have a PhD GTA. This applies also to the fifth year.
Serving as a GTA satisfies the 2-semester requirement only if course enrollment is at least 25, unless prior approval has been given by the faculty member overseeing GTA assignments. See the FAQs for further restrictions on what courses can count toward the requirement.
Students doing a GTA for the first time must simultaneously take and pass GTA Preparation - CETL 8000 - COC; for the second time, Special Topics - CETL 8801 - COC. Exemptions from taking these two TA classes will be granted only in exceptional circumstances (such as someone with many years of full time teaching experience), and are at the discretion of the PhD coordinator. Exemptions are not granted from the TA requirement, and only teaching or TAing for IC during the two-term academic year fulfills the requirement.
PhD GTAs are preferably used to support graduate rather than undergraduate courses.
Generally only one PhD GTA per course. Additional support is generally provided by MS or BS students.
PhD GRA students are paid to GTA with the expectation of either 18 or 20 hours of work each week (18 hours pre-quals, 20 hours post-quals, including exam week) - which is thus the maximum number of hours that a PhD student fulfilling a GTA requirement can be expected to work in their GTA role.
PhD students admitted prior to 2011 (when the two GTA requirement took effect) who have not opted into the requirement by serving as a GTA twice while being paid as a GRA will only in exceptional circumstances be hired by IC as a GTA. They will be paid at the 37.5% level, and are expected to work no more than 15 hours per week, including exam week.
Concerning MS GTAs
MS GTAs are employed as an MS I, with a stipend per month for 4 months, plus tuition waiver. The stipend rates are reviewed and adjusted by the school each year. The student is responsible for fees and any tuition supplement, such as for the MS-HCI degree. They are expected to work no more than 15 hours per week during the semester, including exam week.
Concerning BS (undergrad) Graders
BS graders are paid on a sliding scale of $7.75 an hour plus $0.65 more for each previous course TA’d, for up to 15 hours per week. The course instructor signs a biweekly time sheet recording actual hours worked.
BS Graders are hired via email to Monica Sweat, sweat@cc.gatech.edu.
Concerning Conflicts of Interest in Grading
It is important that TA’s and graders work together with the course instructor to avoid conflicts of interest during grading. A grader or TA has a conflict of interest in grading any family member, close friend, boyfriend, girlfriend, or small-group partner on projects in other classes. This is not an exhaustive list of possible conflicts of interest. When in doubt, it is best to avoid the perceived conflict. In the case where there are two or more TA’s or graders for a course, they should re-balance who grades which student. If there is just one TA or grader for the course, it is the responsibility of the course instructor to grade those students for which there is a conflict of interest. These guidelines apply to all TA’s and graders, whether they are undergraduates, MS students or PhD students. It is the responsibility of all those involved in teaching and grading to explicitly discuss potential conflicts.
Note to Faculty
The best way for you to ensure high-quality GTA/TA help is to directly recruit students. Undergrad courses are often staffed with undergrads that previously earned A’s in the course or MS students who earned A’s in the graduate version of the course or took a comparable course at their undergraduate school.
Be careful about making final commitments if there is uncertainty about the course enrollment! Enrollment refers to enrollment after DROP/ADD is over, Friday of the first week of classes. Remember that enrollment often drops during the first week - students often register for more classes than they plan to take, or may drop your course if the wait list for another course clears.
Olufisayo Omojokun has a sign-up mechanism for undergrad students interested in TAing specific undergrad courses. If you use undergrad TAs and want help from Fisayo in finding TAs, you should let him know at least one month before the end of the previous semester.
When you speak with potential undergrad graders, emphasize that they will not always be called upon to work the maximum number of hours per week, so they should not expect to earn the maximum amount each week. You should not automatically approve 15 hours each week.
If your enrollment is close to a break-point for an additional GTA or grader, it may be possible to have a grader for a number of hours for the entire semester that is less than the maximum. Talk with the faculty member overseeing GTA assignments.
Elaboration in the Form of FAQS
Q: If a student has been supported by IC for two (or more) semesters (and hence has been a GTA for those semesters) and then moves into a GRA position, does the student now need to do two additional GTAs?
A: No. The degree requirement is to GTA twice. Period. The degree requirement does not say that you have to GTA twice while being a GRA.
Q: If student has already done two GTAs and is now being supported by IC because the advisor has run out of funds, is student expected to GTA?
A: Yes
Q: What if the advisor’s funding for a student runs out after 2 or 3 years, so the student has 2 or more years to go. The advisor may have funding in a new area in which the student is not interested. What happens?
A: This is the joint responsibility of both the advisor and student. The student may have to GRA on the advisor’s new project while completing their dissertation, rather than being a GTA supported by IC.
Q: Must the classes for which a student GTAs be taught by an IC faculty member during the academic year?
A: Yes, effective fall semester 2014. The class must be in IC, because it is IC that is providing the back-up funding for the student. In this context, think of GTAing an IC course as paying the insurance policy premium to guarantee student funding if the advisor cannot support the student. Thus, if your advisor has a fractional appointment in IC and does not teach IC courses with an enrollment of 25 or more, you will need to GTA courses not taught by your advisor. Summer school GTAing does not count for a similar reason, because IC is not financially involved in summer school payment of faculty or GTAs. MOOM GTAing does not count for the same reason.
Q: May a student GTA for two courses during the same semester?
A: No, effective fall semester 2014. The time demands of managing two courses, each with 25 or more students, places an unreasonable burden on the GTA, and can be unfair to students in the two classes by spreading the GTA out “too thin”.
Q: If student is not supported as a GRA and has to GTA, what is the stipend?
A: Same as it would be otherwise. 45% prior to passing quals, 50% after that. For students admitted prior to the 2011 start of the two GTA requirement who have NOT opted into the requirement, 37.5%
Q: During what years is it recommended to GTA?
A: As per the School of IC’s “Doctoral Academic Policies and Procedures” – a document approved by the faculty – the first should be completed no later than during the third year, and the second no later than the fifth year. If there are difficulties in so doing, then the advisor should have a prior discussion with the faculty member having oversight of GTA assignments.
Q: If a student successfully defends and is about to graduate but has not done the two GTAs, what happens?
A: Doing two GTAs is a degree requirement, so the student cannot graduate without having met this requirement.
Q: Student has NSF or other fellowship. Must student do the two GTAs?
A: Yes. Doing two GTAs is a degree requirement, so the student cannot graduate without having met this requirement.
Q: What if a student needs to GTA, but no one wants the student as a GTA - maybe the student did a bad job on their first GTA, maybe English is a problem?
A: This is first and foremost the responsibility of the student’s advisor. In most cases the student GTAs with the advisor. If not, the advisor works with the student to find a suitable GTA position. In the limit, the School assigns the student to GTA a specific course. The advisor, in consultation with the student and the faculty member in charge of GTA assignments, will have first taken steps to ensure that the student has remedied whatever the issues might have been.
Q: Do students normally GTA for a course taught by their advisor.
A: Yes, this is the norm but is not required. A student might benefit by GTAing some other course.
Q: Are there limits on the class size of the class being GTAd in order for it to count?
A: Yes, the size must be 25 or more unless explicit prior approval for a smaller class has been given.
Q: Can a student graduate if they have TA'd twice, but have failed one or both of the
mandatory TA classes?
A: No. If a student fails one of the courses, they must retake it and pass in order to graduate.
Q: Does being 'instructor of record' count as one of the TAships for this requirement?
A: Yes, teaching a course rather than being GTA satisfies one GTA requirement.
Q: Would a student who is either a GTA or an instructor of record who has considerable prior teaching experience in high school, college or other venues still have to take the appropriate first/second TA class?
A: Almost certainly yes. Exemptions from taking the TA classes will be granted only in exceptional circumstances (such as someone with many years full time teaching experience), and are at the discretion of the PhD coordinator. Exemptions are not granted from the TA requirement.
Q: Is there an expectation that the TA provide at least one lecture to the class? If so, should the professor be expected to watch and critique the lecture or can it be, for example while the professor is traveling.
A: This is not required, but some faculty may choose to do so, and GTAs should request to do should if they want to have this experience
Q: Does TAing an undergrad course count? Is there a preference, at least, for TAing grad courses?
A: Yes it does count. There is a preference that PhD students GTA grad courses, since MS students often are able to GTA undergrad courses. But this is not an absolute.
Graduate Student Council and Graduate Programs Office Travel Funds
What is this all about?
The Graduate Student Council has developed a policy for disbursing conference travel support for graduate students in the College of Computing (Masters and PhD students). The funding policy was developed with the goal of ensuring funds do not run out early in an academic year and to ensure students can apply for and be granted funding in a fair way.
GSC in conjunction with the Graduate Programs Office implemented this proposal in Spring 2007 to see how it worked in practice. The system was found to be fair and just, thus the policy continues to support travel for the CoC for graduate students. Each year funds will vary according to the budget for that fiscal year but the principles of disbursal will remain the same.
**If you require funding, please familiarize yourself with the application process below.**
Basic Policy Outline
There are two processes by which students can obtain travel funding
- The Graduate Programs Office disburses up to 50 small grants (up to $600 each) per year. Both Masters and PhD students in the CoC are eligible for this type of funding.
- A subcommittee of the Graduate Student Council issues up to 5 large grants ($1000 each) per year. Only PhD students are eligible for this type of funding.
Students may apply for both types of funding. However, if a student is awarded a $600 grant, s/he is ineligible to receive a $1000 grant. Similarly, if a student is awarded a $1000 grant, s/he is ineligible to receive a $600 grant.
Both policies are subject to change at any time. If you have questions about the funding policy, please email Dimetra Harris for questions about $600 grants or gsc-travel@cc.gatech.edu for questions about $1000 grants.
Application Rules for $600 grants
For $600 grants, GPO will handle the applications. To ensure even distribution of funds throughout the year, funds have been divided into monthly pots. e.g. Jan, Feb, March etc will each have a pot of money. Money will be essentially, the (total travel funds pots for the year minus the money for the large grants)/(12). All questions should be directed to Dimetra Harris.
$600 Grant Basic Rules:
- Students will only receive funding once per year – if a student has already received funding s/he will be put on a waitlist and if at the end of a month, there is money remaining s/he will be granted the funds. (This is to ensure funds are not left over).
- Students who are not presenting papers are given preference (since if you are presenting your advisor will likely support you)
If you are presenting a paper and your advisor will not support you, you can apply but must provide a letter from your advisor or email saying they will not support you.
- Students should indicate if they have applied to other sources of funding.
- Funds will be given on first come first serve basis if there is money available.
- Students will be allowed to apply from two months before the month their conference is in right up until the month their conference is in
e.g. If you have a conference in March – you can apply in Jan and Feb or March.
- For each month if there is money left over it rolls over to the next month (This will ensure money balances out over the months where there are fewer conferences and months where there are more conferences). Rollovers happen on the 1st of a month e.g. on Dec 1, the money for December rolls into January etc.
- Funds are deducted from the month in which the conference is held.
- Students may apply for both the $600 and $1000 grant; however, students who receive a GSC or GPO travel grant are ineligible to receive the other travel grant.
To apply, the following completed and signed documents should be submitted to Dimetra Harris.
- Complete in full, Travel Authority (TA).
- If you are employed by Georgia Tech, you can access the TA form after signing into TechWorks. Select Travel & Expense Reimbursement, then Create New Travel Auth.
- To download a paper form, access Travel Forms then select Travel Authority Form.
- Signed by student's Advisor or Division Chair.
- Complete in full, top portion Graduate Student Travel Form.
- Trip dates; conference name; location; etc.
- The graduate programs travel form does not require Advisor or Division Chair signature unless they provide funds for the trip.
- Signature of Division Chair or Advisor at # 1, 2, 3, or 4 at bottom of form
- Graduate Programs staff will not accept a Graduate Student Travel Form without a Travel Authority attached.
- Travel Authority and Graduate Programs Forms with signature(s) and pertinent information should be submitted to Dimetra Harris in CCB 303 for final processing.
Application Rules for $1000 grants
For $1000 grants, GSC will handle the applications. All questions should be directed to gsc-travel@cc.gatech.edu.
$1000 Grant Basic Rules:
- Application periods and bins are set here so that people can be notified if they receive a large grant at least 1 month before their conference (so they can plan to get other funding if they don't get it)
- A GSC sub committee will accept applications, and rank them at the end of an application period and send them to the CoC administrators who will get the final word on who gets the $1000 awards.
- Only 1 $1000 grant can be awarded per area in an academic calendar year for fairness (Areas are HCI, LST, IS, etc)
- $1000 grants are only for PhD students.
- The application periods are:
- For conferences in Sept 1 - Oct 31, applications are accepted from Jun 1 - Jul 31; notification is Aug 3
- For conferences in Nov 1 - Jan 31, applications are accepted from Aug 1 - Sept 30; notification is Oct 3.
- For conferences in Feb 1 - April 30, applications are accepted from Oct 1 - Dec 31; notification is Jan 10
- For conferences in May 1 - June 30, applications are accepted from Jan 1 - Mar 31; notification is April 3.
- For conferences in Jul 1 - Aug 31, applications are accepted from Apr 1 - May 31; notification is Jun 3.
- Students may apply for both the $600 and $1000 grant; however, students who receive a GSC or GPO travel grant are ineligible to receive the other travel grant.
- The GSC subcommittee for Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 is made up by Ceara Byrne (ceara.byrne@gatech.edu) and Ian Stewart (istewart6@gatech.edu).
Applications are evaluated based on these criteria in the order specified:
- Preference will first be given to people without papers (Reason: The GSC created this award primarily for students without support. The assumption is that advisors usually support students who have papers at conferences.)
- Preference given to more senior PhD students
- Preference given to importance of conference to student's research area
- Preference given to students who have not received CoC funding this year
- Only one student per Area can be selected in a calendar year (Areas are HCI, LST, IS, etc)
- Only one $1000 grant is available for each application period
How To Apply:
To apply, the following information should be submitted to gsc-travel@cc.gatech.edu during the appropriate application period.
- Which conference are you applying for? What are the dates of the conference?
- What year are in you in the PhD program?
- What area are you in the PhD program?
- Computational Science and Engineering, Computer Architecture, Database Systems, Graphics and Visualizations, Human-Computer Interaction, Information Security, Intelligent Systems, Learning Sciences and Technology, Machine Learning, Networking and Communications, Programming Languages and Compilers, Social Computing, Software Methodology and Engineering, Systems, Theoretical Computer Science, Other (please specify)

**New Policy** If you are awarded a GSC travel grant and for any reason cannot attend the conference, please notify the GSC travel committee as soon as possible. If you are awarded a travel grant and do not attend the conference, you will be ineligible to apply for the GSC travel grant in the future. Exceptions due to emergencies will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
College of Computing and GT requirements for Travel support
Before any GT travel, if you are granted a full or partial funding award, you must complete a Travel Authority (TA). The Financial Officer in your Area or Administrative point person can assist you with the "TA". Once it is completed, David White must sign it and you will be set to travel.
Once you return from your trip, you will have 15 days to complete a Travel Reimbursement form and submit to your Area Admin. person or Financial Officer with your "original" receipts, etc. to receive your reimbursement.
General GVC Area Questions
Scope
All PhD students in Geometric and Visual Computing (GVC) are expected to know the basic graphic principles and techniques (lightfield, ray-tracing and z-buffer scan-conversion, view control, scene graph computation, rendering pipeline operations) and the basic 2D graphics and 3D modeling terminology (topology, geometry), representation schemes (CSG, BSP, Voxels, octrees, triangle mesh) and techniques (key-frame animation, intersection calculations, convex hulls, marching cubes). They should also be aware of the major issues (geometric complexity, realtime performance, numeric accuracy, sampling artifacts) and research opportunities in the overall GVC area. The following is a list of examples of topics that students should be familiar with:

Sample Questions
- OPEN RESEARCH PROBLEMS: List the 5 most important open problems in the Geometric and Visual Computing area that you expect to be funded and researched actively over the next 10 years. Discuss the motivation and summarize the current state of the art. Explain the research issues and say what makes them hard. How would you attack them if you had to?
- COMPARE REPRESENTATIONS OF SOLIDS: Describe the following five representation schemes for solids: Boundary representation, CSG, BSP, Voxel, Octree. For each, describe in broad terms a typical data-structure and give the details of an efficient algorithm for classifying a point against a solid. Compare these five representations in terms of storage, performance of point-classification, and convenience for interactive design.
- PERFORMANCE ACCELERATION: Discuss the stages and factors that limit the performance of current generation hardware-assisted rendering pipeline architectures. Discuss all the general purpose graphic acceleration techniques that you know. For each, explain in broad terms the principles, fundamental algorithms, data-structures, expected benefits, and limitations.
- IMAGE-BASED RENDERING: Assuming that you can track the head of a visitor in front of a large 2 megapixel screen, you wish to give her the impression that the screen is actually a windowthrough which you can see a beautiful garden (where nothing moves). Explain precisely how you would acquire the necessary data, how you would store it, how much storage would be necessary, how you would render the images in realtime, and how much rendering power you would need.
- MORPHING: Consider two polygonal regions A and B. Describe in details four techniques for animating a morph between them. What does it mean for the morph to be smooth? What does it mean to be minimal? For each one of the techniques you described, discuss their smoothness, minimality, and domain.
- PERSPECTIVE: The perspective transformation used for 3D rendering maps a model point P=(x,y,z) to a point (x',y',z') so that (x',y') are the coordinates of the point where P appears on the screen. Typically, z' is chosen as a monotonic function of z, so as to ensure that depth order is preserved for z-buffer based hidden surface removal. Company X has proposed to set z'=z, normalized so that its range varies between 0 and 2^32-1, and to represent Z' as an integer. Explain why this approach does not work.
- SHADOW: Assume that the light source is the edge (u,v). It is not a point source, nor an area source. The scene comprises only two triangles connected to each other: (a,b,c) and (c,b,d). Both the light source and the triangles are above the floor. Explain very precisely how to compute the exact shadow (umbra) cast by the two triangles on the floor. In particular, provide a formal definition of the shadow and state its properties. Is it connected? Is it convex? Is it polygonal? Note that discrete methods which would use pixels or sample the edge are not appropriate. However, you may assume that geometric tools for generating simple shapes (rays, edge, planes, cones) and for computing their intersections are available.
- REGISTRATION: Consider a viewpoint V and three screen locations (P,Q, and R) through which you see the three vertices (A,B,C) of an equilateral triangle of edge length L. Assume that you are given the 3D locations of V, P, Q, and R. Explain how you would compute a possible location for the vertices (A,B,C).
- SELF-INTERSECTION: A piece of cloth is simulated by a triangle mesh and animated through physical simulation. However, the self-intersection detection algorithm is far too slow. Suggest a good algorithm that would detect self-intersections and explain in detail what it would do and how you would implement it.
- MORPHING: An algorithm that morphs between two convex planar polygons places them into two parallel planes z=0 and z=1, computes their convex hull H and computes the morph at time t between 0 and 1 as the intersection of H and the plane z=t. Assuming that the polygons are represented as circular lists of vertices in counterclockwise order, design a linear-time algorithm for computing H. Propose a way of representing the morph that allows to compute it at time increments using as few expensive arithmetic operations (multiplications, divisions) as possible.
- LIGHT: The intensity of perceived light coming from a point light source decays quadratically with distance. Explain why it is acceptable to assume (as we usually do in Computer Graphics) that the intensity of light preceived along an unobstructed ray remains constant. Discuss situations where this assumption is no longer appropriate. The amount of light emitted in direction V by a point on a smooth Lambertian surface with normal N is proportional to the dot-product of N with L. Explain why the intensity of light reflected by a Lambertian surface appears to be independent of orientation.
- SIMILARITY: You are given a family of similar shapes, for example the 3D models of the femur bone scanned or a large population. You want to compute the average of these shapes. Please discuss several registration and shape averaging approaches and comment of their strength and weaknesses.
- DEPTH: This question is about triangle rendering on a typical commodity PC graphics card. Be careful to notice which stage in rendering each sub-question is asking about.
- For triangles rendered in perspective, what is a typical treatment of the depth coordinate (usually z) by the vertex processor? What information does the vertex processor give to the next stage in the graphics pipeline?
- Describe the task of the triangle rasterization stage in a typical graphics card. Describe in particular how the depth information is treated.
- Describe how the per-fragment depth information is treated at the fragment processor to assure proper hidden surfaces.
- Explain why the particular depth value in (a) and (b) are used, and describe why problems can occur if the "obvious" depth is used.
- GLIDER: We want to roller-blade on an oriented manifold triangle mesh M in 3D. Our feet are never to leave the surface. We want our head to remain vertical with respect to the surface of the mesh at the point of contact. Furthermore, we want to slide at a constant tangential velocity (no acceleration component in a tangential direction with respect to M). Assume that we start at a point P of edge (A,B) and that we just entered triangle T, which has vertices (A,B,C), with an initial velocity vector V that is tangential to T. Please describe in details how you will compute the time t and position P’ when we leave T, and also how to identify the edge through which we exit T. Now, assume that we exit T through edge (B,C) and enter triangle T’ with vertices (C,B,D). Describe in details how to compute our new velocity vector V’ in T’. For simplicity, assume that you never hit a vertex.
- SHADOW: A point light source is located at (0,0,h). The floor is defined by z=0. Provide simple formulae for the coordinates (x’,y’,z’) of the floor-shadow P’ cast by point P=(x,y,z). Now express the transformation that takes P to P’ as the result of a multiplication by a 4x4 matrix (using homogeneous coordinates) followed by a division. Explain how such a formulation can be used for casting shadows of 3D objects, discuss its limitations, and compare it to other approaches for rendering shadows.
- TEXTURE: A small company presented a graphics card which performs texturing as follows. For any textured triangle, it projects it to the screen. For each pixel within the triangle's projection, it linearly interpolates texture coordinates from the projected vertices and uses the interpolated texture coordinates (after proper scaling) to look up the color from the texture. Does this approach work (explain)? If it does not, how can it be fixed?
- PROJECTION: Consider an ideal projector (with a point-sized bulb) that projects qualifier questions onto a screen. We don't assume anything about the orientation of the projector with respect to the screen (which means that the text on the screen will generally appear distorted). You take a picture of the projected text (again, with an ideal pinhole camera) from some (arbitrary) place in front of the screen, then do simple thresholding to extract the text and produce a slide out of your picture. Is it always possible to place the projector (with the new slide in it) so that the text shows up undistorted on the screen? Explain why.
- OCCLUSION: What is the shape of the perspective projection of an unobstructed ball? Justify your answer. Provide the details of a simple geometric calculation that would establish precisely whether a ball of center G and radius r is hidden from a viewpoint V by a triangle having vertices A, B, and C. Use 3D vectors rather than coordinates in the formulation of your solution. Discuss how such a test could be used to accelerate graphics.
- PERSPECTIVE: Consider a perspective transformation T that maps a point P=(x,y,z) to a point P'=dP/(d+z).
- Where are the viewpoint and the near and far clipping planes of the viewing frustum?
- What is the 3D image (result of a mapping by T) of the half-space z>0?
- What are the preimages by T of [0,d/2] and of [d/2,d]?
- What can you conclude? (Suppose for instance that your z-buffer had only one bit per pixel.)
- Prove that T maps planes onto planes.
- Why is this important?
- LIGHTFIELD: Consider a lightfield L of a 3D object S. Let B be the subset of the rays of L that miss S.
- Suggest a mathematical expression of a good approximation A of S in terms of B.
- Can you guarantee that A contains S or is contained in S? Explain.
- Suggest an efficient algorithm for generating a triangle mesh that approximates A.
- COLOR: Discuss which 3D graphic techniques are based on the assumption that the light reflected by a point P on object in direction T remains constant along the ray through P parallel to T, as long as the ray does not intersect an obstacle? Yet, we know that the energy dissipated by a point source diminishes with the square of the distance. So how can that assumption be true? Explain what is going on. Discuss the limitations of that assumption and their implication on the correctness of 3D graphics techniques.
- COLLISION: Briefly describe an algorithm to perform collision detection between N concave 3D objects moving around on a heightfield terrain. What is the O() runtime of this algorithm? Describe 4 general techniques to speed up the operation of this algorithm in practice, and present a brief analysis of where speedup would occur.
- NEIGHBOR: Having a number of sites in the plane, we want to find the one which is the closest (in the Euclidean metric) to a query point.
- Describe a heuristic based on space partitioning to speed up the queries of this kind for a given set of sites.
- Let's say that all the query points and sites live in some rectangle in the plane. How would you use the standard graphics hardware in a simple way to approximately (i.e. with pixel accuracy) answer the nearest neighbor queries?

GT Computing Community
The Office of Outreach, Enrollment, and Community is poised to present another semester of awesome activities and endeavors for the 3,000 plus students that we serve. These programs are designed to complement the academic development that you’ll receive in the classroom. We are better equipped to serve you as we’ve acquired new tools during over COVID 19 experience. It’s also our sincere hope that your respective endeavors have an even bigger impact in the field on computing.
Life at the College of Computing isn’t just academic, professional, or social and Georgia Tech offers a wide variety of ways to get involved and find your path.
The College of Computing faculty and staff will walk with you from the first day of college through your graduation from Georgia Tech. We provide a community-minded atmosphere, where students can step in and out of offices for advice, ask a question, or just to hang out.
Be sure to also follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for more fun content!
YouTube is our main platform to share our resources across the College of Computing community. We post content that we hope you’ll find useful, whether it be a past yoga session, a quarantine edition of healthy eating, or shared experiences by students, for students.
GT Community Resources
Pet Therapy
Pet Therapy
Interacting with dogs is a great way to cope with the stress that comes with being a college student. To give our students and staff a fun way to relax, we bring dogs to the College of Computing twice a semester for people to pet and cuddle. Pet therapy is also great for cardiovascular assistance and has calming effects.
Coaching
Coaching
Leveraging our strengths is something we don’t do enough. Many students deal with imposter syndrome, feelings of doubt and belonging, when they step foot onto Tech’s campus. We work with you to help you take control of your academic, personal, and career path and realize your full potential.
Impact Program
Impact Program
The Impact through Science, Technology, and Social Good or Impact Living-Learning Community (LLC) is a LLC and initiative open to all first-year students who are interested in exploring issues of diversity and social good, community engagement, and sustainability.
GameFest
E-Sports
GameFest is another community-based initiative that’s gaining momentum in the college. We currently sponsor Gamefest LAN competitions twice a year in addition to sponsoring students that participate in competitions outside of the College of Computing.
Please be on the lookout for upcoming announcements as it pertains to GameFest and initiatives!
Resiliency Testimonials
Resiliency Testimonials
Georgia Tech students juggle schoolwork, research, jobs, internship hunting, clubs, sports, and more at the same time. We are a group of students who have a huge work ethic, but sometimes it can be overwhelming. At the end of their four years, students graduate with a diverse and impressive set of experiences that they can pass down to future students. We are interested in creating a collection of resiliency stories that could help others see past the tumulus work of the day or week – that the grass is indeed greener on the other side. If interested, please email Troy Peace at tpeace9@cc.gatech.edu
Self-Care
Self-Care
We are firm believers in taking care of ourselves here in the college. In order for you to begin interacting with others and making a difference, it is imperative that show yourself the attention that you deserve. We host a series of events that promote self-care in Klaus Atrium throughout the year where you can drop in, chat and relax with us, and grabs some snacks for the road!
Nutrition
Nutrition
Nutrition is an essential part of success for every student. Programs exist throughout every semester to give students advice and recommendations on how to eat healthy on a budget. The CoC partners with Health Initiatives at STAMPS to discuss these topics. Whether you are cooking for the first time or are a seasoned chef, there is always something new to learn.
Mental Health and Wellness
Mental Health and Wellness
Mental health is and remains a priority in the College of Computing, especially during this time. We have our in-house counselor Scott LaSalle located on the first floor of the College of Computing building. We also plan workshops and partner with Stamps Health Services to provide a safe space and facilitate the tough conversations around mental health. Finally, we believe that meditation is an excellent way to escape the hectic life of a Tech student. Join us for meditations to reduce stress, control anxiety, and enhance self-awareness
Transfer Chats
Transfer Chats
The transfer chats are a way for new and old transfers to engage with the community staff and other transfers in a way they might not have known. It is easy for many transfer students to miss a lot of the opportunities that are offered to them in the CoC and these discussions help to teach them the serves available as well as for them to get their voices heard by staff and discuss what things they want to see offered in the current semester and beyond.
Community Podcast
Community Podcast
The community podcast is a biweekly discussion with members of the Georgia Tech CoC community where individuals have an opportunity to tell their stories and speak about their experiences at Georgia Tech. Although the format is similar, the responses and stories from each person create a unique and human dialogue that serves to help those who sometimes feel isolated in difficult times.
Yoga
Yoga
College of Computing Yoga is a weekly aspect of the College of Computing Community. Each Friday we gather to unwind and decompress from the week’s activities. Classes are designed to be made for those who have a wide range of skill levels. Whether you have years of experience or no experience the hour-long practice will be time well spent.

GVC Area - Modeling
Geometry processing: design, representation, rendering, analysis, transmission, and animation of shapes
Scope
All GVC students who select Modeling as one of the two specialization sub-areas for the second part of their qualifier are expected to be familiar with the main concepts, major results, common mathematical foundations, and algorithmic techniques used for representing, constructing, processing, transmitting, and rendering digital models of shapes. These include for example the data structure and algorithms for constructing and processing popular representation techniques for curves, surfaces, and solids. Furthermore, students in this area are also expected to understand the various acceleration techniques (simplification, compression, occlusion, space partition) for processing, rendering, animating, or transmitting shapes and basic Computational Geometry results and techniques for dealing efficiently with very large models. Typical problems in Modeling include:
- Interactive design and editing of curves, surfaces, and solids
- Construction of a valid (water-tight, oriented) triangle mesh from a large polygon soup
- Smoothing, sharpening, refining, resampling, and simplifying triangle meshes
- Compression, progressive transmission, and streaming of large triangle meshes
- Level-of-Detail, occlusion culling, streamable meshes, and other acceleration techniques for very large meshes
- Shape analysis, segmentation, matching, comparison, mapping and morphing
- Hardware-assist for collision detection, Boolean operations

- DIFFERENCE AND DISTANCE BETWEEN POLYHEDRA: Let A and B be two sets. Provide precise definitions for the minimum distance between them, for the Hausdorff distance between them, and for the volume of their symmetric difference. Illustrate the differences between these measures on 2D examples. Especially show examples of drastically different sets with a small Hausdorff distance and a large difference and also of sets with a small volume difference and a large Hausdorff distance. Provide efficient algorithms for computing them when A and B are two convex polyhedra, each represented by a triangle mesh.
- SUBDIVISION SURFACES: Define what are subdivision surfaces. Describe in details two subdivision schemes for triangle meshes. Discuss their drawbacks. How would you convert a manifold triangulated surface into an approximating subdivision surface. How could you use such a multi-resolution model to edit large features of a 3D shape while preserving small details.

- MORPHOLOGY: Mathematical morphology is an elegant way to cast the problem of representing shape in a set-theoretical framework. Describe its basic concepts and operations (closing, opening, erosion, dilation, structuring elements, etc.) Illustrate them on 2D examples.
- SIMPLIFICATION: A long-standing problem concerns the reduction in the number of polygons to reduce overall model complexity. Describe some of the well known methods to accomplish this, contrasting their respective advantages and disadvantages.
- CURVES AND SURFACES: What is a B-spline curve? How do you subdivide a control polyline in 3D so that in the limit you obtain a cubic Bspline? How do you convert a control polyline of a cubic Bspline curve into a series of Bezier control polygons that represent segments of the original Bspline curve.
- PRIMITIVE SHAPES. Formulate the parametric and implicit representations for a circular cone and a torus. Explain how these should be used for testing point-containment and for computing intersections with rays and the normal at these intersections.
- DIGITIZATION: It is often desirable to digitize a 3D object and then create a model of the object for subsequent analysis or visualization. A number of 3D digitization approaches exist: Describe these, pointing out their relative advantages/disadvantages, and discuss how a surface representation (either polygonal or parametric, for instance) can be built up from the collected data.
- DELAUNAY AND VORONOI: Explain what is a Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in the plane and what is their Voronoi diagram. Describe precisely the relation between these two and how one may be derived from the other. Provide a simple yet reasonably efficient algorithm for computing the Voronoi diagram of V points in 2D. What is the asymptotic complexity of this algorithm?
- PLAN PARTITION: The difference between a plane P and the union of L lines in P in general position is a set of R maximally connected regions. Define the properties of these regions and express L precisely as a function of R (prove your formula). Each region may be identified by L bits. Each bit indicating whether the region lies on the left or on the right of the corresponding line. How many possible regions could be defined by all the combinations of values for these bits? Provide an efficient algorithm that would discover which of these combinations correspond to non empty regions. What is the complexity of this algorithm?
- ALPHA-SHAPES: Given a set of P points in the plane, describe in details an algorithm that would interpolate these points by a well chosen set of triangles and lines.

- NUMERIC ACCURACY: Explain why integers are more effective than floats for representing the coordinates of the vertices of a polyhedral 3D model. Outline a process of computing the most accurate k-bit integer representation for each vertex coordinate. What should be the minimum k for locating cities on a map of the US? What should be k for modeling a car engine with 1mm accuracy? Explain why fixed precision computations may lead to drastic errors in the computation of the intersection between two polyhedra. Discuss epsilon-based and exact techniques to overcome this problem.
- MINKOWSKI OPERATIONS: Define the Minkowski sum between two sets and illustrate it in 2D. Provide a simple and efficient algorithm for computing it for two convex polygons in 2D.

-
CONSTRICTION: You are given a manifold triangle mesh M in 3D that has two bounding loops, A and B, where the vertices are arranged along a regular circle of radius r. M is represented using the Corner Table or some equivalent data structure, so that you can use corner operators: c.v, c.t, c.n, c.s. M is an irregular triangulation of a long, winding tube. Explain how you would compute the key constriction: the place where the area of the cross-section of the tube passes by a global minimum. The problem is that the term ‘constriction’ is not well defined. Please do your best to define it.
-
STEADY PATTERN: You are given two edges E(A0,B0) and E(An,Bn) in 3D. Explain how you would compute a steady pattern of n-1 intermediate edges that starts with edge E(A0,B0) and finishes with edge E(An,Bn). (A pattern is steady if there exists a transformation T such that E(Ai+1,Bi+1) = T(E(Ai,Bi)). Explain your overall approach and provide some guidance (not necessarily all the details) about how to compute it. Is the motion we define unique?
-
ROOMS: M is a triangle mesh with T triangles, E edges, and V vertices. M is connected. Each edge bounds at least 2 triangles. No vertex is a junction (i.e., removing any single vertex will not change the genus or number of components). M (i.e., the closure of the union of its triangles) decomposes three-space into a set of rooms (connected components of the complement of M), including one external, infinite room. Provide an outline and enough details to guide an implementation of an algorithm that computes the number n of rooms. Explain what data structure and operators you would like to have to support your algorithm.
-
BENT CAPLET: Consider three disjoint balls with centers A, B, C and with respective radii a, b, c. Explain how they may be used to define a bent caplet: A solid bounded by a smooth surface that contains a portion of Sph(A,a) and Sph(C,c) and is hugging (tangential contact) Sph(B,b) along the way. Provide first a high-level outline and then enough detail to guide an implementation of an algorithm that would render the bent caplet. Explain why the solution of using Neville’s algorithm in 4 space (3 coordinates and radius) may fail to produce a smooth surface and how your solution fixes the problem.

Janet L. Kolodner – Interactive Computing Regents’ Professor Emeritus, cognitive learning
Regents’ Professor Emerita Janet L. Kolodner joined GA Tech’s School of Information and Computer Science (ICS) in December 1980, and retired from the School of Interactive Computing in August 2014, with almost 34 years of service. She is a Fellow of the Association for Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and an Inaugural Fellow of the International Society for the Learning Sciences. She was founding Director of Georgia Tech's EduTech Institute; founding Editor in Chief of The Journal of the Learning Sciences and Editor-in-Chief Emeritus; and a founder of the International Society for the Learning Sciences (ISLS) and its first Executive Officer. From 2010-2014, she was a program officer at the US National Science Foundation and led efforts to establish and sustain the Cyberlearning Program.
Janet's research has addressed a wide variety of issues in learning, memory, and problem solving, both in computers and in people. During the 1980s, she and her students pioneered the computer method called case-based reasoning (CBR), which allows a computer to reason and learn from its experiences. The first case-based design aids (CBDA'S) came from her lab. Archie-2, for example, helped architecture students with conceptual design. During the early 1990s, she and her students used the cognitive model implied by case-based reasoning to address issues in creative design. JULIA planned meals, Creative JULIA figured out what to do with leftover rice, and ALEC simulated Alexander Graham Bell in his invention of the telephone. During the 1990s, she also became a designer of middle school science curriculum and learning technologies informed by CBR’s cognitive model. The approach, developed in collaboration with a wide variety of post-doctoral fellows and research scientists, called Learning by Design (LBD), is design-driven, inquiry-oriented, and project-based; children learn science in the context of design experiences. The sequencing of activities encourages students to reflect on their experiences in ways that CBR says are appropriate for productively integrating what they are learning into memory. LBD curriculum units and the sequencing structures from LBD are integrated into a published 3-year middle-school science curriculum called Project-Based Inquiry Science (PBIS).
In later work, Janet and her students investigated how to help pre-teens and young teens consider who they are as thinkers and come to value informed decision making and informed production and consumption of evidence in the context of design-based learning activities. In Kitchen Science Investigators, 5th and 6th graders came to think about themselves as scientific reasoners and kitchen scientists in the context of cooking and baking. In Hovering Around, they did so in the context of designing hovercraft. Those investigations and a recent investigation of the use of Harvard’s EcoMUVE in middle-school classrooms are leading to suggestions about how to design project challenges and virtual worlds that support their achievement so that they afford deep learning, motivate and sustain engagement over time, and foster student identities as accomplished and comfortable scientific thinkers and problem solvers.
Since September 2017, Janet has been a half-time faculty member in the Lynch School of Education and Human Development at Boston College. She has been designing an MA Program in Learning Engineering, the design of effective and engaging learning experiences. It will educate the next generation of applied learning scientists who will, she hopes, help to make our formal and informal educational spaces places of joyful learning. The first cohort of students will join the program in Fall Semester, 2019.

Class Zero
Dorothy Murray Crosland - Founder of Information Science at Georgia Tech
Crosland was born on Sept. 13, 1903, in Stone Mountain, Georgia, the daughter of Robert and Lena Jones Murray. She graduated from Girls’ High School in Atlanta in 1920 and earned her library degree in 1923 from the Library School of the Carnegie Library of Atlanta (later Emory University School of Library Science). After completing her education, she worked as an assistant cataloger and branch librarian at the Carnegie Library (now Atlanta- Fulton Public Library). In 1925, she became assistant librarian at the Georgia Institute of Technology, serving as acting librarian during Frances Newman’s leaves of absence. She was appointed librarian in 1927, a position she held until 1953 when her title was changed to director of libraries. She retired from Georgia Tech in 1971.
Crosland belonged to numerous professional organizations and received many honors. In 1945, she was named Atlanta’s Woman of the Year in Education, and in 1969, was named Woman of the Year in Professions. Georgia Tech made her an honorary alumna in 1961, and in 1962, the library staff association and friends presented an oil portrait of Crosland to the library. The governor proclaimed April 13, 1971, as Dorothy M. Crosland Day.
Crosland was instrumental in the founding of a graduate program in information science in 1963, which evolved into the College of Computing. She also played a key role in securing the admission of women to Georgia Tech.
At President Blake Van Leer’s request, she surveyed colleges and universities to determine which offered engineering and architecture degrees to women.
Discovering that Georgia was the only state that did not have a private or public engineering or architecture school for women, she wrote a persuasive letter to Rutherford Ellis, Education Committee chair for the Board of Regents, urging them to permit women to attend Tech. As a result, Georgia Tech admitted its first women students. Crosland also became responsible for furnishing and decorating the women’s dorm, then a house on Fifth Street.
Peter A. Freeman - Founding Dean and Professor Emeritus
Freeman was the Founding Dean of the College of Computing in 1990 and served as the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing until 2002. From 2002 to 2007, he was Assistant Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), heading the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate. He previously held positions at George Mason University, Johns Hopkins University, the University of California at Irvine, and Carnegie-Mellon.
At Georgia Tech, he began with a college of about 30 faculty, annual research of less than $2 million, and a few hundred students. Freeman transformed the college into a dynamic group of 65 faculty, annual research well in excess of $10 million, and almost 2,000 students. During Freeman’s tenure, several of the research groups in the College became acknowledged national leaders in fields ranging from theory to Human- Computing Interaction.
As an assistant director of NSF, Freeman helped formulate national science policy., He was also responsible for a number of activities that continue to have major impacts on computing, including the Information Technology Research Program, cyberinfrastructure initiatives, the GENI Internet Research project, Broadening Participation in Computing, and the Computing Community Consortium.

B.S. 1959 – Industrial Management - Imlay had many talents and many passions. Born in Jacksonville, Florida, and raised in Savannah, Georgia, Imlay moved to Atlanta in 1954 to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology and never looked back. His love of Atlanta influenced his career in software, his angel investing, his philanthropy, his friends, and his family.
Following early years at Honeywell and Univac, in 1970 Imlay took a bankrupt company, Management Science America (MSA), and built it into one of the nation’s most successful software companies. MSA also became an incubator for technology executives whom Imlay mentored as they made their own way, spawning some 100 new companies.
MSA went into the public market in 1981 and in 1990, Imlay sold MSA to Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. To further mentor the burgeoning technology community in Atlanta, Imlay established Imlay Investments, Inc. Over the next 20 years, he worked with more than 120 technology companies as an angel investor.
In 1990, he established The Imlay Foundation, Inc., which continues to be a mainstay of philanthropy in Atlanta and Scotland, with an added emphasis on fostering small, entrepreneurial nonprofits, reflecting his business career.
Imlay was an avid golfer and sports fan, purchasing an interest in the Atlanta Falcons in 1991. He also helped build the legacy of his hero, Bobby Jones, through the support of the Bobby Jones Scholars, the Bobby Jones Ethics Program at Emory University, founding Friends of Bobby Jones, sponsoring The Art of Golf exhibit at The High Museum, and countless speaking engagements on his favorite subject – Bobby Jones.
As a golfer, Imlay was a member of seven golf clubs in Atlanta and Scotland. his love of Scotland was anchored in Westerdunes, the home he and his wife, Mary Ellen, restored and enjoyed in North Berwick for more than 25 years. The Imlays hosted hundreds of their favorite people in their Scottish home.

Klaus is also a member of the College of Computing’s Advisory Board.
HCI area - Design
Design lies between the modeling and evaluation needed to determine the needs of an interface and whether the interface meets those needs. It lies conceptually above the interface software and technology. Design is where you choose the kinds of interface software and technologies that are needed for users and shape it in the way that is coherent, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing.
We distinguish between two kinds of HCI knowledge with respect to HCI: Design process and design product. Design process is how you go about arriving at an interface design. Design product is about the elements in that interface design, such as metaphor, optional support for novices, direct manipulation vs. text commands, and so on.
Design Process
Design process focuses on how one comes to make design decisions. A couple of the most common processes are Ethnographic and Scandinavian. Both are about coming to really understand how the users work. Ethnographic is about involving the designer in the community to understand it. Scandinavian is about involving the actual users in the design process. Students should know about these processes and how they are actually used. Just using a good design process doesn't guarantee a good design, of course -- and some very fine designs didn't use either of these processes! A good design process keeps in mind the challenges of designing for users' constraints. The papers by Markus, Suchman, and Nardi, in particular, highlight some of the general issues of design process. The books by Beyer and Holtzblatt and by Nielsen point out whole processes for designing HCI. You'll note a good bit of redundancy between this list and those in the Modeling and Evaluation section. That's on purpose. It's not clear where the line is between understanding the user in order to model her and understanding the user in order to design something for her.

Design Product
Design product is about what you actually put into the interface. The issues here have two levels:
- How you make the gross-level choices that you make. There is clearly an interaction between the interface and the task analyses that one does during modelling, e.g., direct manipulation or command-line?
- How you make the fine-grained choices that you make. Do you use a "desktop metaphor"? If not, what kinds of metaphors do you use?
Students are expected to be able to discuss issues of design with respect to the modeling process. Students should be able to talk about the kinds of tradeoffs that one might make in an interface design and why.
One of the best papers on the topic is the Gentner and Nielsen piece "The Anti-Mac Interface" (citation below). The authors describe the Mac interface in terms of the design decisions made, and then point out that completely reversing each of these design decisions also defines a reasonable and coherent interface but for a different set of users and tasks.
A classic book on the topic is Designing Interaction edited by John Carroll (1991, Cambridge University Press). The chapters on "Cognitive Artifacts" by Don Norman, "The Task-Artifact Cycle" by Caroll, Kellogg, and Rosson, "Interface Problems and Interface Resources" by Stephen Payne are particularly good for highlighting design issues at the level we're describing here.

HCI area - Quantitative and Qualitative Modeling and Evaluation
Introduction
Two activities go hand-in-hand in a majority of HCI research: modeling and evaluation. Modeling addresses what you know about the user, and often their surrounding social and physical environment. A variety of existing models, such as the Human-Model Processor, and modeling techniques, such as Contextual Inquiry, address differing domains and levels of specificity. Models may be used to predict performance, organize field data, and describe potential interactions with a computer interface. As you read, examine the various models and modeling techniques that provide the foundation for the research. When will these models be useful in other research settings? What do you need to know to complete a model? How can you gather that information?
One use of models is to inform the evaluation of an interface. These activities are linked as the specificity and domain of the models constrains the questions that can be addressed in an evaluation. You will notice that specific, quantitative models are used to inform specific, quantitative evaluations. Likewise, more general, qualitative models are often the basis for various qualitative studies. The feasibility of combining various evaluation techniques is influenced by the compatibility of the underlying models. If the models make conflicting assumptions about the user, perhaps even disagreeing on what can or cannot be known, then the validity of combining evaluation techniques is in question.
One of the distinguishing characteristics of the HCI area in Computer Science is the importance of evaluation of how any computer-assisted system impacts its intended user population. Evaluation in HCI (and other human-centered disciplines) is quite different from evaluation in other areas of Computer Science, mainly because it is sometimes hard to construct experiments or observations that give definitive quantitative answers regarding the merit of one system over another. Instead, evaluation in HCI consists of demonstrating a scientific approach to answer questions about a systems relative merit in its context of use. This approach can consist of a myriad of techniques. Sometimes, a very reliable quantitative result is derivable, as is the case in narrowly-focused human motor observations such as a Fitts' Law experiment or a Keystroke-Level Model analysis. Other times, when the impact on work practices is sought, it is nearly impossible to control all influences in a natural setting. A student of HCI should become familiar with the variety of evaluation techniques and develop a sense of suitability of these techniques.
One of the best ways to achieve the ability to critique evaluation approaches is to read examples of evaluation work in the literature. As you read, critique the research based on the repeatability of the experimentation (Could a competent researcher reproduce the findings following the procedures described by the authors?) and the strength of the analysis and conclusions (Did the authors do enough to convince you of their evaluation results?) This is a particularly good way to assess quantitative results, and although this criteria can be used in the assessment of qualitative research, another useful criteria is to ask about the depth of explanation of the particular phenomena being reported.
One way to organize the information that you gather is to fill in the simple, 2x2 matrix:
|Modeling||Evaluation|
|Quantitative|
|Qualitative|
You should pay attention to the horizontal connections between modeling and evaluation techniques. Likewise, notice the connections and disconnections between quantitative qualitative techniques.
General Resources
Surveys and detailed coverage of many modeling and evaluation techniques are covered in CS 6750: Introduction to HCI. Follow on courses such as CS 6455: User Interface Design and Evaluation address Qualitative Methods, while courses such as PSYC 6018 Principles of Research Design and PSYC 7101 Engineering Psychology I: Methods address Quantitative Methods. Being familiar with both, as well as being able to pick which methods are suitable for your own research is an essential skill for an HCI researcher.
Many papers in the SIGCH conference series on Human Factors in Computing Systems, also known as the CHI conference, include significant modeling and evaluation work, both quantitative and qualitative. This is also true of the CSCW conference series (both the ACM CSCW conference and the European ECSCW series), though CSCW research tends to include more qualitative modeling and evaluation. The ACM UIST conference usually does not emphasize modeling and evaluation as much, but there are occasional stellar papers that provide a judicious balance between technology development and evaluation.
Modeling
Fitts' Law, Model-Human Processor and GOMS
Many quantitative models arise from the Human Factors literature. Some models are best suited for describing expert (decision-free), simple motor and cognitive activities. The most well-known examples are Fitts' Law and GOMS. There have been numerous examinations of Fitts' Law in the context of graphical user interface design. Bill Buxton has published several papers on applications and extensions of Fitts' Law. A good example is:
- I. Scott MacKenzie, William Buxton. (1992) Extending Fitts' Law to Two-Dimensional Tasks. Proceedings of ACM CHI'92 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems pp. 219-226.
GOMS is based on a well-known model of human cognition and behavior, the Model-Human Processor. The following paper describes this model as well as the Keystroke Level Model, first defined by Card, Moran and Newell:
- Card, S.K., Moran, T.P and Newell, A. The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction, Lawrence Erlbaum, 1983.
This work is the foundation for the GOMS family of evaluation techniques. GOMS has been one of the few widely known theoretical concepts in human-computer interaction. Two recent and good survey articles on the history and applications of GOMS are:
- Bonnie E. John and David E. Kieras. (1996) Using GOMS for User Interface Design and Evaluation: Which Technique? ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, v.3 n.4 p.287-319.
- Bonnie E. John and David E. Kieras. (1996) The GOMS Family of User Interface Analysis Techniques: Comparison and Contrast. Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction v.3 n.4 p.320-351.
Other Theories of Human Cognition
Other theories of human cognition examine the relationship between information in the head, such as a plan, and information in the world, such as a written to-do list. These theories may be the basis for both qualitative and quantitative models and evaluation techniques. Three contrasting theories are: situated activity, activity theory, and distributed cognition:
- Suchman, L. A. (1987). Plans and Situated Actions: The problem of human-machine communication. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. (Also see http://jupiter.informatik.umu.se/~mjson/hcipd/suchman.html) Also available as (2006) Human-Machine Reconfigurations: Plans and Situated Actions 2nd edition.
- Nardi, B. (1996) Activity theory and HCI & Studying Context. In Bonnie Nardi (Ed). Context and Consciousness: Activity theory and human computer interaction. Cambridge: MIT press.
- Hutchins, E. (1995). Cognition in the Wild. MIT Press. (Also see http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/yvonner/dcog.html)
- Halverson, C. (2002), Activity Theory and Distributed Cognition or What Does CSCW Need to Do With Theories?, Journal of CSCW.
Interaction Models
Some useful models explicitly place the user interacting with a computer interface. These models can be used to compare different interface designs. See:
- Hutchins, Hollan, and Norman (1986) Direct Manipulation Interfaces, in Donald Norman and Stephen Draper, User Centered System Design, 1986, pp. 87-124.
- Michel Beaudouin-Lafon (2000) Instrumental interaction: an interaction model for designing post-WIMP user interfaces, Proceedings of CHI'2000, pages 446-453.
Contextual Inquiry and Design
Contextual Inquiry is a set of methods for gathering qualitative information and human activity in a complex, social setting. A variety of models are used to represent these multivariate environments. Contextual Design is a methodology for using these models to inform an interface design.
- Beyer, H & Holtzblatt, K. (1998) Contextual design: Defining customer-centered systems. San Francisco: Morgan Kaufmann.
Gathering Qualitative Data
A common method for gathering qualitative data is interviewing. This short book is an indispensable guide:
- Interviewing as Qualitative Research, by I.E. Seidman
Two texts that cover the collection and analysis of Qualitative data are:
- Analysing Social Settings by Lofland and Lofland
- Strauss A, Corbin J. Basics of Qualitative Research: Grounded Theory Procedures and Techniques now in 3rd edition.
Many researchers now promote using ethnographic techniques to gather data about complex, social settings. As an example, see:
- Hughes, Sommerville, Bentley & Randall. (1993) Designing with ethnography: Making work visible. Interacting with computers. Vol 5:2. Pp. 239-253.
Evaluation
Quantitative vs. Qualitative
The most basic distinction is between a quantitative or qualitative evaluation. In a quantitative evaluation, the purpose is to come up with some objective metric of human performance that can be used to compare interaction phenomena. This can be contrasted with a qualitative evaluation, in which the purpose is to derive deeper understanding of the human interaction experience. A typical example of a quantitative evaluation is the empirical user study, a controlled experiment in which some hypothesis about interaction is tested through direct measurement. A typical example of a qualitative evaluation is an open-ended interview with relevant users. Some resources:
- See Saul Greenberg's discussion of techniques.
Evaluation Techniques
There are a number of established evaluation techniques that are useful in different situations. When reading about these techniques, focus on understanding when a technique is valid, and the underlying model of human behavior.
Cognitive Walkthrough
The cognitive walkthrough technique is another example of a theory-based evaluation technique.
- Peter Polson, Clayton Lewis, John Rieman, Cathleen Wharton, (1992) Cognitive Walkthroughs: A Method for Theory-Based Evaluation of User Interfaces. International Journal of Man-Machine Studies v.36 n.5 p.741-773.
Discount usability
In contrast to the theory-based techniques, there are a range of evaluation techniques that are more practically based, relying less on a foundational theory of human performance or cognition. Two good examples of this class of evaluation techniques are questionnaires and heuristic evaluation.
Summative vs. Formative
An important question to ask when performing evaluation is when to perform the evaluation with respect to the overall life cycle of a system. Formative evaluation occurs prior to much investment in implementation of a design, whereas summative evaluation occurs after a full system has been deployed. Many evaluation techniques can be employed in either a formative or summative mode, but it is important to know what the difference is when applied before or after an artifact has been implemented. You must also take into account the co-evolutionary influence of human tasks and interaction technology.
What is enough evaluation?
It is also important to understand that within the HCI research community, there are different expectations for evaluation. We should not expect the same amount of evaluation efforts in a paper that talks about a toolkit supporting multimodal gesture recognition as we would in a paper concerned with the impact of some existing technology in a domestic environment. When reading a research paper in the HCI area, you need to determine what the appropriate expectations should be for user-centered evaluation and judge accordingly. Remember that all systems have users (a programmer uses a toolkit) and proper consideration for the needs of that user should always be apparent in HCI research.
HCI Special Topics - Information Visualization
Introduction
We are in an era of measurement, where sensors of all forms continuously capture phenomena and store them in data. While one would hope that the wealth of data would be an asset, too often the reverse is true: the volume of data simply serves to confuse and paralyze a person in a decision-making process. How do we build technology to help people make sense of their data, empowering them with insights to make decisions, produce scientific discoveries, and increase their understanding of the data-rich world we live in?
The field of Information visualization is the study of how people use symbols, images, graphics, and interfaces to help examine, analyze, and understand data and information. Here, the term "information" generally means abstract data that has no physical correspondence, such as baseball statistics, large text corpuses, customer purchase databases, telephone calling patterns, and so on. Understanding information visualization requires a person to learn about basic multivariate data characterizations, visual properties such as color and animation, general visualization techniques, and existing information visualization tools and systems.
The literature in this area selects readings from topics including: understanding of how to bind data attributes and values to visual encodings and visual metaphors, evaluating the effectiveness of a visualization to generate insights for users, leveraging toolkits and frameworks to create visualizations, and understanding the value that visualizations have in helping humans think about (and analyze) their data.
Most importantly, students seeking an in-depth understanding of the area should take the course, CS 7450 - Information Visualization.

HCI Special Topics - Ubiquitous Computing
Introduction
In a seminal 1991 Scientific American article, Mark Weiser commented that all profound technologies eventually vanish, meaning they become so commonplace in our everyday experience that we take them for granted. Weiser coined the phrase ubiquitous computing and lead a project at Xerox PARC bearing the same name. Over a decade later, ubiquitous computing, and related fields such as wearable computing and augmented reality, has become one of the major emerging themes in HCI research.
General Resources
Students of the area should read the following two seminal papers by Weiser:
- Mark Weiser. (1991) The Computer for the 21st Century, Scientific American, September, pp. 94-104.
- Mark Weiser. (1993) Some computer science issues in ubiquitous computing. Communications of the ACM, 36(7):75-84, July.
Initial papers in ubiquitous computing appeared in distributed computing and operating systems workshops and conferences, but starting in 1992, and increasingly in the late 1990's, a number of papers on novel technology (such as the Liveboard) and applications (such as Tivoli) appeared in HCI-relevant conferences such as CHI and UIST. In other conferences, such as MobiCom or Multimedia (ACM or IEEE), you will find some ubiquitous computing papers that focus mainly on applications level research. A good review of ubiquitous computing research over the decade of the 1990's and looking forward to the first decade of the 21st century is:
- Gregory D. Abowd and Elizabeth D. Mynatt. (2000) ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, special issue on HCI in the new Millenium, 7(1):29-58, August. PDF available on-line.
A number of relevant conferences have sprung up since the late 1990s, including:
- International Symposium on Wearable Computing (ISWC, since 1997)
- DARE (augmented reality, since 2000)
- Handheld and Ubiquitous Computing (HUC, since 1999)
Serious students of the subject should consider taking CS 7470: Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing. In addition, several advanced topics on novel interaction technologies (pen-based computing, recognition technologies) are briefly surveyed in CS 6456: Principles of User Interface Software. The Systems area course, CS 7210: Distributed Computing covers fundamental research issues in distributed computing, much of which is relevant in the construction of ubiquitous computing systems.
Technologies for Ubicomp
The following topics cover the wide variety of technological themes of ubiquitous computing research.
- handheld and wearable computing and other small form factor portable computing
- environmental computing, or instrumentation of the physical environment through tangible interaction techniques and embedded computing
- "off the desktop" interaction technology, such as pen, voice, gesture and sensing
- multimedia and multimodal interaction
- novel display technology for small and large form factors
Academic publications are not necessarily the best place to look for current information on emerging technologies relevant for ubiquitous computing. It is a good idea to keep informed of emerging technologies through familiarity with on-line trade publications, such as the Personal Technology Section on CNET. Other good sources are Ziff Davis and Wired News.
Application Themes
As Weiser pointed out, the whole purpose of ubiquitous computing is to create applications for humans. Several major applications themes have emerged in the first decade of ubicomp research, and students should familiarize themselves with canonical examples of these research areas, (reviewed in detail in the Abowd and Mynatt articled cited above):
- Context-Aware Computing. A major theme in HUC proceedings and ISWC as well. This theme ranges from novel applications of sensing to support useful application behavior to generalized support for the design and implementation of context-aware applications.
- Automated capture environments, starting from the initial Tivoli work at PARC. An important local example of this domain is the Classroom 2000 / eClass project, looking at capture in an educational setting.
- Natural interaction, as is provided through the use of recognition technologies.
Evaluation and Social issues
Grudin points out some of the challenges with evaluating groupware systems (see the CSCW summary in this body of knowlege). Many of these same challenges apply to ubicomp applications. In addition, pervasive computing technologies bring additional challenges to the researcher to prototype and understand the social implications of sometimes invasive techniques. A good handle of the classic HCI evaluation techniques and the qualitative techniques learned in CS 6455: User Interface Design and Evaluation, will lead the inquisitive student towards a better understanding of how to do proper and socially relevant HCI research in ubiquitous computing.

ML@GT Announces First Ph.D. Fellowship Program
Beginning in January 2020, the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) will be supporting select Ph.D. students through a new ML@GT Fellows Program. Created with the intent to foster novel Ph.D. research in machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI), the program expands Georgia Tech’s rapidly growing presence in the field.
“ML and AI is an increasingly important field in all aspects of life. As a center that works to train the next generation of leaders in socially and ethically responsible ways, we hope that this program will allow more students who are interested in the field to pursue their education,” said ML@GT Director Irfan Essa.
The center anticipates selecting four students who will receive roughly half of a graduate research assistant (GRA) appointment. While ML is a collaborative field with many subfields, the focus of projects must be on advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence methods that enable applications rather than creating the applications themselves.
The program is open to any Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who has a mentor or advisor that is affiliated with the center. Preference will also be given to students who are not already supported by a fellowship.
Applications for the fellowship are due on Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019 at 12 p.m. with award notices being sent by early January 2020.
Visit the application portal for more information and to apply.

Krishna Tapped as Deputy Director for $5.5 Million Department of Energy Artificial Intelligence Initiative
The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has given three institutions a $5.5 million grant to collectively find solutions to some of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence (AI) today. Scientists from Georgia Tech, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratory will collaborate to develop technologies that are core to the DOE’s priorities including cybersecurity, graph analytics, and electric grid resilience.
Tushar Krishna, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Machine Learning Center (ML@GT), will serve as a deputy director of the newly established Center for Artificial Intelligence-focused Architectures and Algorithms (ARIAA).
Georgia Tech is contributing expertise in modeling and developing custom accelerators for machine learning and sparse linear algebra. The institute will also provide access to its advanced computing resources.
“Georgia Tech provides a great environment to carry out this research, because of vibrant research centers such as ML@GT and CRNCH that bring together researchers from algorithms, compilers, architecture, circuits, and novel devices fostering collaboration and innovation,” says Krishna.
Centered around “co-design”, ARIAA is designed to help researchers strike the right balance between the capabilities of hardware and software. Finding the perfect balance allows researchers to corral the vastly different algorithms and architectures available that could best solve a given problem. While co-design is not new, the increasing popularity of AI has drawn it back into focus.
Another difficult challenge that continues to face researchers is how to best design supercomputers to that they are beneficial to the DOE in solving the nation’s most difficult problems in engineering, health, energy, and science. The project will aim to develop algorithms and architectures that can be applied to current and future systems.
The grant announcement reinforces the DOE’s commitment to accelerating the development, delivery, research, and adoption of AI, and supports President Trump’s plans for a national strategy to design AI technologies that are developed to positively impact American lives.
Hiring Guidelines
The College of Computing recognizes that students need time to make informed decisions when evaluating and responding to offers. We also recognize that employers need to effectively manage their time-sensitive recruitment processes. The following guidelines are intended to help both students and employers manage the offer process in a fair and transparent framework. We have created these guidelines to help minimize reneges, reduce the pressure put on our students, and align with the GT campus.
"Experience shows the best employment decisions for both students and employers are those that are made without pressure and with the greatest amount of information and transparency. Students are given sufficient time to attend career fairs, participate in on-campus interviews, and/or complete the interviewing in which they are currently engaged are more likely to make good long-term employment decisions and may be less likely to renege on job acceptances."
- NACE Advisory Opinion: Setting Reasonable Deadlines for Job Offers
2020-2021 Timeline
Deadline for Offers: Summer conversion offers are full-time offers made to an intern or co-op student for an opportunity beginning after graduation. Fall offers refer to full-time, internship, or co-op offers made to students during the Fall recruiting season.

Impact Living Learning Community
The Impact Program is a relatively new aspect of the Community Services offered in the College of Computing. We’ve enhanced our services by creating cohorts for students that often find themselves without a network. Students often need someone to talk to. You need to know where to go in and outside of campus. They also need safe and convenient ways of getting there. They need a familiar face or faces that take the same classes and are experiencing the same issues. Sometimes there’s also a voice that they need to hear that connects them to teaching assistants, professors, or tutors. That voice also can also “suggest” calling home to mom or dad if there’s a need. I serve as that voice for many students in the College of Computing.
Questions:
If you have any questions or concerns as it relates to College of Computing Community Community events and programs or the Impact Living Learning Community please contact Director of the Computing Community Troy Peace at tpeace@cc.gatech.edu

Interaction
|
||
||
||
||
||
|
|User interaction in visualization lets people ask questions of their data, change representations to see alternative views, and perform other data-centric and visualization-centric operations to explore their data and gain insight. The papers below describe the different types of interactions that can be found in visualizations and the different ways that interaction and cognition go hand-in-hand. Finally, the third paper explores interaction beyond traditional desktop WIMP styles.

About Barcelona
Located on the Mediterranean Sea and offering a vibrant cosmopolitan atmosphere, Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, a unique region of Spain. Known for its cultural and artistic heritage, Catalonia’s contribution to 20th century art includes the architect Gaudí and painters such as Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí. Catalonia is a world-recognized model for blending art, culture, urban planning, and industry; the region combines a rich mixture of high-tech industries, culture, medical centers, and institutions of higher learning (numerous U.S. companies have a strong presence in Catalonia, and there are several colleges and universities serving the area). Both a major attraction and economically important aspect of Catalonia is its Mediterranean cuisine and its production of wines (such as Freixenet and Codorníu).
Barcelona was founded in the third century and has been ruled by Romans, Visigoths, Moors, and Franks over the centuries. The influences of these periods are still visible throughout the city. Since the Middle Ages, Barcelona has been a major port and commercial center, and is Spain's second largest city and a major industrial center.
Bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Pyrenees Mountains, Barcelona offers contrasting sights and experiences throughout the seasons and within relatively short distances. With the Costa Brava to the north and the Costa Dorada to the south, beautiful beaches surround this port city. Barcelona is close to Andorra and France, and also to the Balearic Islands (including its most famous island, Ibiza). There is an excellent, clean, and inexpensive network of bus, metro, and railroad services serving inner areas of Barcelona, as well as connecting the city to the region and the rest of Europe. In addition, a number of discount airlines flying into Barcelona (BCN) and the nearby Girona airport (GRO) render travel to destinations throughout Europe both inexpensive and flexible.
The people of Barcelona speak Catalan and Spanish, and many are fluent in French. Many Catalans speak English, as it is now required in public middle schools, and it is common to see signs in English and German, especially during the height of the summer tourist season. You need not speak Catalan or Spanish to fully enjoy Barcelona!
Barcelona is a city full of tree-lined boulevards, open spaces, and architectural diversity. Large public sculptures abound throughout the city, and the people of Barcelona (as do most Spaniards) take to these public parks and boulevards for their daily afternoon stroll (paseo). The city has preserved numerous historic places and combined them with the very modern. As host of the 1992 Summer Olympics, a number of new structures have emerged, with some areas within the city literally added by extending the land toward the sea. Perhaps the most striking aspect of Barcelona is the cultural pace of the city: each week, there are countless fairs, expositions, exhibits, performances, and artistic events from which to choose. Moreover, Barcelona has an amazing diversity of restaurants and cafes offering superb culinary experiences as well as informal, low-cost meals. And of course, there are the beaches. It is no wonder that Barcelona is a major tourist center and an increasingly active port of call for cruise ships. One of the most noteworthy and interesting characteristics of Barcelona is its dynamism: the city has continually re-invented itself by fusing art, history, politics, environmental concern, and commerce in what is generally considered to be a model of urban planning and development.

Student Quotes
“Having small class sizes allowed for much greater communication and I always felt like the professors were looking out for the students. They made sure we were taking full advantage of living abroad and not just drowning in course work.”
-- Kevin Byrne, B.S. CS ‘21
“I recommend this program because of the combination of location and classes. Berlin has so many things to do and so many things to see. The classes offered are mostly classes everyone needs to take for their major. And I loved the street food-- I ate at Curry 36 almost every day!”
-- Brenden Waits, B.S. CS ‘22
“The best part about living in Berlin was immersing myself in the culture. It was great to participate almost as a local and try out the different foods and areas of the city that a tourist might not see. You just can’t get that on a vacation.”
-- Kevin Byrne, B.S. CS ‘21

About Berlin
Berlin is the largest city in Germany, and is an economic, high-tech, and cultural hub for the whole of Europe. The city is probably best known for the famous Berlin Wall, which divided the communist East from the capitalist West during the Cold War. These days, the city is not only reunited, but also a hub for high-tech enterprise, including not only computing but also pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.
The city was founded in the 13th century at the crossing of two important trade routes, and it remains a place where different cultures meet and merge. The city is home to residents from more than 190 countries. Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany, and home to its parliament, called the Bundestag.
Berlin is the only city in the world with three opera houses. The city also houses more than 130 museums and more than 400 art galleries, as well as the world’s oldest large-scale movie studio complex. The Berlin International Film Festival is the largest in the world. And about 20 news agencies and more than 30,000 creative companies are located in Berlin, making it a major capital of culture stretching from the high art of the Renaissance to tomorrow’s industrial designs.
Getting to Berlin is easy, as the city is a major European air and rail hub. Once you arrive, you can use the city’s superb public transit, which includes trains, trams, buses and ferries-- make sure you have a map! Walking through the city is a striking experience, because so many historical periods are represented, stretching from a few remaining medieval buildings near Alexander Platz to the steel-and-glass towers at Potsdamer Platz.
Berlin has a younger population than most European cities, and is known as a place where people constantly produce new ideas-- in research, in commerce, and in art.

Mentoring Program
Mentorship is an important part of a student’s personal and professional development
At the College of Computing, we understand that a student’s college career is about discovery and growth – personally, professionally, and socially. While much of this growth takes place in the typical academic and social environments on campus, it also happens in the individual connections made with peers and alumni.
GT Computing students and alumni have several opportunities to participate in mentorship programs on-campus and virtually.
“Leaving my small, rural hometown for a far and unfamiliar city like Atlanta was a bit unsettling, but also very exciting. The assimilation to my new environment would have been more difficult if I was not part of a community. Instead of being thrown into the college experience alone, I was able to meet people, which made the adjustment more comfortable and enjoyable. By being a mentor, I will be part of that community to make sure each new student’s transition is positive, comfortable and enjoyable.”
Cody Kantor, BS CS ‘22
GT Computing First-Year Cohort Peer Mentor Program
Our primary goal for the first-year peer mentorship program is to assist our incoming students in making the transition to the College of Computing and the greater GT community as positive, and seamless, as possible. Through this program, mentors serve as campus role models and provide guidance to incoming students as they adjust to college life, become aware of campus culture and resources, and engage in various activities within the College of Computing and across campus.
Peer mentors are paired together in groups of 2-44 to support one of the incoming cohorts of computing students. Mentors can expect an average time commitment of about 1 hour per week during the summer and about 3 hours per week during the fall semester. In addition to the responsibilities below, mentors will receive monthly training on key topics associated with adjusting to the first year of college, as well as the opportunity to participate in select events and activities.
The responsibilities of a mentor include:
· Being a TA for CS 1100
· Communicating with incoming students during the summer and fall through social media, email, and other forms of communication
· Participating in 1 social event with their mentees each month throughout the fall semester
**Due to the increased size of the incoming class of 2025, we are seeking additional mentors for summer/fall 2021. If you are interested in becoming a peer mentor, please submit your completed application to Tamar Wilkins.**

In general, we expect students who enter the program to be very comfortable working with multiple programming languages such as C, Java, and Python (there is no provision within the program for make-up any deficiencies) and to have taken several more advanced topics, such as Advanced OS, Networking, Theory, and/or Algorithms.
7. What can I do to be competitive? What do you recommend for applicants without a CS undergraduate background?
The following is what we recommend for applicants without a strong undergraduate background in computer science:
1. Must know how to program
2. C programming (proficient)
3. Java
4. Algorithms
You can gain this knowledge through undergrad classes, MOOC, or learn it through work experience.
8. What types of prerequisite courses?
The student should have an undergraduate level of proficiency in core computer science areas including operating systems, design and analysis of algorithms, formal languages and automata theory, networking and communications, theory/algorithms, and computer architecture. If any remedial coursework is needed, it will be assessed by our faculty and discussed with you during orientation.
9. My GRE score is below your minimum, can I still apply and be considered for admission?
You would not be automatically disqualified from consideration. Applicant scores are expected to be at least 153 in the Verbal, 155 in the Quantitative, and 3.0 in the Analytical sections for the MS program. We consider the strength of your overall application, including your educational and professional background, your performance at prior institutions (GPA), statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation. All of these factors are important, and your application will be strengthened if your GRE scores are at or above these average values. If your GRE scores are lower than these averages, your chances for admission will be reduced. You may retake the GRE, TOEFL, or IELTS to improve your score as many times as you wish. We will accept the highest score attained in each category.
10. My TOEFL is below the minimum, can I still apply and be considered for admission?
You are welcome to apply however, we generally do not accept applicants with less than 100 because most of our applicants exceed the minimum TOEFL. You may want to consider retaking the TOEFL.
11. Do you accept IELTS?
Beginning Spring 2020, we will accept IELTS in place of TOEFL. A minimum overall score of 7.5 is required, with minumum section scores as follows: Reading 6.5, Listening 6.5, Speaking 6.5, Writing 5.5.
12. What is the Department Code to request my GRE and TOEFL scores?
As long as you request the test from ETS using Institute Code 5248 we will receive the scores. When test scores are received from ETS and entered into Georgia Tech system, they are available for all degree programs to view.
13. What is the application deadline?
Students are admitted to the master’s program only once a year. The application deadline is February 1 for admission to the following fall semester.
14. When do you admit new students? What about Summer and Spring?
Students are admitted to the master’s program only once a year. The application deadline is February 1 for admission to the following fall semester. We do not admit for Summer or Spring.
15. I have a master’s degree (MSCS, or another degree). Can I still apply to your program?
Yes.
16. I completed a three-year bachelor’s degree. Am I eligible?
If you have a three-year bachelor's degree and a post bachelor's degree including the one-year postgraduate diploma, you should be eligible to matriculate as a degree-seeking student. The Office of Graduate Studies is the ultimate arbiter regarding whether or not a student can matriculate as degree-seeking. Please consult their webpage on three-year bachelor's degrees to learn more.
17. What should I say in my application Statement of Purpose?
The statement of purpose allows you to highlight areas of your background or interests that may not be clear in other areas of your application. Therefore, it is very important to write a clear and concise statement that expresses your interest in the program, and what you hope to gain from, or bring to, the program of study. You may address special features of the program that made it the right fit for you, or you may address specific topics that you are interested in studying. You may wish to address aspects of your personal, academic, and work-related experiences that would make effective contributions to the program or would showcase your knowledge and interest in your chosen area of study. This statement should be concise, outline a plan for graduate studies, and indicate why Georgia Tech is the right graduate program to meet this plan. It should include what you plan to accomplish with our MSCS degree, and what we should remember about you when considering your application.
18. Whom should I ask to write my recommendation letters?
Three letters of recommendation are required and it is recommended that at least one of your recommendations come from faculty (it is not required to provide computer science faculty recommender) who are familiar with your academic performance.
At least one of the letters must be from a professor.
The letters of recommendation are submitted online. Information regarding the submission of the letters is given in the directions for submitting your online application.
Please visit these links for more information regarding recommendation letters:
19. How can I check the status of my application or check if my application materials have been received by Georgia Tech?

You are welcome to visit faculty members in your area of interest to ascertain if GRA (Graduate Research Assistantship) support is available. GRA is not guaranteed, but if you have a particular skill that a faculty member needs on a project, it can happen. Start looking as soon as possible. Often students find a GRA position during or by the end of their first semester. A few meet faculty during the “Admitted Students Visit” in the spring or use email and have one when they arrive in August, but very few students are able to do this. When working as a GTA (Graduate Teaching Assistant), you are required to have completed the course or its equivalent and scored an “A” grade. You should be prepared to cover at least your first semester as an out of state student. GRA and GTA positions provide a 12-credit tuition waiver, along with a monthly stipend based on percentage time worked) and a waiver of all but $25 of the tuition. With a GRA, students can expect to work 15 to 20 hours per week in addition to school work. Students are responsible for the mandatory fees and tuition supplement.
33. Where do I view my admission decision?
Please view your decision letter on the Applicant Status Portal, Once a decision has been made, you will receive a notification that an update has been made to your Application Status Portal.

You will also have an opportunity to meet with a College of Computing faculty member during orientation. Please visit the New Student checklist for helpful information.
You may want to join a community on the web and communicate with current and former students. There are fantastic resources to answer your questions. You can do your research to find a resource.
36. I was admitted to a different degree program and would like to switch to MSCS. Do you allow students to change majors?
Unfortunately, you are admitted only to the program to which you applied. If you want to switch to MSCS, you will have to apply again to the next available admit term. We do not accept change of majors into the MSCS program.
37. I am currently pursuing an MS CS at a different institution and would like to transfer to your program. Do you allow students to transfer?
Students are not allowed to transfer to our program as they must apply with all other applicants. Learn more at our MS CS admissions requirements page.
Georgia Tech Master’s students are only allowed to transfer in a maximum of 6 credit hours.
38. I was denied admission. I am disappointed that I was not accepted into your program. I feel that my record is very good. Can I find out what was wrong with my application?
Admission decisions are final. Our degree program is extremely competitive and due to space and financial limitations we can only enroll a small number of students and must decline many qualified applicants. The decision to accept is based on many factors including the GPA, letters of recommendation, GRE, area of interest of the student, TOEFL, available funding for students who want to pursue a Ph.D., specific faculty interest in the student, and available space. Many of these factors are not visible to students. Unfortunately, due to the volume of applicants, we cannot give specific feedback for any one student.

Georgia Tech to Dismantle Pervasive Cyberattacks in 10 Seconds or Less
Georgia Tech researchers have been awarded a $2.9 million contract from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop a cybersecurity method that will identify and defend against low-volume distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
High-volume DDoS attacks that overwhelm servers with large amounts of malicious traffic in order to shut down a particular website have received a significant amount of study. However, low-volume attacks have not.
Low-volume attacks—while generally receiving less attention from scholars and media outlets—account for a significant percentage of all DDoS assaults. They can take down a website and be as damaging, but may use less bandwidth, are often shorter in duration, and may be designed to distract a security team from the aftershocks of follow-on attacks. In fact, according to Neustar, Inc., around 54 percent of DDoS attacks were found to be relatively small at less than 5 Gbps, yet 43 percent leave behind malware or viruses. Neustar’s April 2016 report found that 82 percent of corporations were attacked repeatedly.
“This has been a 25-year problem with no practical solution,” says Taesoo Kim, lead principal investigator for the study and assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Computer Science. “Our goal is to create a precise and timely detection method that identifies attacks by how they subtly change the resource consumption of a machine. With little to no degradation of system performance, we believe we can mitigate the threat and write a new signature for it inside the hardware within approximately 10 seconds so a network interface card will recognize it again. This effectively puts an anti-virus patch into your hardware in real time.”
Under the project name ROKI, Kim and colleagues propose to first establish a baseline of resource consumption using three Intel hardware features. Next, they will develop continuous analysis algorithms to compare a packet’s effect on system performance against historical consumption under similar scenarios. A new path-reconstruction engine will then produce a sequence of instructions to nullify an attack and encode the finding into the network interface card to stop current or future attack traffic.
“ROKI has the potential to achieve both timeliness and precision,” says Wenke Lee, co-PI on the project and co-director of the Institute for Information Security & Privacy at Georgia Tech. “We don’t need to know what an attack looks like, just that it deviates from the baseline. Existing defenses against low-volume DDoS attacks lack precision and they cannot create a response in a timely manner. This will.”
The research is part of DARPA’s Extreme DDoS Defense (XD3) program (awarded under contract #HR0011-16-C-0059) and began in April. First deliverables are expected in approximately 18 months, beginning with a prototype to demonstrate the core idea. The project is expected to be complete in three years. Field exercises to mitigate previously unknown DDoS attacks will occur in 2019.
Mynatt Takes Helm of Computing Consortium
Beth Mynatt, professor in the School of Interactive Computing and executive director of Georgia Tech’s Institute for People and Technology, will assume the role of chair of the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), beginning July 1.
Mynatt has served on the CCC since its formation and was previously vice-chair of the organization. She has spearheaded activities forging research collaborations in healthcare and health information technologies. Recently, Mynatt was one of the lead organizers for the CCC and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Aging in Place Workshop, which led to a National Institutes of Health (NIH) new program for Collaborative Aging (in Place) Research Using Technology (CART) (U2C). Conclusions from that workshop were also integrated into the recent PCAST report on "Independence, Technology and Connection in Older Age," which Mynatt helped co-author.
"The CCC has a terrific track record in convening the computing research community to act on strategic national interests," Mynatt said. "I'm excited and daunted to take the reins for the next two years as the computing field and our nation are going through transformative changes. Computing capabilities are intrinsic to much of our society. Our field faces unprecedented opportunities and responsibilities."
Mynatt has been a member of the CCC executive committee for the past four years. She recently co-chaired the Computing Visions 2025 steering committee to advise the National Science Foundation (NSF) on future, and potentially disruptive, trends for future computing research. The Visions 2025 meetings focused on emergent cyber-social-physical systems that powerfully combine computing and interactions with people and the physical world.
Professor Annie Antón, chair of the Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing, said, "Dr. Mynatt's new role as CCC chair demonstrates her national leadership in computing research. Consistent with Georgia Tech President Bud Peterson's commitment to sharing 'what Georgia Tech thinks,' she will be enabling the highest-quality thinking nationwide about our technological future."
The CCC was established in 2006 through a cooperative agreement between the Computing Research Association (CRA) and the NSF. CCC conducts activities that strengthen the research community, articulate compelling research visions, and align those visions with pressing national and global challenges. CCC communicates the importance of those visions to policymakers, government and industry stakeholders, the public, and the research community itself. The council consists of a chair, vice chair, executive committee, and 15 council members from various academic institutions and industries across the country.
The organization is based at the CRA’s headquarters in Washington, DC. To learn more about CCC and its mission, visit its website.
Three College of Computing Faculty Earn GT FIRE Awards
Three College of Computing faculty members recently earned Georgia Tech Fund for Innovation in Research and Education (GT FIRE) awards.
Professors Gregory Abowd, Ashok Goel (School of Interactive Computing) and Constantine Dovrolis (School of Computer Science) each had proposals funded for academic year 2016-17. The Offices of the Provost and Executive Vice President for Research award funding annually to support new collaborative programs that are deemed to be innovative and potentially transformative.
To be eligible for consideration, each professor had to submit a research or educational project summary detailing their transformative idea and its potential impact, as well as a project budget for the estimated $40,000 award.
Abowd will use the award to fund ongoing research into ubiquitous computing and his vision of “catalyzing the next generation of information technology” with “computational skin” that may cover everyday objects. Goel’s GT FIRE funding will support his continuing work to develop virtual teaching assistants like the now-famous “Jill Watson” from his Spring 2016 artificial intelligence online course.
Dovrolis is part of an interdisciplinary team that includes members from the Schools of Biomedical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering. Their project goal is to develop methods needed to build a multi-layer model that can characterize the paths of the brain’s activity over time.
College of Computing Using Google Funding to Close CS Diversity Gap
It’s no secret that female, African American, Hispanic, Native American, and Alaskan Native students are underrepresented in computer science in Georgia and across the country.
In fact, according to ongoing data analysis by Barbara Ericson, director of computing outreach for the Institute for Computing Education (ICE) for the Georgia Tech College of Computing, “The disparity here is so great that in 2015 10 U.S. states had fewer than 10 girls take the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science (CS) A course exam while 23 states had fewer than 10 black students take the exam.”
In an interview with the New York Times late last year, Ericson said working to solve the tech industry’s gender and racial diversity gap is important “because we don’t have enough people studying computer science in the United States to fill the projected number of jobs in the field.”
To address this problem and prepare more high school students for computer science careers, the College of Computing established RISE Up 4 CS in 2012.
Leveraging Google RISE Award funding, the RISE Up 4 CS program offers twice-a-week webinars and monthly in person sessions at Georgia Tech to prepare underrepresented students to succeed in taking the APCS A course exam and class. For the webinars, students use a free interactive e-book developed by Ericson to learn about searching and sorting data, and the fundamentals of JAVA.
Since Rise Up 4 CS began, each year a new record number of underrepresented students have passed the AP CS A exam. “While we can't claim that the record number is all due to RISE Up 4 CS, several students have told us they wouldn't have passed the exam without it,” said Ericson.
Prepping students for success this summer
With its third consecutive Google RISE Award, this year the College of Computing and RISE UP 4 CS are supporting two summer day camps for eligible students enrolled in an AP CS A course during the upcoming 2016-2017 school year.
Students attending the summer day camps will create games, 3D movies, and picture manipulation programs while they learn the fundamental concepts, skills, and algorithms. “We want to empower these students with the tools they’ll need to be successful in these challenging courses,” said Ericson.
The College of Computing is partnering with area educational institutions to host the weeklong camps. The first session will be held July 18 through 22 at Holy Innocents’ Episcopal School. The second sessions begins July 25 at Morehouse College and runs through July 29.
Eligible students can apply online for either of the two, five-day camp sessions. The camps are free and include lunch and a snack for students. Each camp has a maximum of 20 students.
The Google RISE Awards is an annual grant program for informal education organizations around the world that promote computer science for underrepresented K-12/pre-university age youth.
Minding Your Business: Cybersecurity in Georgia
A growing number of Georgia companies are devoted to preventing and containing damage from data breaches at businesses and government agencies. The information security industry, known as info-sec, is fueled by research at Georgia Tech, a cluster of well-funded start-ups from alumni and entrepreneurs, and concentration of the Army's Cyber Command at Fort Gordon. Dr. Wenke Lee describes the components of this "perfect storm" for Georgia Trend magazine.
Georgia Tech Set to Host Two Turing Award Winners
In the world of computing, there is no higher honor than being selected as a recipient of the prestigious A.M. Turing Award. The annual prize is presented by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and is considered by many to be the “Nobel Prize” for computing.
With only 42 living recipients, it’s not often that a Turing Award winner visits Georgia Tech to share a lecture or participate in a public forum. That’s why it is such a rare honor that not one, but two Turing Award winners are set to be on campus in the next month.
Renowned computer scientist and 1992 Turing Award winner Butler Lampson is presenting a Capital One Fall ’16 Distinguished Lecture, Sept. 27. Sponsored by the Institute of Information Security and Privacy (IISP), the presentation is titled, “Retroactive Security.” Lampson will share his perspective on why it is time to change the way we think about computer security. The event is free, but registration is required.
The second laureate speaking on campus is 1995 Turing Award recipient Manuel Blum. Currently serving as the Bruce Nelson Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, Blum will present a lecture titled, “Human Computation with an Application to Passwords.” This event is scheduled for Oct. 27 at 11 a.m. and is hosted by the Algorithms and Randomness Center (ARC).
Noted computer scientist Lenore Blum is also speaking on campus, Oct. 27. She will present the College of Computing’s annual John P. Imlay Jr. Distinguished Lecture. Blum’s presentation, titled “Alan Turing and the Other Theory of Computation,” begins at 5 p.m. in the Howey Physics Building. Blum, a Distinguished Career Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, is married to Manuel Blum.
The Turing Award honors Alan Mathison Turing (1912–1954), a British mathematician and computer scientist. He is widely known for his innovative work advancing computer architecture, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. Turing was also key to British code-breaking efforts during World War II. Presented each year by the ACM, the prize given to "an individual selected for contributions of a technical nature made to the computing community" that are of “lasting and major technical importance to the computer field.”
Two New Interdisciplinary Research Centers Shaping Future of Computing
Georgia Tech is meeting the future of computing head on as it stands up two new research centers.
Machine Learning at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) and the Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH), both officially launched on July 1, are tackling major challenges that need to be overcome to advance computing.
“Although both are being led by College of Computing faculty members, these interdisciplinary research centers bring together some of the brightest minds from across the campus to solve extremely difficult problems,” said John P. Imlay Jr. Dean Zvi Galil. “The work these centers are undertaking is crucial to the advancement of computing, and strengthens Georgia Tech’s position at the vanguard of computer science.”
Machine Learning @ Georgia Tech
Based in the College of Computing, ML@GT represents all of Georgia Tech. It is tasked with pushing forward the ability for computers to learn from observations and data. As one of the fastest-growing research areas in computing, machine learning spans many disciplines that use data to discover scientific principles, infer patterns, and extract meaningful knowledge.
According to School of Interactive Computing Professor Irfan Essa, inaugural director of ML@GT, machine learning (ML) has reached a new level of maturity and is now impacting all aspects of computing, engineering, science, and business.
“We are in the era of aggregation, of collecting data,” said Essa. “However, machine learning is now propelling data analysis, and the whole concept of interpreting that data, toward a new era of making sense of the data, using it to make meaningful connections between information, and acting upon it in innovative ways that bring the most benefit to the most people.”
The new center begins with more than 100 affiliated faculty members from five Georgia Tech colleges and the Georgia Tech Research Institute, as well as some jointly affiliated with Emory University.
Machine Learning is the new calculus
In addition to leading research, ML@GT is focused on developing human capital in machine learning. According to Dean Galil, “There is extensive demand for these classes from students in all majors across campus. Machine learning is the new calculus and it is showing.”
There are currently more than 200 undergraduate and 250 graduate students enrolled in introductory ML courses.
“I meet people in finance, hardware, logistics, and other industries that either want to know how machine learning can change their business or they want to hire somebody with in-depth knowledge of machine learning,” said Essa.
To meet this growing demand, students, researchers, and faculty at ML@GT focus on three areas: examining the foundations of ML theory; building upon existing technologies at the application level; and adapting ML algorithms in different domains.
With leading computing, statistics, and optimization experts as part of the team, a primary area of focus for ML@GT is delving into the foundations of ML theory.
These foundational building blocks include:
- Dynamic data and decision-making – building systems that can continuously update and process new data streams in order to make informed decisions.
- Neural Computation – creating more efficient and powerful computational processes inspired by biological systems.
- Data Mining and Anomaly Detection – developing new ways to detect anomalies that may be indicators of fraud, disease, or structural defects.
- Interactive Machine Learning – designing systems that can develop and learn from interaction with humans.
- Artificial Intelligence – strengthening the foundational roots of ML to build machines that can accomplish increasingly complex tasks and functions.
- Ethics and bias – considering the ethical implications and appropriate limitations of ML and its evolving roles in research, industry, and culture, and how biased inputs can affect outcomes.
At the application level, ML@GT is pushing established ML tools and practices forward to create more innovative modeling and predictive capabilities. These capabilities will focus on healthcare, education, logistics and operations, sensors and detection, social computing, information systems, security, and privacy, and financial markets. They will also be used to reveal informative patterns and identify abnormal behavior in these and other application areas.
ML@GT is also going inside the application level to research new ways of applying ML knowledge to new disciplines.
“Sometimes it is just not sufficient to take an existing algorithm and apply a new dataset to it,” said Essa. “You have to go inside the machinery in order to understand how to adapt the algorithm to a new domain.”
“This is the starting point. In the first year, we want to develop additional focal points, further strengthen the center’s educational mission, and move forward with establishing a machine learning Ph.D. program at Georgia Tech.”
As for ML@GT’s longer-term goals, Essa said, “Within five years we fully expect Georgia Tech will be a global leader, and the center will be recognized as the international home for advanced machine learning research and education.”
Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies
Just as ML@GT is working to move machine learning into a new era, CRNCH is focused on getting over one of the biggest hurdles facing computing today: the impending end of Moore’s Law.
“We knew that at some point physics would come into play. We hit that wall around 2005,” said Tom Conte, inaugural director of CRNCH and professor in Georgia Tech’s schools of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering.
Since the 1960s, Moore’s Law has essentially held that, for a given price point, the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles roughly every two years. However, there are hard limits to building smaller integrated circuits because, as transistors get smaller they become less energy efficient. The problem gets worse as the chips get faster.
“We’ve gotten by since 2005 using multiple, slower-clocked cores per chip-- 'multicore processing,' in essence -- but it’s only a partial solution,” said Conte. “Very soon, computing’s historic performance growth rate will no longer be sustainable.”
In fact, according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Rebooting Computing Initiative (of which Conte is a founding member and current co-chair) this inevitability means that wholesale changes are needed in both computing technologies and computer architecture if the next level of high-performance supercomputing – machines capable of 10 million trillion floating-point operations per second (10 exaflops) – is to be achieved.
To facilitate these fundamental changes, Conte, along with School of Computational Science and Engineering Chair David Bader, Charlotte B. and Roger C. Warren Chair of Computing Richard DeMillo, Frederick G. Storey Chair in Computing Richard Lipton, Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar and Rhesa "Ray" S. Farmer, Jr. Distinguished Chair in Embedded Computing Systems Marilyn Wolf, and other Georgia Tech faculty proposed the establishment of a new interdisciplinary research center.
This IRC would take the lead in breaking down traditional barriers between computing’s various facets, such as devices, circuits, architecture, software, and algorithms, in order to restart the exponential growth rate embodied in Moore’s Law.
The proposal has come to fruition in the form of CRNCH.
“We didn’t want to be a close follower in the space,” said Conte. “By leveraging the broad, interdisciplinary talent that exists here, Georgia Tech is well-poised to become the international leader in novel computing hierarchies. In doing so, we firmly believe Georgia Tech will be the global epicenter of a new computing economy.”
To achieve the bold breakthroughs necessary to propel computing to the exascale level and beyond, CRNCH researchers are evaluating a number of possibilities.
“Several promising research areas have been identified,” said Conte. “However some are more disruptive to the computer stack than others.”
Some of the possible solutions that have been identified by the IEEE Rebooting Computing Initiative for further research include:
- Quantum computing – uses properties of quantum mechanics to solve optimization problems.
- Neuromorphic computing – leverages what is known about the human brain to create new technologies.
- Approximate and stochastic computing – complementary approaches based on the observation that computers often calculate results to higher than required accuracy and precision.
- Adiabatic and reversible computing – recycles unused inputs and utilizes non-traditional devices for substantial power savings
- Cryogenic superconducting – uses low-temperature superconducting materials to conserve energy.
The CRNCH team includes experts in each of these focus areas. However, Conte said, “It’s important to note that these general approaches are only a sampling of what may be possible and other approaches and techniques are actively being explored by the team.”
With the team in place and the center open for business, Conte expects CRNCH to quickly take a leading role in researching new computer hierarchies and become recognized as the academic research embodiment IEEE’s rebooting computing initiative.
“Within three years we firmly believe that CRNCH will be providing international leadership and have significant influence on the development of new computer hierarchies,” said Conte. “ We also believe that CRNCH will establish Midtown Atlanta as a hotspot for this new computing technology.”
NSF Funded Project May Increase Water and Energy Supplies
In the not-too-distant future, water and energy harvested by individuals, communities, and other non-traditional systems – think rain barrels, greywater recycling, solar panels, and windmills – may be integrated into centralized municipal networks.
With these added resources flowing into existing municipal systems, water and energy supplies around the world could become more sustainable, more resilient, and more secure in the face of potential natural disasters and possible security threats.
However, according to School of Computational Science and Engineering Assistant Professor Bistra Dilkina, getting to a point where this is possible on a broad scale is not going to be easy.
“While the benefits of these integrated systems will be huge, there are also many potential problems to be solved,” said Dilkina. “Without careful planning and design, there could be unintended consequences such as unexpected interdependencies, over-production, conflicts in resource acquisition, and an overall greater use of resources.”
To better understand the complexities of integrating decentralized resources with existing resource networks, Dilkina, along with postdoctoral fellow Zhongming Lu of the Brook Byers Institute of Sustainable Systems and others, is undertaking a two-year, $246,500-plus project titled, “Sustainable and Resilient Design of Interdependent Water and Energy Systems at the Infrastructure-Human-Resource Nexus."
The project is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and is one of 15 projects being funded this year as part of a recently announced $22.7 million investment to strengthen the nation's critical infrastructure. This is a collaborative project with a complementary grant led by a research team at the University of New Hampshire (UNH).
"The projects being funded…are making it possible to deeply embed computation into physical systems and improve the safety, security, and resilience of our critical infrastructures," said Jim Kurose, NSF's assistant director for Computer and Information Science and Engineering. "These 'smart' critical infrastructures will in turn positively impact many aspects of our daily lives and have profound benefits for our nation."
According to Dilkina, the project’s principal investigator, one of the primary goals of the Georgia Tech and the UNH projects is to be able to inform decision-makers about possible outcomes and tradeoffs in different decentralized water and energy adoption scenarios, taking into account the interdependence between water and energy infrastructures.
“The project facilitates the planning and design of decentralized systems, and informs policy development to create more sustainable and resilient infrastructure systems for urban communities,” said Dilkina.
To achieve the project goals, the research team will use survey tools and a crowdsourcing platform to engage stakeholders and gather data. This information will be used to develop spatial agent-based models, spatial optimization models, and other machine learning and computational methods that can reveal patterns, trajectories, and anomalies in a variety of usage scenarios.
“The analysis will be done using future demographic, climate, and technology scenarios,” said Dilkina. “In the end, we will better understand and be able to characterize possible best-case outcomes, inform policy decisions, and determine the impact of incentive/disincentive programs.”
Atlanta and Boston have been selected to participate in this project as testbeds to develop the required modeling framework.
Two GT Computing Students Named Semifinalists for Mr. Georgia Tech
With Homecoming Week fast approaching, two College of Computing students are among 10 semifinalists vying for the title of Mr. Georgia Tech.
According to the Georgia Tech Homecoming Facebook page, Kyle Woumn and Andrew Perry, both computer science majors, have been nominated to represent the Institute next week during the Homecoming celebration as Mr. Georgia Tech.
Voting for Mr. and Ms. Georgia Tech, which is only open to students, opened today and runs through October 26. This follows a rigorous interview and presentation process that narrowed a larger field to 10 nominees for each. The winners will be revealed during halftime of the Homecoming Game against Duke on Oct. 29.
Kyle Woumn is a 5th-year student from Decatur, Georgia. Kyle has had a variety of remarkable experiences while at Tech, including studying abroad through the Spain LBAT program and interning in San Francisco with Twilio.
As a mentorship advocate, Woumn has been involved with the Office of Minority Educational Development EDGE Mentorship Program, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc, the New Student and Sophomore Program’s KNIT Mentorship Program Executive Board, the Center for Engineering Education and Diversity’s Peer-to-Peer Mentorship Program, and the Student Government Association, where he served as one of two College of Computing representatives.
Kyle has also served as the Public Relations Chair and Finance Chair for the Georgia Tech Chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, his sponsoring organization.
Andrew Perry is a 4th-year student from Peachtree City, Georgia. Since he began at Georgia Tech, Perry has become known for working to improve the student experience for all Yellow Jackets and currently serves as the Director of the Mental Health Student Coalition. He also reaches out to new students and supports the Tech community by volunteering as a Georgia Tech Ambassador and a FASET leader.
Perry also serves as the Vice President of Omicron Delta Kappa and is a member on the Student Advisory Board for the Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education.
Along with relaxing by the Campanile, Perry also enjoys dancing in Mock Rock, and tinkering with tech in the GVU Lab. His brothers in the Delta Chi fraternity nominated Perry for Mr. Georgia Tech.
SCS Professor Earns Air Force Award to Enable Machine Learning in Drones
Georgia Institute of Technology School of Computer Science (SCS) Assistant Professor Hadi Esmaeilzadeh is receiving one of 58 grants totaling nearly $20.8 million from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research’s (AFOSR) Young Investigator Research Program (YIP).
Esmaeilzadeh’s YIP award, approximately $360,000 over three years, will support his research to develop a novel many-core architecture for machine learning and control algorithms in drones and autonomous vehicles.
“This is a significant accomplishment for Hadi,” said SCS Chair Lance Fortnow. “It will allow him to move forward with this important work and it furthers Georgia Tech’s reputation for groundbreaking research.”
Esmaeilzadeh’s research proposal, “Accelerated System Design for Perception and Control in Energy-Constrained UAVs,” was selected from among hundreds of proposals submitted to make the final list of funded projects.
Esmaeilzadeh’s primary research areas include computer architecture, programming languages, and machine learning. These research areas are key to pushing past current limitations of the existing generation of drones and unmanned vehicles.
“The use of drones for all types of missions has increased dramatically during the past decade,” said Esmaeilzadeh. “However, a lack of true autonomy, short battery life, and the need for constant communication make them vulnerable.”
To counter these shortcomings, Esmaeilzadeh will conduct basic research to develop a unified, cross-stack solution that will help make drones and similar autonomous vehicles smarter, more energy efficient, and more self-sufficient. This research plans to merge software and hardware to accelerate machine learning and stochastic control via a novel many-core accelerator, allowing unmanned vehicles to better perceive their surroundings and make more informed decisions. Other improvements would include extended flight time and a reduced need for human guidance.
The grant will also support Esmaeilzadeh’s research in field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), which have shown promise in improving the efficiency of machine learning. Esmaeilzadeh received recognition for his FPGA research earlier this year during the 22nd International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, where he and his fellow researchers earned the “Distinguished Paper Award.”
The prestigious YIP grant is given to scientists and engineers at research institutions who have received their Ph.D. or equivalent degrees in the past five years and that demonstrate “exceptional ability and promise for conducting basic research,” according to the award’s webpage.

Amazon Research Awards Fund Computer Vision and Machine Learning Projects
Georgia Institute of Technology assistant professors Dhruv Batra and Devi Parikh, both in the College of Computing’s School of Interactive Computing, received Amazon Academic Research Awards (AARA) for a pair of projects they are leading in computer vision and machine learning.
They received $100,000 each from Amazon -- $80,000 in gift money and $20,000 in Amazon Web Services credit – in December for projects that aim to produce the next generation of artificial intelligence (AI) agents.
One, Visual Dialog, requires an AI agent to hold a meaningful dialog with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. The other is called Counting Everyday Objects in Everyday Scenes and aims to enable an AI to do just that.
The former project is led by Batra. His main goal is to build a visual chatbot, or an AI agent with the ability to have a natural conversation about visual content. In other words, you could ask it a question about a specific uploaded image – how many people are in the image, for example – and the AI would reply with an accurate answer (“There are five people”).
“Then, I could ask a follow-up question like, ‘What are they doing?’ and the bot would answer, ‘One is jumping,’” Batra explained.
The process to accomplish this relies on a subfield of machine learning called deep learning. In order to train deep neural networks to accomplish a task, Batra suggests that they can collect a large data set where two humans interact with each other about an image. One asks a question and the other answers. Their conversations are recorded and used to train machine learning models to produce the desired responses.
“We can show a machine that when a question is asked about this image, this is how you should respond,” Batra said.
This requires a large data set, as many as 200,000 conversations on the same set of images, each conversation including 10 rounds of questions and answers to equate to roughly two million question-and-answer pairs.
The latter project, led by Parikh, focuses on counting objects in images.
“If I give the machine any image, can we get machines to count the number of objects of each category in that scene?” she said. “Are there chairs? How many chairs? Are there tables? How many tables? How many people? And so on.”
This project also leverages deep learning. In particular, Parikh’s lab will build artificial neural network architectures that try to count objects in a variety of ways.
One particularly interesting approach will try to estimate the counts of objects at one shot by just glancing at the image as a whole. This is inspired by subitizing, an ability humans have to see a small number of objects and know how many there are without having to explicitly count.
Other models Parikh’s lab is developing have the ability to estimate partial counts from parts of objects and incorporate contextual information. For instance, in an office scene if there are two desks, there are probably at least two chairs.
Both projects are broadly applicable. Notably, both could be used to aid visually impaired users. Parikh suggested the latter project could help in automatic inventory management, as well.
“For example, it’s of interest to Amazon in particular because they have these warehouses and, for a while at least, they just had people walking around and counting how many boxes there are and what each type is,” she said. “If you can have an automatic agent that can just count, it can save a lot of money for these companies.”
Batra and Parikh run labs that collaborate on many projects. They will work together on the intersection of these two in particular.
Likelihood of Dieting Success Lies Within Your Tweets
There is a direct link between a person’s attitude on social media and the likelihood that their dieting efforts will succeed.
In fact, Georgia Institute of Technology researchers have determined that dieting success – or failure – can be predicted with an accuracy rate of 77 percent based on the sentiment of the words and phrases one uses on Twitter.
“We see that those who are more successful at sticking to their daily dieting goals express more positive sentiments and have a greater sense of achievement in their social interactions,” said Assistant Professor Munmun De Choudhury, who is lead researcher on the project. “They are focused on the future, generally more social and have larger social networks.”
Words and phrases like “Train smart like a trainer…win like 6-time champion [sic],” “If your not failing your not trying hard enough…[sic],” and “If we never stumble we never fall. If we never fall we never fail, and if we never fail we never grow!” are some examples of the upbeat and self-reflective language the research indicates is most common to successful dieters.
Other traits of successful dieters are that they tend to be more focused on topics related to health and fitness, and they are more socially interactive.
“We see that these users are much more likely to share healthy recipes, offer tips on nutrition and exercise, and report on their own progress,” said De Choudhury. “Their larger network of friends and followers, and increased engagement, means that they tend to also have stronger support systems, which positively impacts the likelihood of dieting compliance.”
As for those who are not successful in meeting dietary goals, their Twitter content often has a demonstrably negative tone and they tend to be more uneasy and fearful in their posts.
“These users tend to be more anxious seemingly because of a lack of emotional control, and because of certain activities and events of daily life,” said De Choudhury.
Sample posts here include, “I’m pretty sure I’m going to lose my mind. Completely lose what little is left. I cry at the thought of stupid things...” and “Feel rough as old boots this morning :/ Ankle hurts, shin hurts, chest hurts, head hurts.”
While the study of Twitter in isolation can reveal insights into users’ health status, this research breaks new ground in that the study group consists of individuals who have connected their MyFitnessPal (MFP) – a calorie-counting app – and Twitter accounts.
“These areas have been individually observed to glean health indicators,” explained De Choudhury. “However, considering these data sources together and applying an established causality testing methodology allows us to validate for the very first time the efficacy of social media and quantified self-sensing in revealing risk to diet compliance.”
The research looks at more than 2 million tweets and 100,000+ daily MFP entries from nearly 700 individuals. Twitter’s official streaming API was used to identify qualified users by searching publicly shared posts with the hashtag “#myfitnesspal” and that contained an embedded link.
An individual’s MFP food diary entries were coupled with Twitter posts from the corresponding time period. From this, adherence to their set dieting goals was compared to attitudes and behaviors expressed in the tweets.
Tweets were analyzed for linguistic attributes that reveal connections between a person’s behavioral expression and their health and wellbeing. Along with affective and cognitive aspects, the linguistic style of the tweets was also examined.
In future, De Choudhury suggested the new analytical method could be pushed forward to provide greater health and wellbeing benefits.
“For instance, by temporally aligning social media, quantified self-sensing, and self-reported attributes, statistical models may be able to explore dynamics of events around when or how soon an individual’s diet is likely to fail,” said De Choudhury. “This would allow for proactive measures to be taken to help ensure more positive health outcomes.”
A paper titled Computational Approaches Toward Integrating Quantified Self Sensing and Social Media details these findings and is being presented later this month at the 20th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing.
Bo Knows Neural Network Training – Xie in the Spotlight at Machine Learning Workshop
Training neural networks is no easy feat. Just ask Georgia Tech School of Computational Science and Engineering Ph.D. student Bo Xie.
However, in a presentation this week at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at the University of California, Berkeley, Xie suggested a simple approach might be the most effective.
Xie was a guest speaker for a machine learning workshop and presented the event’s Spotlight Talk, titled Semi-Random Units for Learning Neural Networks with Guarantees.
During the talk, Xie described that despite the challenges of solving non-convex optimization problems, there is evidence that simple gradient-based algorithms may be effective in working toward minimizing neural network training errors.
Although these algorithms are widely used in practice, Xie – who expects to graduate this summer – said the jury is still out as to why they work so well in neural network training.
“It is a mystery, in theory, why it would work so well because training a neural network is a difficult, non-convex problem,” said Xie. “This means that gradient descent can easily get stuck in a bad local optimum.”
Bad local optima usually equate to a failure of learning for a neural network. With this failure, the only option is to start over again – possibly an exponential number of times – to achieve a global optimum, which is best described as a definitive best solution.
However, Xie’s research demonstrates that these solutions can be guaranteed with high probability using gradient-based algorithms. In turn, these positive outcomes represent successful learning for a neural network.
“In the short term, this work provides more understanding of the optimization learning landscape for a deep neural network,” said Xie. “We know more about why simple gradient descents will not be stuck in local optimal.
“Beyond this, my hope is that this work will inspire people to design more efficient algorithms for learning neural networks. It will allow us to train a better model with less time.”
Xie first became interested in machine learning as an undergraduate student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. He was intrigued by some early machine learning related technologies like face detection and spam email detection.
“I was fascinated about how to design algorithms that can learn from data instead of being manually programmed to do intelligent tasks,” said Xie.
Following his graduation, Xie plans to be a machine learning researcher in industry.
“I want to work on real-world large-scale problems. It is a really exciting time to do research in machine learning and artificial intelligence since they are transforming our lives in every aspect.”
Xie's primary academic adviser is Assistant Professor Le Song.
Gears Begin Turning for New Center Dedicated to Machine Learning
Faculty members, students, and other guests recently celebrated the launch of the Center for Machine Learning at Georgia Tech (ML@GT).
ML@GT is an interdisciplinary research center with more than 100 affiliated faculty members from five Georgia Tech colleges and the Georgia Tech Research Institute, as well as some jointly affiliated with Emory University.
More than just a kick-off celebration, the event – held April 17 in the Technology Square Research Building – was also an informative workshop for the 100-plus attendees that included panel discussions and a luncheon.
Following his welcoming remarks, College of Computing Dean Zvi Galil, introduced the ML@GT leadership team.
“Our vision is to establish a sustainable interdisciplinary research at Georgia Tech that houses current leaders in machine learning, and trains the next generation of ML pioneers,” said School of Interactive Computing Professor and ML@GT Director Irfan Essa.
“New research paradigms need to be established that move us from the era of aggregation to the era of sense-making and discovery, that improve all workflows with data analysis and knowledge extraction. ML@GT is the premiere home for research that impacts academia, industry, government, and startups,” said Essa.
Highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of ML@GT, a significant part of the workshop was dedicated to rapid-fire presentations from faculty and researchers from across campus. During the 5-minute sessions, each of the 32 presenters shared details about their current research projects benefiting from or related to machine learning.
A reception and poster sessions wrapped up the event. The posters – more than 30 in all – also underscored the wide-ranging implications of machine learning in health care, finance, logistics, robotics, and other industries and disciplines.
Autonomous Monitoring Approach Gives Farmers Detailed 4D Look at Crops
Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Georgia, and Georgia Tech Research Institute have developed a new computer vision-based method of autonomously monitoring agricultural crops that may lower costs, improve harvest yields, and ultimately provide more food to starving people around the world.
Going beyond current crop monitoring techniques used in precision agriculture applications, the Georgia Tech team – led by School of Interactive Computing (IC) Professor Frank Dellaert and Ph.D. student Jing Dong – has created a four-dimensional (4D = 3D + time) reconstruction approach that can provide farmers with detailed crop information including plant heights and growth rates.
Traditionally, crop monitoring has been done manually, which is very labor and cost intensive. Satellites and unmanned aerial and ground vehicles have reduced costs somewhat in recent years, but the amount of useful information that can be gathered from 2D images and 3D reconstructions is limited.
According to the researchers, existing technologies were developed for static scenes. For example, current 3D tools assume that each geometric entity identified in an image will maintain a constant appearance over time.
“Of course, crops are constantly growing, moving in the wind, and changing color, etc., which makes it very difficult to automate the precise alignment of static images over time,” said Dong.
“What we have been able to do is to account for the dynamic nature of continuously growing crops and animate a whole growing season’s worth of 3D images into a 4D reconstruction that reveals a bounty of useful information to farmers and other precision agricultural systems.”
At the heart of the team’s approach is a highly robust data association algorithm that solves the problem of connecting related images over time that have highly duplicated structures, significant lighting and appearance differences.
To fuel the algorithm, the team equipped a standard farm tractor with color imaging, GPS, inertial measurement, and other sensors to collect data from a peanut field in Tifton, Georgia. Data was harvested over 23 sessions spanning 89 days during the 2016 summer growing season.
However, using a tractor presented another hurdle for the team to overcome. Existing methods of creating spatio-temporal maps – a primary tool for location recognition – were designed for autonomous driving applications. In these situations, camera angles remain mostly static as a vehicle moves down the road.
A tractor moving through a cultivated field is a different story.
“So, not only are the plants always changing, the camera angles are constantly shifting as the tractor goes over bumps and through ruts in the soil. Multiple rows and repetitive structures exacerbate the problem even further,” said Dong.
To account for the dynamic nature of the data, the new approach computes geometric details about camera angles and positions, as well as visual landmarks and points of reference for each individual row.
This information, in turn, builds visual correspondences and links each of the 23 data sessions for each specific row. From here, the team uses a search and optimization method to reject possible false positive matches between rows and sessions and to eliminate other outliers that might adversely impact the study results.
The output was a 4D point cloud (a time series of 3D point clouds which are aligned into a single coordinate frame) with 36 million data points.
"With this, we can visualize multiple types of output like height curves, growth rate heat maps, and detailed local mesh models that are accessible by farmers or other precision agriculture systems,” said Dong. "All of this information is very useful for making decisions about irrigation, pest control, harvesting, crop rotations, and much more.
“There is still much to be done as we continue to analyze the data and explore potential machine learning applications, but our ultimate goal is to do all that we can to bring more food to people around the world impacted by food shortages and famine.”
The full paper, 4D Crop Monitoring: Spatio-Temporal Reconstruction for Agriculture, was presented at the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), held in Singapore from May 29 to June 3.
Dellaert and IC Professor Byron Boots advise Dong. The research is supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture under award number 2014-67021-22556.
New Ph.D. Program Highlights Growing Importance of Machine Learning
Eight Georgia Tech schools partner to offer advanced degree in emerging field of machine learning
The Georgia Institute of Technology has been approved to offer a new advanced degree program for the emerging field of machine learning.
In a unanimous vote, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia approved Georgia Tech’s request to establish a Doctor of Philosophy in Machine Learning.
“The field of machine learning is now ubiquitous in everything we do. It impacts everything from robotics and cybersecurity to data analytics – all topics of extraordinary interest to Georgia Tech,” said Rafael L. Bras, Georgia Tech provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs and the K. Harrison Brown Family Chair.
“This new Ph.D. program embraces the interdisciplinary impact and nature of machine learning and serves to strengthen Georgia Tech’s strong position as a leading center of knowledge and expertise in this increasingly important field of study.”
A collaborative approach
The machine learning (ML) Ph.D. program is a collaborative venture between the colleges of Computing, Engineering, and Sciences. An inaugural class of approximately 15 students is scheduled to convene for the Fall 2017 semester. The class is expected to comprise incoming Ph.D. students and some who may have recently begun other programs at Georgia Tech.
Qualified students can apply to the program through one of eight participating schools at Georgia Tech. These include the schools of Computational Science and Engineering, Computer Science, and Interactive Computing in the College of Computing.
Participating schools in the College of Engineering include the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, and the Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering.
Students can also apply for the ML Ph.D. program through the School of Mathematics in the College of Sciences.
“The ML Ph.D. degree program is ideal for students from a variety of academic backgrounds interested in multidisciplinary collaboration,” said Justin Romberg, the Schlumberger Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and program curriculum coordinator for the ML Ph.D. program.
“Students will learn to integrate and apply principles from computing, statistics, optimization, engineering, mathematics, and science to innovate and create machine learning models and then apply them to answer important, real-world, data-intensive questions.”
ML@GT
Although students apply to the program through one of eight schools, the hub for the new ML Ph.D. degree is the Center for Machine Learning at Georgia Tech (ML@GT).
Opened in July 2016 as the home for machine learning at Georgia Tech, ML@GT has more than 100 affiliated faculty members from five Georgia Tech colleges and the Georgia Tech Research Institute, as well as some jointly affiliated with Emory University.
“While there are many faculty members doing machine learning research at Georgia Tech, until now there has been a lack of a structured and systematic interdisciplinary ML training program for students,” said College of Computing Professor and ML@GT Director Irfan Essa.
“Once accepted to the program, students become members of the ML@GT community, where they will be able to develop a solid understanding of fundamental principles across a range of core areas in the machine learning discipline.”
The operations and curricular requirements for the new Ph.D. program – which include five core and five elective courses, a qualifying exam, and a doctoral dissertation defense – will be managed by ML@GT.
The five core courses in the ML Ph.D. degree program are:
- Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning
- Intermediate Statistics
- Machine Learning: Theory and Methods
- Probabilistic Graphical Models and Machine Learning in High Dimensions
- Optimization
“Our goal is to have students develop a deep understanding and expertise in a specific theoretical aspect or application area of the machine learning discipline,” said Romberg.
“The students will be able to apply and integrate the knowledge and skills they have developed and demonstrate their expertise and proficiency in an application area of practical importance.”
After successfully completing all of the curricular requirements, students will have the computational skills and mathematical modeling skills needed for careers in industry, government, or academia.
“Machine learning is helping industries – from aerospace and biomedicine to cybersecurity and financial services – make sense of data to improve business processes and identify previously hidden connections that benefit their businesses and their customers,” said Essa.
“Beyond this, machine learning is fueling a rapid development of stronger, more robust artificial intelligence applications, like natural language processing, that may help to solve many of the world’s more complex and longstanding problems.”
What Machine Learning Will Change (Hint: Everything)
This article first appeared in the Summer 2017 issue of the Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine and is used here with permission.
Is that an image of a cat? It’s a simple question for human beings, but was a tough one for machines—until recently. Today, if you type “Siamese cats” into Google’s image search engine, voilà!, you’ll be presented with scores of Siamese cats, categorized by breed (“lilac point,” “totie point,” “chocolate point”), as well as other qualities, such as “kitten” or “furry.”
What’s key here is that while some of the images carry identifying, machine-readable text or meta information, many do not. Yet the search still found them. How? The answer is that the pictures— more accurately, a pattern in the pictures—was recognized as “Siamese cat” by a machine, without requiring a human to classify each instance.
This is machine learning. At its core, machine learning upends the programming model, forgoing the hard coded “if this, then that” instructions and explicit rules. Instead, it uses an artificial neural network (ANN)—a statistical model directly inspired by biological neural networks—that is “trained” on some data set (the bigger, the better) to accomplish some new task that uses similar but yet unknown data.
The data comes first in machine learning. The system finds its own way, adjusting and refining its model, iteratively.
But back to Siamese cats. Computer vision researchers worked on image recognition for decades, but Google effectively perfected it in months once the company developed a machine-learning algorithm. Today, machine-learning facial recognition systems for mug shots and passport photos outperform human operators.
Not New But Definitely Now
In fact, machine learning, neural networks and pattern recognition aren’t new. In 1950, a computer program was written that improved its checkers performance the more it played (by studying winning strategies and incorporating these into its own program). In 1957, the first neural network for computers (the Perceptron) was designed. In 1967, the “nearest neighbor” algorithm, which allowed a computer to do very basic pattern recognition, was created.
Indeed, some would say that Alan Turing’s famous machine that ultimately broke the German “Enigma” code during World War II was an instance of machine learning—in that it observed incoming data, analyzed it and extracted information.
So why has machine learning exploded on the scene now, pervading fields as diverse as marketing, health care, manufacturing, information security and transportation?
Researchers at Georgia Tech say the explanation is the confluence of three things:
1. Faster, more powerful computer hardware (parallel processors, GPUs, etc.)
2. Software algorithms to take advantage of these computational architectures
3. Loads and loads of data for training (digitized documents, internet social media posts, YouTube videos, GPS coordinates, electronic health records, and, the fastest-growing category, all those networked sensors and processors behind the much-heralded Internet of Things).
This digitalization began in earnest in the 1990s. According to IDC Research, digital data will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42 percent through 2020. In the 2010-20 decade, the world’s data will grow by 50 times, from about one Zettabyte (1ZB) in 2010 to about 50ZB in 2020.
These oceans of data and data sources not only enable machine learning, but also, in a sense, they create an urgent need for it, offering a solution to the human programmer bottleneck. “The usual way of programming computers these days is, you write a program,” says Irfan Essa, director of Tech’s new Center for Machine Learning. “Now we’re saying, that cannot scale.”
There are simply too many data sources, arriving too fast.
The ability of these systems to quickly and reliably make inferences from data has galvanized the attention of the world’s biggest technology players and businesses, who’ve seen the commercial benefits and opportunities.
“It created a disruption,” says Essa, who also serves as associate dean of the College of Computing, a professor in the School of Interactive Computing and an adjunct professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
As Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, put it in his widely circulated April 2017 letter to company shareholders, Amazon’s use of machine learning in its autonomous delivery drones and speech-controlled assistant Alexa is only part of the story.
“Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations and much more,” Bezos wrote. “Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type—quietly but meaningfully improving core operations.”
Two other drivers for the rapid growth of machine learning have been the widely available, open source toolkits (such as Google’s TensorFlow) that can rapidly prototype a machine learning system, and cloud-based storage and computation services to host it.
This April, for instance, Amazon Web Services announced that Amazon Lex, the artificial intelligence service (AI) used to create applications that can interact with users via voice and text—and the technology behind Amazon Alexa—would be available to Amazon Web Services customers.
“You can build a startup very, very fast,” says Sebastian Pokutta, Georgia Tech’s David M. McKenney Family Associate Professor in the H. Milton Stewart School for Industrial and Systems Engineering, and associate director of the Center for Machine Learning (ML@GT). “Before, machine learning was very academic and somewhat esoteric. Now we have a toolbox that I can give a student, and within a week they can create something that’s usable.”
Natural Language: Going Deeper
Like image recognition, speech recognition has seen great strides thanks to machine learning. Consider Amazon’s Alexa or Google Home, two darlings in the speech-controlled appliance space.
Georgia Tech researchers aren’t competing with these new commercial efforts. “We’re working on things that we hope will be important components of systems in the much longer term,” says Jacob Eisenstein, assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing, where he leads the Computational Linguistics Laboratory. “As a field right now, we’re the intersection of machine learning and linguistics.”
That said, Eisenstein points out that Google quietly incorporates increasingly sophisticated natural language processing into its search system every few months.
“What I think they’re doing is drawing ideas from the research literature, from the stuff that’s produced at universities like Georgia Tech,” he says.
Highlighting the market excitement over speech control, Eisenstein notes that five former Tech students are working at Amazon on Alexa development, as are a number of his undergrads and masters students.
So, what sorts of problems are Eisenstein and his colleagues working to solve?
“Imagine you are interested in some new area of research, and could have a system that summarizes the 15 most important papers in that field into a four-page document,” Eisenstein says.
But creating such a system goes far beyond word or phrase recognition. “We know that to understand language, you have to have some understanding of linguistic structure—how sentences are put together,” he explains. Language understanding is hard, from a machine standpoint, because it has very deep, nested structures.
Tackling subjects like language or other complex, non-linear relationships has given rise to a subset of machine learning known as deep learning. A deep neural network is an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers.
Black Box Problems
However, those hidden layers give rise to a black box problem. That is, if the artificial neural network contains hidden layers, its processes aren’t transparent. To take a real-word example: how do we audit the autonomous car’s decision to swerve right, not left?
That’s an area of study for Dhruv Batra, an assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing. His research aims to develop theory, algorithms and implementations for transparent deep neural networks that are able to provide explanations for their predictions, and to study the effect of developed transparent neural networks and explanations on user trust and perceived trustworthiness.
According to Batra: “We have to be a little careful though, because if we tack on the explanatory piece—‘That’s why I’m calling this a cat’—the system may learn to produce an explanation, a post hoc justification that may not have anything to do with its choice.”
Other problems range from the practical, “How can we remove human bias when setting up the algorithm?” to the unexpectedly philosophical, “How can we be sure these systems are, in fact, learning the right things?”
Tech researchers are hard at work on these fascinating questions.
Essa admits there’s a lot of hype around machine learning right now. But he notes that people are very good at overestimating the impact of technology in the short term, yet underestimating it in the long run.
If optical character recognition and, increasingly, speech recognition are taken for granted because they “just work,” there are other technologies that are far from perfect.
“And we’d like them to be perfect, which is why research and development needs to continue,” Essa says.
Machine learning may even play a role in improving how Georgia Tech students are taught in the future.
“At Tech we have a lot of educational data,” he says. “How do we now use that data to learn more about and support our student body—learn more about their learning, and provide the right kinds of guidance and support?”
INSIDE MACHINE LEARNING @ GEORGIA TECH
“At Georgia Tech, we recognize machine learning to be a game-changer not just in computer science, but in a broad range of scientific, engineering, and business disciplines and practices,” writes Irfan Essa, the inaugural director of the Center for Machine Learning at Georgia Tech (ML@GT), in his welcome note on the Center’s web page.
Launched in June 2016, ML@GT is an interdisciplinary research center that combines assets from the College of Computing, the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Its faculty, students and industry partners are working on research and real-world applications of machine learning in a variety of areas, including machine vision, information security, healthcare, logistics and supply chain, finance and education, among others.
The center truly is a collaborative effort across campus, with 125 to 150 Tech faculty involved, and more than 400 students, says Sebastian Pokutta, David M. McKenney Family Associate Professor in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, and an associate director of ML@GT. “Tech has always had a lot of researchers working on machine learning, but they’d been spread out, working in different departments independently,” Pokutta says. “There wasn’t a real community on campus.”
Echoing Essa’s message, Pokutta says the goal of the Center is straightforward and daring: “We want to become the leader in bringing together computing, learning, data and engineering.”
True, there are other machine learning centers in higher ed—MIT, Columbia, Carnegie Mellon—but most focus on combining computing and statistics.
“One of the unique things about Georgia Tech, since we’re a big engineering school, is our machine learning effort is really closely embedded with our engineering units,” Essa says. “We’re close to the sensor, close to the processor, close to the actuator.”
This matters because of what is known as “edge computing”: the concept of moving applications, data and services to the logical extremes of a network, so that knowledge generation can occur at the point of action.
The objective is to use Tech’s engineering prowess—and data-driven techniques—to help design the next generation of technologies and methodologies.
MACHINE LEARNING'S IMPACT ON PRECISION MEDICINE
Healthcare offers a rich source of data to machine learning researchers. There are scanned and electronic health records, claims data, procedure results, lab tests, genetics studies, and even telemetry from devices like heart monitors and wearables like Fitbits and smart watches.
A number of Georgia Tech’s researchers are mining this data to better understand health outcomes at scale and to ultimately figure out the right treatment for each individual patient. This is known as individualist or precision medicine.
Jacob Eisenstein, an assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing, and Jimeng Sun, an associate professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering, are mining the text in electronic health records to better understand health outcomes at scale.
Today, patients and doctors try rounds of treatments for ailments, looking for the best fit. “There’s a lot of trial and error,” Eisenstein explains. The project hopes to reduce that, by systematizing treatment based on a deeper understanding of patients, treatments and outcomes.
Last year, Sun was part of a group of researchers who developed a new, accurate-but-interpretable approach for machine learning in medicine.
Their Reverse Time Attention model (RETAIN) achieves high accuracy while remaining clinically interpretable. It is based on a two-level neural attention model that detects influential past visits and significant clinical variables within those visits (e.g., key diagnoses). RETAIN was tested on a large health system dataset with 14 million visits completed by 263,000 patients over an eight-year period and demonstrated predictive accuracy and computational scalability comparable to state-of-the-art methods such as recurrent neural networks, and ease of interpretability comparable to traditional models (logistic regression).
In other work, Tech professors and students are analyzing data from Geisinger, a hospital network in Pennsylvania, to help predict the risk for sepsis and septic shock in patients before they are admitted to the hospital. Other researchers within the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering’s Health Analytics group are collecting health care utilization data involving millions of individuals for events such as hospitalizations that can be used in estimating the cost savings of preventive care.
PHOTO FINISH: Why Facebook and Amazon Want to “See” Your Images Better
Facebook’s interest in having machines better assess the billions of images uploaded to its platform—in order to describe, rank or even delete objectionable images—is obvious.
Georgia Tech faculty Dhruv Batra and Devi Parikh—married partners both in life and at work—are assistant professors in the College of Computing’s School of Interactive Computing who are currently serving as visiting researchers at Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR).
At Facebook, the duo is working on ways to improve the interaction between human beings, a machine platform and images posted on the social network platform. In April 2016, Facebook began automatically describing the content of photos to blind and visually impaired users. Called “automatic alternative text,” the feature was created by Facebook’s accessibility team. The technology also works for Facebook versions in countries with limited internet speeds or that don’t allow visual content.
And last December, Batra and Parikh also received Amazon Academic Research Awards for a pair of projects they are leading in computer vision and machine learning. They received $100,000 each from Amazon—$80,000 in gift money and $20,000 in Amazon Web Services credit—for projects that aim to produce the next generation of artificial intelligence agents. Batra and Parikh are using giant image data sets with human annotations that have been built up at Mechanical Turk, Amazon’s crowdsourcing internet marketplace.
One project, Visual Dialog, led by Batra, aims at creating an AI agent able to hold a meaningful dialogue with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. Facebook can already generate automatic alternative text for an image, explains Batra. So a user can be told, “This picture may contain a mug, a person, a cat.” The goal, he said, is to go much further—to offer not only more information about the image but also engage the user in a dialog.
Training the machine learning algorithm for the task requires a huge data set—as many as 200,000 conversations on the same set of images, each conversation including 10 rounds of questions and answers (or roughly 2 million question-and-answer pairs).
Another project, titled “Counting Everyday Objects in Everyday Scenes,” is led by Parikh, and aims to enable an AI to count the number of objects belonging to the same category. One particularly interesting approach will try to estimate the counts of objects in one try by just glancing at the image as a whole. This is inspired by “subitizing”—an ability humans inherently possess to see a small number of objects and know how many there are without having to explicitly count.

Georgia Tech Awarded $1.2M NSF Grant to Protect Machine Learning Based Systems from Malicious Attacks
Georgia Tech is leading a $1.2 million project to develop a system to protect the security of machine learning (ML) based systems. School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Assistant Professor Duen Horng (Polo) Chau leads the project, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), alongside Professor Wenke Lee, Associate Professor Le Song, and Assistant Professor Taesoo Kim of Georgia Tech.
From applications in education to science and technology as a whole, the profound reach and use of machine learning is undeniable and ubiquitous. This, in turn, means that any damage caused by ML based systems can be extensive and devastating. Already, attackers can poison ML models by intentionally injecting maliciously crafted training data, causing the model to make wrong decisions. The history of cybersecurity suggests that attackers rendering machine learning based security analysis ineffective by gaining control of the input data or computation procedures will become more prevalent in the real-world soon.
The project team has extensive accomplishments and experience in machine learning, systems and network security, botnet and intrusion detection, and malware analysis. The project itself, titled, SaTC: CORE: Medium: Understanding and Fortifying Machine Learning Based Security Analytics, undertakes the challenge of developing a systematic, foundational, and practical framework to understand attacks, quantify vulnerabilities, and fortify machine learning based security analytics. The ultimate aim of the four-year project is to change how machine learning based systems will be designed, developed, and deployed.
“The ever-increasing volume of data that can be collected and made available for security analysis presents both great opportunities and great challenges. We can now apply powerful data analysis techniques, in particular, machine learning algorithms, that have been developed in recent years to gain new security insights and develop new solutions,” said Chau. “However, preliminary research has demonstrated that by gaining control of the input training data or the classification process, attackers can render machine learning based security analysis ineffective.”
Song explained further, “To determine how adversaries can attack ML based security analytics, we will study the theoretical vulnerabilities of ML algorithms, such as how adversaries may smartly select the most uncertain examples to optimize exploratory attacks, and how they may launch sophisticated causative attacks even when the choices of ML models and algorithms are not known.”
The findings from this research may lead to new kinds of adaptive cyberdefense systems. These systems would be highly resilient and efficient against future cybersecurity attacks, helping protect the nation and its citizens from harm. In a very tangible way, the proposed ideas in this NSF project push forward the envelope of state-of-the-art machine learning research, shaping systems now and into the future.
In 2016, a $1.5 million gift from Intel Corporation was given to Georgia Tech to establish a new research center – the Intel Science & Technology Center for Adversary-Resilient Security Analytics (ISTC-ARSA) – dedicated to the emerging field of ML cybersecurity. The new center focuses on strengthening the analytics behind malware detection and threat analysis. The research exploration with Intel helped the research team identify and formalize important new research questions that form the pillars of this NSF project. These include the crucial need for developing a theoretical machine learning framework to formally quantify the level of impact by different types of attacks, and using this theoretical thinking to guide and increase defender systems in a principled way.
The NSF project will leverage multiple channels to accelerate knowledge dissemination and tech transfer. From Symantec, the leading security solution provider, to various industry partners, the project team has obtained strong commitment to collaborate on the proposed research. Chau explained, “They will share with us malware samples, and help transition the developed research into practice, into their malware analysis engine, via Intel Software Guard Extension. We will open-source all developed software and datasets.”
New Faculty Cohort Joins the College

Computing Power on the ‘Edge’ of the Internet May Help First Responders Communicate Better During Natural Disasters
Storms like Hurricane Irma and other natural disasters bring with them lots of uncertainty: where will they go, how much damage will they cause. What is certain is that no matter where they strike, natural disasters knock out power.
And, no power means no internet for thousands of people in affected areas.
However, Georgia Tech researchers are proposing a new way of gathering and sharing information during natural disasters that does not rely on the internet.
Using computing power built into mobile phones, routers, and other hardware to create a network, emergency managers and first responders will be able to share and act on information gathered from people impacted by hurricanes, tornados, floods, and other disasters.
“Increasingly, data gathered from passive and active sensors that people carry with them, such as their mobile phones, is being used to inform situational awareness in a variety of settings,” said Kishore Ramachandran, a computer science professor at Georgia Tech and lead researcher on the project, which is funded by the National Science Foundation.
“In this way, humans are providing beneficial social sensing services. However, current social sensing services depend on internet connectivity since the services are deployed on central cloud platforms.”
Communicating on the 'Edge'
In a paper presented earlier this year at the 2nd International Workshop on Social Sensing, the Georgia Tech research team detailed how it may be possible to access these centralized services using a decentralized network that leverages the growing amount of computing power at the “edge” of the internet.
This ability will give a huge advantage to first responders.
In a flooded area, for example, search and rescue personnel using a geo-distributed network would be able to continuously ping enabled phones, sensors, and other devices in an area to determine their exact locations. The data is used to create density maps of people in that search region. These maps are then used to prioritize and guide emergency response teams.
The Georgia Tech proposal takes advantage of edge computing. Also known as fog computing, edge computing places more processing capabilities in sensing devices – like surveillance cameras, embedded pavement sensors, and others, as well as in consumer devices like cell phones, readers, and tablets – in order to improve network latency between sensors, apps, and users.
Rather than just being able to communicate through the internet with central cloud platforms, the Georgia Tech team has demonstrated that by harnessing edge computing resources, sensing devices can be enabled to identify and communicate with other sensors in an area.
Decentralizing social sensing services
“We believe fog computing can become a potent enabler of decentralized, local social sensing services that can operate when internet connectivity is constrained,” said Ramachandran.
“This capability will provide first responders and others with the level of situational awareness they need to make effective decisions in emergency situations.”
The team has proposed a generic software architecture for social sensing applications that is capable of exploiting the fog-enabled devices. The design has three components – a central management function that resides in the cloud, a data processing element placed in the fog infrastructure, and a sensing component on the user’s device.
The researchers say that it is not enough to simply run a centralized social sensing service on a number of parallel fog nodes.
“Rather, the social sensing service has to become a distributed service capable of discovering available fog nodes and building a network that aggregates and shares information between social sensors that are connected to different fog nodes,” said computer science Ph.D. student Harshit Gupta.
What's next?
Beyond emergency response during natural disasters, the team believes its proposed fog architecture can also benefit communities with limited or no internet access. These include applications for public transportation management, job recruitment, and housing.
Another possible application of the new approach is monitoring sensing devices in remote areas.
To monitor far-flung devices in areas with no internet access, a bus could be outfitted with fog-enabled sensing capabilities. As it travels in remote areas it would collect data from sensing devices. Once in range of internet connectivity, the “data mule” bus would upload the information to the centralized cloud-based platforms.
“In places that did not benefit from the first wave of cloud-based social sensing services, our hope is that these communities can leapfrog having to rely solely on the internet and directly use fog-based services,” said Ramachandran.
Computing Student Steps Up as SGA Executive Vice President
While many people claim on LinkedIn to be highly motivated, Georgia Tech’s Richard Wang isn’t kidding around.
Along with pursuing a computer science degree with a minor in business and computing through the Stephen A. Denning Technology and Management Program, the fourth-year student works throughout the year as a developer at The Home Depot, and he is active in the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.
Added to this, Wang currently serves as the Student Government Association (SGA) Executive Vice President for Undergraduates.
“The purpose of student government is to represent and serve the needs of the student body,” says Wang. “We want to work together with Georgia Tech administration to provide every student with the best possible Yellow Jacket experience.”
Representing 15,000+ Undergrads
Wang is no stranger to service. In fact, he has been serving in student government since he arrived on campus in 2014. That year, Wang began a two-year stint representing his class in the Undergraduate House of Representatives. He was then elected as Speaker of the House in August 2016.
Wang began his term as SGA executive vice president in April of this year. In this role, he represents more than 15,000 undergraduate students.
“Most people might not know that we have office hours every weekday where students are able to connect with an SGA representative about their questions and concerns,” says Wang.
As for what he’d most like to accomplish during his term as vice president, Wang believes that the SGA could be restructured to better meet students’ needs.
“The current model we follow is outdated and I believe that we can better utilize the talent and passion of our members to create an even better Georgia Tech,” explains Wang.
A Go-Getter for Quite Some Time
Wang says he is motivated in large part by his friends and the Georgia Tech community. But looking back to his high school career, it is obvious that Wang has been a go-getter for quite some time.
As a student at Woodward Academy in College Park, Georgia, Wang excelled in math and science. This, along with excellent classwork and other factors, led to his selection in 2012 as a Young Scholars intern at the University of Georgia’s College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences.
However, not content with academic success alone, Wang was also a member of the school’s wrestling team. He won a state title in the Class AAA wrestling championships in 2013 as a junior.
It was around this time that Wang started to become interested in pursuing a career in computer science. He says that competing on the robotics team in high school “made (him) realize how amazing technology is and how the possibilities are endless.”
With lots of solid leadership experience – and a wealth of computing and business knowledge – Wang plans to pursue these endless possibilities in the workforce following his graduation in the spring of 2019.
“I want to be able to work with emerging technologies as a product or project manager and really push the bounds of what’s possible to help streamline business processes and improve customer service.”

Tech Team Scores Big at NBA Hackathon
On September 23 and 24, the NBA hosted its second annual hackathon at Skylight Modern on 27th Street in New York City. Four Tech students — third-year computer science majors Nikki Cantrell and Mayuri Mamtani and industrial engineering majors Alan Lo and Nishant Reedy — competed in the basketball analytics competition and placed third out of more than 200 participants.
For the students, the road to New York began over the summer.
“I saw something about it on Twitter from one of the basketball writers I follow,” Reddy said. “Then I told Alan about it because I know he’s pretty into basketball analytics. And then he reached out to Nikki and Mayuri because they’re pretty good friends and they’re good with CS.”
#GTComputing Lends a Hand
The NBA would receive 900 applicants, of which, only 207 were accepted. While parts of the application were optional, they were strongly encouraged.
In late August, the group heard back from the NBA that they had been accepted; however, the NBA did not provide travel, so the group asked the College of Computing to sponsor their travel.
After arriving early Friday morning to explore the city, the team began their new project Saturday morning. The team decided to tackle a possible rule change dealing with offensive fouling, specifically dealing with collisions around the restricted area. Currently, the restricted area, designated by a small arc inside the paint, is four feet from the basket. It is restrictive in that no defender can force a charging foul in the area, save for some occasional exceptions.
“What we planned to do was expand that restricted area for three reasons,” Lo said. “First, to decrease the number of injuries that might occur.” More offensive fouls mean more charges being called, which can lead to an increased risk of injury.
“Second,” he continued, “was to improve game watchability, in the sense that nobody wants to watch people drawing charges, that’s really boring. You’d rather watch someone play defense. Third, was to shorten game duration a bit because for people who aren’t as familiar with basketball the game seems kind of long and boring and drawn out.”
The Proof is in the Data
This was particularly apparent to Cantrell and Mamtani, who were not devout fans of the sport.
While the idea was solid on paper, the team needed data to back it up. This data came from the large data pool the NBA had given them a few days before.
“We were given a bunch of data and .csv files,” Cantrell said.
“And we used … play-by-plays of each game since 2007. We did two things with it. First, we went through and parsed the data and looked at the number of offensive fouls per game and the actual time of the game, and we plotted that to show that there was a steady increase in offensive fouls as game time increased.”
With a clear relationship in place, the group needed to show where those fouls were occurring to justify their arguments.
“They gave us .xml files of SportVU data which gives the players’ location in the game every half second,” Cantrell said.
That Foul is Offensive
“We looked at the time the offensive foul occurred and then went into the .xml file and got the location of the player at that instance and then wrote it back to an Excel file so that we could graph that and overlay it on top of a basketball court. That gave us a heat map of where all the offensive fouls occurred.”
Their heat map pointed to almost all offensive fouls occurring just outside the restricted area. They presented their findings in front of a group that included such figures as ESPN writer Zach Lowe, members of senior management for a few NBA teams and FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief, Nate Silver.
“It wasn’t really nerve-racking for [Nikki and Mayuri],” Lo said. “Because they didn’t know anybody. But, it was nerve-racking for [Nishant and me] because we actually knew who we were talking to.”
The third-place finish not only won them a gift card to the NBA Store and merchandise from JBL but also the chance to meet NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, former player Shane Battier, and a host of league insiders. Not bad for a weekend’s work.

New IC Associate Professor Thomas Ploetz Finds Purpose in Machine Learning Research
It was immediately after defending his thesis to earn his Ph.D. from the University of Bielefeld (Germany) that School of Interactive Computing Associate Professor Thomas Ploetz had an epiphany.
In Germany, a dissertation defense is public.
“Public, as in your in-laws could be there,” Ploetz joked. “Mine were.”
His degree was in computer science with a focus on bioinformatics. His mother-in-law prepared herself for his talk by brushing up on her understanding in that subject, as well as sequence analysis and other pertinent topics. Afterwards, she congratulated Ploetz, who had passed, and asked him a question.
“She said, ‘That’s great, now why does it matter what you did? Why is the world a better place now?’ That struck me,” Ploetz said. “Wow, I’ve been doing this for years now and I consider myself as having reached the top, but I could not convey to her, a well-read woman, why what I was doing actually mattered.”
And, so, he began to think. He considered areas of research he was passionate about and, most importantly, how to have a positive impact on society in whatever he came up with.
“I felt like whatever I did must have a purpose. It’s easy to bury yourself in your little corner and work on your problems, but I moved away from that.”
Away from that and toward the health space, where he began applying fundamental research on ubiquitous and wearable computing to analyzing data that could help detect certain conditions.
More than that, though, he attempts to analyze behavior where it happens – in real life, in homes or classrooms, environments in which people actually live rather than lab settings that don’t offer a clear or accurate picture.
“What’s the context? What are the interactions with the environment?” Ploetz explained. “That in itself is a rich source of data, but it’s messy. There’s a lot of noise and ambiguity, which makes it an interesting challenge.”
Ploetz said that the uptick in devices, like phones or wrist watches, that can collect data has provided a great opportunity.
“But they don’t collect information,” he said. “Mining this data with regards to a specific individual to figure out what is going on in their life is the application. Is there something to be concerned about? Is there some sort of disease or condition developing?”
Conditions they are watching for can be anything from autism and Parkinson’s disease to depression, stroke, dementia, or others.
At Georgia Tech, Ploetz said he has a unique opportunity to pursue this agenda with incredible students and faculty collaborators that aren’t easy to find. He first came to Georgia Tech for a brief one-year stint as a visiting research fellow in 2011.
“That got me started thinking about this as a collaborative place,” he said. “I was won over by the environment here.”
He joined the faculty as an associate professor in the School of Interactive Computing earlier this year, and called his experience “fruitful” already.
“The quality of students here is amazing, and that’s not just sweet talk,” he said. “The collaborations with students and faculty provide a fertile environment for intellectual exchange, for pushing boundaries. That’s why I came here.”
Beyond that, he said he has great relationships with external partners like the Marcus Autism Center, Emory University, others in the United Kingdom, where he worked previously.
“It isn’t just folks working parallel – one side work on health and another on computer science,” he said. “It’s two sides working together.
“Without collaboration, there is no research.”

Report Reveals Potential Drawbacks of Growing Demand for CS Education
It’s no secret that the demand for computer science (CS) education is growing.
In fact, according to a new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the number of bachelor’s degrees awarded nationally in computer and information science has increased by 74 percent at not-for-profit institutions since 2009, compared to a 16 percent increase in the number of overall awarded bachelor’s degrees.
The situation at Georgia Tech is similar. Applications for Bachelor’s of Science CS degrees have risen roughly tenfold in the past decade, while overall undergraduate computing enrollment has nearly tripled from 893 total computing students in 2008-09 to more than 2,400 in 2017-18.
“This is something academia has been working to address for some time, but it’s getting to a point now where the rapid increase in demand for CS enrollment is beginning to outpace available resources at many public institutions across the country,” said Executive Associate Dean for the College of Computing Charles Isbell.
Isbell is a member of the National Academies’ Committee on the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments, which authored the report released on October 26.
According to Isbell, the report – titled Assessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments – examines the pros and cons of a number of strategies that have been implemented or that are being considered. One such option is limiting enrollment in CS programs and courses. However, echoing the report Isbell said institutions should carefully consider the consequences before doing so.
“Limiting enrollments may discourage some underrepresented students from participating, and ultimately might force some to abandon the pursuit of their true passion,” said Isbell.
Some of the other strategies that the report considers are the use technology for teaching, adding faculty and academic resources, and even creating new colleges of computer science.
“Every approach has benefits and costs, and leaders will need to select strategies and make trade-offs that are appropriate to their institution’s mission and values,” said committee co-chair Jared Cohon, President Emeritus and University Professor of Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
“We hope our report will be useful as leaders plan for the future role of computer science at institutions of higher learning.”

Two College of Computing Students To Help Develop Interactive Systems for Kendeda Building for Innovative Design
Two College of Computing students are among 10 undergraduates across campus selected as the inaugural (2017-2018) class of Sustainable Undergraduate Research Fellows (SURF).
Computer science major Leo Chen and computational media major Kian Halim, along with their SURF cohorts, will work as paid researchers on the development of the Kendeda Building for Innovative Design.
The new fellows will design and prototype interactive systems that reflect unique elements of the Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable Design. They will also explore how occupants and visitors interact with the building, which is expected to be substantially complete in early 2019.
The fellows represent all six colleges at Georgia Tech and were selected from a group of 88 applicants.
Formerly referred to as the Living Building at Georgia Tech, the Kendeda Building for Innovative Design is on pace to be the first Living Building Challenge 3.1-certified facility of its size and function in the Southeast. The Living Building Challenge is a stringent green building certification program developed and administered by the International Living Future Institute.
First-year Students Battle to Raise Money for Local Charity
A representative from Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) was on campus Nov. 17 to collect a donation being made by first-year College of Computing students.
A check for $350 was presented on behalf of the students and their families to Scott Hodoval, vice president of development for the CHOA Foundation.
“As a nonprofit, we really need the support of the community. These students and their families have done a tremendous job raising money to help the kids at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta,” said Hodoval.
The fundraising kicked off this summer during FASET and ran through the first week of classes. The incoming computer science and computational media students were divided into cohorts that competed in a penny war fundraising campaign, one of many cohort events taking place throughout the academic year.
The teams were raising money for one of four Atlanta-based charities with the winning group selecting the charity that would receive all of the collected funds.
“Since Georgia Tech’s motto is Progress and Service, we wanted these students to focus on giving back to the community,” said Jennifer Whitlow, GT Computing’s director of computing enrollment.
“Because we started during FASET, we had the opportunity to loop in the students’ parents, which added a lot to the fundraising campaign. ”
The check was presented to CHOA by third-year computer science major Rhea Chatterjee. Chatterjee is a CS 1100 teaching assistant and president of Bits of Good, which helped organize the fundraiser.
Bits of Good is a student-run GT Computing organization that connects undergraduate software developers with local Atlanta nonprofits. It’s open to all majors, but members must have some coding experience.
We Can Hack That: Georgia Tech Takes First Place in Hackathon Competition
It’s been a grueling year, but Georgia Tech students have risen to the top of the Major League Hacking (MLH) ranks and have won 1st Place in the recently completed 2017 MLH Hackathon Season.
MLH is an international student hackathon league. Participating in sanctioned events throughout North America, student teams from across campus collectively competed in most of the 190 events held between August 2016 and July 2017. In all, more than 3,000 university and high school students participated in the North American MLH events.
Georgia Tech rose to the top of the MLH standings this season by earning the highest number of merit points and the second-highest number of participation points. Combined, these stats put them ahead of Rutgers University in second place and the University of Waterloo in third place.
Big Prize from Corporate Sponsors
Merit points are earned by submitting winning entries at sanctioned MLH hackathons. Teams are awarded participation points for sending teams to compete in events that require travel.
For the first-place finish, Georgia Tech received the MLH Season Trophy and $50,000 in equipment from competition sponsors Dell and Windows. HackGT – Georgia Tech’s student hackathon and computer science outreach organization – accepted the prizes on behalf of all Georgia Tech’s student hackathon teams.
“Winning the 2017 MLH Hackathon Season award is not solely an ode to the computer science outreach of HackGT, but to all of the Georgia Tech students who excelled at MLH sponsored Hackathons,” said Jordan Madison, HackGT director of communications and third-year computer science major.
Georgia Tech a Rising Star
“With the $50,000 in equipment, we will grow the pool of resources that we provide to our attendees; therefore, giving them more opportunities to bring even more ideas to fruition.”
Georgia Tech’s star has been on the rise in MLH competition. In 2013, Tech ranked 16th. In Spring 2016, teams rose to 6th place before earning the top spot in the 2017 season.
This upward trajectory is in no small part attributable to HackGT. Led by Shehmeer Jiwani (CS ’16) and Pavleen Thukral (CS ’16), Georgia Tech students started attending MLH hackathons around 2013. This resulted in the founding of the HackGT student club in 2014.
“HackGT’s mission is to empower the Georgia Tech community and others to utilize computer science as a tool to bring their ideas to life. Through our events, we give attendees the space and resources needed to achieve this goal and hopefully inspire them to continue to utilize computer science in their perspective fields of study,” said Madison.
The growing interest in hackathons on campus led Jiwani and Thukral to organize Georgia Tech’s first hackathon – known as Hackatech – which has since evolved into HackGT. The organization hosted its fourth hackathon, HackGT, in October. HackGT4: New Heights attracted more than 1,000 hackers from across North America to the three-day event.
College of Computing Taps Grinter for Key Faculty Role
School of Interactive Computing (IC) Professor Beki Grinter has been tapped as the College of Computing’s new Associate Dean for Faculty Development.
In an email sent Dec. 1 to faculty and staff, John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing Zvi Galil congratulated Grinter and said that she will immediately assume the duties of her new collateral position.
“This is a role that has been dormant for a few years, but will be critical as we continue to step up both our faculty recruitment and our efforts to help the College's faculty – both academic and research – progress and grow to become the superstars of tomorrow,” said Galil.
Grinter joined Georgia Tech in 2004 following a number of years in industry research positions, including jobs with Bell Labs and the Palo Alto Research Center. Her research at Tech looks to improve people’s experiences in using existing technology and in creating new technology.
In this pursuit, Grinter and her graduate students have made a number of substantial contributions to the fields of human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and ubiquitous computing.
Positive Signs, But Diversity Still Lagging in AP Computer Science Exam Participation
More than 32 states doubled minority participation and six states doubled female participation in Advanced Placement Computer Science exams in 2017, but according to a new analysis from the Georgia Institute of Technology, more needs to be done to improve outcomes for underrepresented students.
The analysis – released to coincide with National Computer Science Education Week – examines College Board data on 2017 national results of the Advanced Placement Computer Science (AP CS) A exam and the recently introduced AP CS Principles (P) exam.
Increasing female & minority access
According to Barbara Ericson, Georgia Tech research scientist and author of the analysis, the introduction this year of a new AP CS P course and exam contributed to the increases.
“This is exactly what we hoped for. The CS principles course is on par with a college-level intro course for non-CS majors, so it is more accessible to more people,” said Ericson.
Officials had estimated nearly 20,000 AP CS P exams would be taken this year. However, Ericson said the actual number topped 40,000.
“Although overall growth in female and minority participation in the AP CS A exam was relatively flat this year, we’re hopeful that the introduction of the P exam will help swell A exam participation rates in the next few years.”
AP Computer Science A
Despite marginal growth among underrepresented students, overall participation in the AP CS A exam grew by 11.2 percent year-over-year in 2017. A record 60,519 U.S. high school students took the exam with an overall pass rate of 61.8 percent, up more than a percentage point from the previous year.
“It’s great to see growth across the board, but there’s still a long way to go before AP computer science is as available in U.S. classrooms as, say, AP Physics or Calculus,” said Ericson.
More than 170,000 students took the AP Physics 1 exam this year, while more than 316,000 took the AP Calculus AB exam.
Negative stereotypes impacting outcomes
“Increasing the penetration rate for CS is critically important to the U.S. remaining competitive in an international marketplace increasingly reliant on computing and hungry for highly skilled and well-trained computer science talent,” said Ericson.
Despite some positive movement this year, the analysis shows that more needs to be done to improve outcomes for female and underrepresented students. The CS A exam had the lowest participation rate among female students than any other AP exam this year.
The pass rate nationally for women taking the AP CS A exam was 64 percent, which was lower than males by 3.8 percent. The pass rate for African American females was 26.1 percent. In 12 states, no African American females took the exam.
Comprising just 16 percent of all exam takers, the pass rate for underrepresented students was 44 percent.
“Many of these students have less exposure and less confidence in their ability to do computer science,” Ericson said. “They also encounter negative stereotypes about computer science, either people telling them CS is not for them or that CS is boring, antisocial, and doesn’t help anybody.”
AP Computer Science P
In its initial year, 43,780 AP CS Principles exams were given following the 2016 introduction of the new course offering.
Female students represented 30 percent of AP CS P exam takers, while 26 percent were from underrepresented groups, which include American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders. This was the second-highest rate of underrepresented minority participation for all STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) AP exams.
Opportunity to build on success
Overall, the pass rate for the AP CS P exam was 75.1 percent. However, the same disparity that exists between majority and minority outcomes on the AP CS A exam is also evident in the P exam.
The pass rate for women was 70 percent, lower than their male counterparts by 6 percent. At 53 percent, the pass rate for underrepresented students was nearly 30 percent lower than the majority on the CS principles exam.
“The goal of the CS P course is to provide an engaging and rigorous introduction to computer science to a broad diversity of students. While the CS P exam takers are more diverse than those who took the CS A exam, the percentage of females is still low and under-represented students have a lower pass rate on both exams," said Ericson.
“More work needs to be done to recruit and support females and minorities in computer science. Hopefully, as a nation, we can build on the initial success of CS P to truly offer computer science for all students.”
Georgia Tech Launches Constellations Center Aimed at Equity in Computing
Georgia Tech’s College of Computing has launched the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing with the goal of democratizing computer science education. The mission of the new center is to ensure that all students—especially students of color, women, and others underserved in K-12 and post-secondary institutions—have access to quality computer science education, a fundamental life skill in the 21st century.
Constellations is dedicated to challenging and improving the national computer science (CS) educational ecosystem through the provision of curricular content, educational policy assessment, and development of strategic institutional partnerships. According to Senior Director Kamau Bobb, democratizing computing requires a “real reckoning with the race and class divisions of contemporary American life.”
Building Equitable Infrastructure
The central challenge facing the United States in computing education is that there simply are not enough K-12 teachers or university faculty at any level to meet the demand of students or the needs of industry. In Georgia, there are approximately 519,000 high school students. In the 2016-17 school year less than 10 percent, only 43,000 students, enrolled in CS courses of any kind. Of the approximately 600 teachers instructing those students, only 33 of them were certified by the state professional standards commission.
However, like any limited and valuable commodity in American life, access is strongly correlated with race, class, and privilege. Black students, for example, comprise 13 percent of all students taking CS courses, even though they represent 37 percent of all public high school students in the state. This pattern is replicated in many states across the country.
“We’re trying to build an equitable infrastructure for CS education within a national educational system that is tragically inequitable. We see this as an issue of educational justice,” said Bobb, who comes to Georgia Tech from the National Science Foundation (NSF), where he served as a program officer in NSF’s Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering.
“As computing emerges from under the STEM umbrella as a national priority and a pathway to power and social mobility in America, there is a tremendous amount of collaboration, development, and advocacy to do. Georgia Tech is putting the full weight of its research capacity and programmatic innovation into this effort.”
Computing Skills Critical to Everyone
Bobb is joined at Constellations by Lien Diaz, who serves as director of educational innovation and leadership. Diaz previously was with The College Board as director of curriculum, instruction, and assessment. In a partnership with the NSF, she led the development of the new Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles course that launched in the fall of 2016.
“For decades now, computing fields have lacked female representation and racial diversity in the workforce,” Diaz said. “When I was at AP, the goals behind developing CS Principles are quite similar to what we’re trying to do at Constellations: We want to show how relevant computing is, no matter where you live, or what your gender or the color of your skin is. We want to dispel the myth that computing is only for a certain population. It’s for everyone, and computing skills will be too critical to everyone in our future society for us to simply accept the current disparities in access to computing education.”
Time of Reckoning for Industry
Constellations comes at a critical time, as the technology industry is being forced to reckon with calls for equity as never before. Like Diaz, Bobb brings critical experience in addressing these very issues. In his role at NSF, he helped construct a national research agenda intended to accomplish many of Constellations major goals, which include:
- Intentionally addressing issues of race and class that directly affect student achievement in computing;
- Moving beyond traditional brick and mortar constraints of educational spaces;
- Addressing the limitations of the national teacher corps through innovative human-technical solutions and the coordination of formal and informal learning.
- With initial funding both from the Institute and private philanthropy, Constellations is taking a comprehensive approach. Constellations sits in the College of Computing but will work with multiple units across the Institute with a shared goal of addressing the many layers of equity in computing.
“The lack of diversity in computing is well-documented and represents a real threat to the nation’s political, economic, and cultural standing in the world,” said Charles Isbell, executive associate dean in the College of Computing.
“Many university faculty members have devoted their research energy to understanding the most effective methods for computing education and increasing access for all students. The College’s ongoing work to offer Georgia Tech CS courses and support to Atlanta Public Schools (APS) and other districts across the state has deepened our grass-roots understanding of the barriers to equity.”
That ongoing work with APS is just one of the reasons why Georgia Tech provides the perfect home for Constellations. College of Computing faculty members Betsy DiSalvo, Barb Ericson, and Mark Guzdial are nationally recognized leaders in the study and design of effective CS educational programs and the systemic barriers to equity in CS education. The College itself, through its Office of Outreach, Enrollment, and Community and the work of Assistant Dean Cedric Stallworth, has a long history of computing outreach and teacher-training programs.
“The Constellations Center aims to highlight Atlanta’s diverse communities, promote the concealed talent that exists to contribute to a growing technology-driven workforce, and diminish racial and gender divides in American social and tech spaces,” Bobb said. “Computing is not just a matter of education, it is an element of a fair and just democracy.”
Legendary GT Computing Instructor Bill Leahy Retires
Director of the Division of Computing Instruction (DCI) and Senior Lecturer Bill Leahy is retiring this month, closing a career that began as a College of Computing graduate student teaching assistant in 1998.
For thousands of CS majors over the past two decades, Leahy has been the face of GT Computing. His sense of humor, his knowledge, and his passion for teaching computer science have all had a lasting impact on majors and non-majors alike.
“Bill is very much loved by the student community. Over the past 20 years, whenever I meet alumni, more often than not, his name comes up,” said College of Computing Dean Zvi Galil. “They always tell me that their favorite instructor was Bill Leahy.”
Although he’s loved and admired now for his wit and ease in the classroom, Leahy was a bit stiff when he began teaching introductory computer science (CS) at the College in January 2000.
“It may be hard to believe, but I have a bit of stage fright. So, I would walk into class with a set of PowerPoint slides, and that was the script,” said Leahy. “That is what I was going to present. It was all sort of rehearsed.”
The power of improv
His approach changed when one of his daughters started acting with the well-known Atlanta improv company, Dad’s Garage. Through what Leahy referred to as “a series of weird events,” he started doing lighting for shows at Dad’s.
One evening a friend suggested that Leahy should take an improv class for kicks. One class led to several more, both at Dad’s Garage and elsewhere in Atlanta. Everything changed from there.
“I can’t tell you how much improv helped me in the classroom,” said Leahy. “I can’t say it enough that, if you’re a teacher, you should take an improv class.”
Along with using improv exercises to “wake up” sleepy undergraduates, Leahy’s new skills allowed him to relax in the classroom and engage with his students in more meaningful ways.
“I would go into class and stuff would just pop into my mind. I don’t know where it comes from,” he explained. “The other day in a class, talking about C programming, I said, ‘Nobody came down from the mountain and gave Moses the laws of C programming. I know because I was there!’”
Letting students in on a secret
Along with providing him a more stream-of-consciousness approach in the classroom, working at Dad’s Garage and on plays around the city helped Leahy realize just how important storytelling is.
“I try to make my lectures a story,” he explained. “‘Here’s a situation and a problem people faced, and here’s how they solved it.’ I was surprised at first, but the students responded very positively. I think they like the presentation like they’ve just heard this cool story and they’re in on a secret.”
To say that students have responded well to Leahy’s approach over the years is an understatement.
In fact, many undergraduates claim Leahy as their favorite teacher at Georgia Tech, citing his humor and patience as inspiring them to either pursue a minor in CS or to switch majors altogether. Many more developed strong emotional bonds with him.
This last sentiment is probably best captured by a student posting to a popular professor rating site, who wrote, “I’m a grown-ass man and I haven’t cried in years, but realizing I was done with Bill’s class made me curl up in the fetal position and cry a river.”
“You know, it’s not like we’re teaching them how to disarm a bomb, where if they cut the blue wire the thing will explode,” said Leahy. “There’s no need for it not to be fun. When you really love what you’re doing, you try to find ways to do it that people like.”
Early experience comes in handy
Prior to his career at Georgia Tech, Leahy was finding ways to teach and inspire his coworkers at Corning, the longstanding U.S. manufacturing company.
With B.S. and M.S. degrees in ceramics engineering from Virginia Tech, Leahy began his career with Corning in 1973 as a product engineer in the television products division, making TV tubes for RCA, Zenith, Philips, and other manufacturers.
It was around this time that the company introduced a new management software system that no one could figure out how to use. No one except Leahy.
“I had always been interested in computers and I started out in electrical engineering at Virginia Tech, so I had some programming experience and background,” said Leahy.
Before long, Leahy was training employees how to use the new system and writing the training protocols the company would use to train others. “Anytime I had a chance to teach I would take it, so anytime there was new tech to be introduced, I was involved in the training rollout.”
After a series of promotions in different divisions at Corning from lead control engineer to lead process engineer to plant chief engineer, Leahy’s division was sold to a French company.
Bon voyage
At this point, Leahy had the opportunity to take a job in France. He jumped at the chance and spent four years living and working abroad, picking up fluent French along the way.
Following his stint in France, Bill returned to the U.S. corporate office. Not long after, he saw a flyer advertising a plant manager’s position to oversee construction of a new manufacturing plant in the Southeast.
“The sign said you had to have manufacturing experience and you had to have something else that I don’t remember, and it said you had to be able to speak French. I looked at this and thought, ‘I’m the only person in the entire company that meets these requirements,” said Bill.
Bill got the job and moved his family to Georgia. In his new role, Leahy was the lead in a $50 million gas furnace plant in Covington that manufactures perfume and cosmetic bottles.
“They wanted an American to build the plant and someone French to run it. There were jobs in Massachusetts and New Jersey, but at this point, I was ready for something different. My wife said, ‘Why don’t you do something fun?”
Looking for a new direction
Leahy had always enjoyed working with computers, but he felt that he didn’t have the right degree or job experience to switch careers.
“So I thought, if I go back to school for a master’s degree, then I’d be exposed to the job market and I could network and meet people, and I could find a job and have a wonderful time.”
He went for it.
A Georgia Tech alum and friend of Leahy’s working with oilfield services company Schlumberger suggested that he call Peter Freeman, then-dean of the College of Computing.
“I call and get the person whose job it was to keep people from talking to Peter Freeman. I said, ‘My friend from Schlumberger said I should call…’ Immediately, I was put on the phone with Peter Freeman who told me to come down to campus,” said Leahy.
Turns out, Schlumberger is a friend of the College. “I came down and met with a few folks, and next thing I knew I was enrolled in the College.”
Leahy started his M.S. program in January of 1998 taking CS1, was hired as a paid TA shortly thereafter, and the rest, as they say, is history.
Evolving GT Computing
Perhaps one of the biggest changes during Leahy’s time at the College was the launch of its three schools and the introduction of the Threads curriculum about a decade ago.
With students moving on different tracks and professors now attached to the schools, the College also moved at this time to recognize the importance of the foundational work Leahy and his fellow lecturers and instructors were doing.
So, what started as the Foundations Group was soon elevated and became the Division of Computing Instruction in 2012. “At the time, we were an amorphous collective of people, non-tenure faculty mostly with industry backgrounds, that just wanted to teach,” said Lecturer David Smith.
“Since Bill took the helm he has been our voice and our advocate with the College administration and the Institute,” said Smith who was also one of Leahy’s original instructors during his M.S. program.
Another big change he has seen is the mainstreaming of computer science.
“With so many more people being interested in CS, we’ve had to go through an exercise of, how do we handle very large classes with many, many students, but we’re figuring it out and maintaining very high standards along the way.”
For Leahy, leveraging technology is the way to go.
“One of my former students – now an Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) student – was so excited when she told me, ‘The ability to rewind five minutes on a lecture is the most incredible thing.’
This ability for students to watch lectures at their own pace is a game-changer, as far as Leahy is concerned. “The time you free-up, you can spend with students in person or via some online tool, where they can ask individual questions and get individual answers.”
“I’m not suggesting we need to put everyone in the same box. If someone prefers lectures, then we need to have lectures, but there are lots of opportunities to do cool stuff and find innovative ways to reduce class sizes. We need to embrace technology and be leaders, not followers,” said Leahy.
Saying goodbye
Like many, deciding to retire was not an easy decision for Leahy. “The College of Computing is such a wonderful place with just the best people and the best community, so it was a really tough decision for me to make, but I’m ready to go and looking forward to what comes next!”
Leahy has a lot to keep him busy once he closes his laptop for good this semester. He plans to stay active in Dad’s Garage, spend more time working with his railroad club, and travel more with his wife visiting friends and family across the country. And he hasn’t ruled out brushing up on his French for another visit to France.
Leahy’s retirement celebration is set for Dec. 13, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the Klaus Atrium. RSVPs are required and costumes are encouraged!
Georgia Tech Researchers Awarded $7.5 Million from Office of Naval Research for Secure Stack
A team of Georgia Tech researchers from the School of Computer Science (SCS) has been awarded $7.5 million from the Office of Naval Research to develop a customized attack-resistant software stack.
SCS Assistant Professor Bill Harris is the principal investigator on the project and is collaborating with Professors Wenke Lee and Alessandro Orso, Associate Professor Santosh Pande, and Assistant Professor Taesoo Kim.
The researchers are working on a technique for reducing what’s known as the attack surface, the total number of ways in which a program can be vulnerable to exploit. Most general-purpose software includes code that not every user needs and unused code can create exploit opportunities for attackers. Through this research, users will be able to run software in which unneeded code is removed, thus decreasing the vulnerability of the programs they use.
Lee compares the project to a house. “When you build a house, you only really need one door, but the house may still have multiple doors. The number of doors increases the opportunity to break in,” Lee said. “If you only have one door, your house is more secure.”
In order to do this, the researchers are looking at the full stack of software systems, including applications, operating systems, and possibly Internet of Things devices. They are planning to use static and dynamic analysis techniques to determine which pathways through the system different users need. Each researcher has a specific area of expertise:
- Pande’s focus on compilers will help determine what essential code must be loaded for each user during application execution.
- Harris’s expertise with static analysis will provide guarantees that the software maintains its integrity despite removed code.
- Orso will use dynamic analysis and testing techniques to confirm the modified system still functions as expected.
- Kim will use his expertise in systems to determine which modules can be removed from the operating system without compromising its functionality.
- Lee will focus on the aspects related to security and use his expertise to analyze and experiment with malware.
Overall, the five researchers have the set of complementary skills needed for the project to be successful. Over the five-year life of the grant, the researchers expect to develop a series of approaches for reducing attack surface that anyone can use on complex systems, as well as on low-level code.
“Going back to the house metaphor, the problem is that different people want to use different doors,” Orso says. “Our research will allow users to customize the house for each person so that it contains only the door that person needs.”
Professor Margaret Martonosi Delivers Mary Jean Harrold Memorial Distinguished Lecture
Professor Margaret Martonosi gave the Mary Jean Harrold Memorial Distinguished Lecture on Friday, Jan. 12. It was standing room only for the Princeton computer science professor’s talk, A “Post-ISA” Era in Computer Systems: Challenges and Opportunities.
The lecture is named after former School of Computer Science Professor Mary Jean Harrold, who was a leading software engineer. Martonosi worked with Harrold at the Computing Research Association–Women, a division of the CRA that focuses on bringing more women to computing research. “Mary Jean was simultaneously very tough but very nice,” Martonosi said. “Balancing that is a life-long challenge for most of us, but she did it masterfully.”
The renowned computer architect discussed the future of computing in this post-Moore’s law era. In 1965, businessman Gordon Moore posited that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles almost every two years. Computer trends have been dictated by this ever since, yet as transistors shrink so does their efficiency. Almost a decade later, electrical engineer Robert Dennard introduced Dennard scaling, or the idea that even as transistors get smaller, their power density remains consistent.
Yet today we can only drop supply voltage so much. The future of hardware is devoted to figuring out what comes after Moore and Dennard are obsolete, and computer architects are some of the chief researchers trying to discover the next phase.
“Computer architects mediate between application trends from one side and technology trends from the other,” Martonosi said. “Some technology trends are challenges like the end of Moore’s law and Dennard scaling, and some are opportunities like technologies that might be emerging. Application trends are also guiding much of what architecture does, so coming up with accelerators and ways of better supporting big data and machine learning.”
These opportunities were the focus of Martonosi’s talk. She detailed the history of attempts to solve this dilemma, such as per module approaches (not powering what a programmer isn’t using) or on-chip parallelism (spreading out operations through multiple processors). Yet these fixes could only go so far. Now the field is focused on heterogeneity and specialization, such as using accelerators or putting central processing units and graphics processing units on the same chip.
“What’s interesting about this is not just the degree of resourcefulness employed to keep scaling performance at manageable power,” Martonosi said. “The interesting thing —and perhaps the scary thing about it — is that over time more and more of this became exposed to software. Whether you’re architects or if you sit higher in the food chain, we’re all in this together.”
There may be more complexity now, but with that comes more bugs and more security risks. “This is a fundamentally disruptive moment, not just for architects but for computer systems overall because the hardware-software interface is undergoing a seismic change,” Martonosi said.
She outlined the challenges in this new era:
- How to program these heterogeneous systems in a way that’s correct
- How to verify that correctness
- How long will this method be sustainable
Ultimately, Martonosi argued, we need new software abstractions to mitigate the problem in the short and long term. For the short term, Martonosi’s research is focusing on memory consistency models and how to verify them. These models guarantee that memory will be consistent if the programmer follows a systems’ rules. Her team has created several verification tools that have found bugs. One such tool, known as TriCheck, is a full stack memory consistency model verification tool that can analyze everything from high-level languages to microarchitectures.
“Architects can have a lot of leverage if they verify things earlier,” Martonosi said.
Yet Martonosi believes the long-term solution could be quantum computing. It may be too specialized to take over completely for Moore’s law, but it is the new paradigm. As researchers find faster quantum algorithms that need fewer qubits, the basic unit of quantum information, and improve reliability, this could translate to scaling improvements.
“I see this as the golden age of computer systems design,” Martonosi said. “The rules are ready to be broken.”
ML@GT Receives $500,000 Gift From Facebook
Facebook has provided a gift of $500,000 to the newly formed Center for Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT), which will be split evenly over two years.
These funds will support research efforts in artificial intelligence and a variety of ML@GT’s activities. Facilitated by School of Interactive Computing Assistant Professors Devi Parikh, Dhruv Batra, and Professor Irfan Essa, this two-year gift is a step toward Facebook’s longer-term commitment to strengthening relationships and collaborations with Georgia Tech.
Both Batra and Parikh are research scientists at Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR).
“Besides activities at the center, some of the funds will go to support Devi Parikh and Dhruv Batra’s research and to provide fellowships for our machine learning Ph.D. students,” Essa said. “We appreciate the efforts of Devi and Dhruv in helping to bring Facebook in to support our center.”
Essa added that speakers from Facebook have already come to Georgia Tech to give talks in the past, and, thanks to the increased connection between the two units, he hopes to increase such interactions moving forward.
Facebook is expected to increase its presence in Georgia in the near future, according to a report in the Atlanta Business Chronicle on Tuesday. The report noted that Facebook would build a 400-acre data center at a business park near Social Circle, Ga. The expectation is that Facebook will make a $20 billion investment over several years, and the project could create about 250 jobs.

Leahy, Foley Awarded with Emeritus Status
For the first time in its history, Georgia Tech has awarded a non-tenured faculty member with the distinguished title of emeritus.
The College of Computing’s William “Bill” Leahy was bestowed with the title of Senior Lecturer Emeritus on Jan. 12, following his retirement at the end of the Fall 2017 semester.
“This is an unprecedented honor and is more than fitting for someone who so strongly taught and influenced a generation of Georgia Tech computing students,” said Dean of Computing Zvi Galil in an email to faculty and staff.
Along with the new emeritus designation, Leahy’s lasting impact is being recognized with an award in his name. Beginning this year, the College’s best lecturer award will be known as the William “Bill” Leahy Best Lecturer Award.
“Being named Tech's first Senior Lecturer Emeritus and having the annual best lecturer award named after me were the best kind of gifts–total surprises!” said Leahy.
“And, to be honest, I still can't quite believe it!”
In the same email, Galil announced that Jim Foley has been elevated to Professor Emeritus. The honor recognizes Foley’s distinguished career at Georgia Tech, which began in 1991.
“What a tremendous honor,” said Foley. “Very few have the opportunity to be part of an academic enterprise that in 25 years rises from being ranked in the top 40 to being ranked in the top 10. I’m proud of what so many of us, working together, have accomplished.”
Also recently retired, Foley served as Stephen Fleming Chair of Telecommunications in the School of Interactive Communications. Foley is widely recognized as an early influential leader human-computer interaction and computer graphics.
Flashpoint’s Innovation for All Conference Shows the Success of the Startup Engineering Program
Flashpoint is more than just a center for startup engineering. It’s a place that changes mindsets and the future of companies. This was the common theme at its 2018 Innovation for All Conference & Cohort 8 Demo Day on Jan. 23.
Entrepreneurs, investors, students, and professors filled the auditorium of the Historic Academy of Medicine. The afternoon included panels, demo day presentations, and a keynote from Flashpoint Director and Founder Merrick Furst.
Furst, a Distinguished Professor in the School of Computer Science, presented what he called “the trillion-dollar opportunity.” Startups should no longer be asking how to innovate but how to innovate in a more deliberate way.
“Imagine someone saying, ‘We invested in that idea because the team has the competence to innovate,’” Furst said. But how do you determine who is competent at innovation?
There are three types of innovation, according to Furst:
- Informative, where companies get better at becoming themselves or doing what they already do
- Transformative, where companies change what they are or pivot
- Formative, where companies change their form
The third type of innovation is the most significant yet also the hardest to accomplish. “Because we don’t notice that we’re wrong, we don’t do anything about it,” Furst said. “The single biggest problem we have when trying to do innovation is people are fundamentally indifferent to us.”
The key to having a successful startup then is finding what Furst calls “the nonindifference,” or what is something people have an authentic demand for. This is what Flashpoint teaches its cohorts. Yet it’s not as easy as anticipating customers’ needs; it’s a fundamental shift in how the company thinks.
“We live in our own blind spots, but we can’t just tell people they are in blind spots,” Furst said. “We have to provide a process to get out of the blind spots.”
Part of getting out of that blind spot is realizing customers are often just as immune to change as the company is. “You need to see customers for who they cannot avoid being to map their immunities to change,” Furst said. “That way you can adopt a deliberate innovation mindset that enables customers to be more themselves.”
This is the Flashpoint process, and it has been a wide success. Since 2012, Flashpoint has worked with more than 150 startups with a market value of roughly $1.2 billion. Yet the success is more than just a number as various startup directors and Flashpoint alumni said during the first two panels, led by Professor Richard DeMillo.
Andres Garcia, chief technology officer of Florence Healthcare, said Flashpoint fundamentally changed how they operated.
“Before we started Flashpoint, the company was just three guys in a small office trying to figure something out. I’m a technical person, so I was trying to build something,” Garcia said. “When we got to Flashpoint, they said, ‘You shouldn’t be writing code; you should figure things out first.’ It forced me to talk to customers. Right from the start, Flashpoint changed the way we do things.”
Flashpoint is so embedded in a company’s DNA that even people who didn’t go through the program benefit from it. When Robin Gregg became CEO of RoadSync, a Flashpoint alum, she discovered just how much Flashpoint’s drive for honest dialogue impacted her team.
“We have a firm commitment to being very honest about what we’re thinking and making sure we weren’t lying to ourselves,” Gregg said. “Some of the things that went most poorly were most informative—to us, to our strategy, to me as a leader.”
Yet Flashpoint doesn’t just help startups. Corporations, from Coca-Cola to Mercedes-Benz, have sent employees to learn how to innovate. Several Tech professors have been better able to understand their colleagues thanks to the program.
“The academic world has come up with fantastic ideas of how to get better at helping students learn, yet when we bring this to our colleagues and universities across the country, we’re met with resounding indifference,” said School of Physics Professor Michael Schatz. “Flashpoint has been really unlocking more insight into why our colleagues make the certain choices that they do.”
One of the key things all panelists noted was how Flashpoint made failure constructive.
“Most cultures don’t have an environment that accepts and embraces failure,” said Beverly Seay, chair of the College of Computing’s Advisory Board. “With the Flashpoint approach, it’s okay to take risks. They offer you that chance early before you spend millions.”
The afternoon concluded with demo day presentations from 16 teams from Flashpoint’s Cohort 8.
The Flashpoint process clearly has had an impact across all sectors because it’s not just about startups, as Furst noted.
“Deliberate innovations matter not just for startups, but large innovations as well.”
Stanford CS Chair Talks Programming Models with Packed House
Professor Alex Aiken delivered a School of Computer Science Distinguished Lecture on Wednesday, Jan. 31. His talk on programming models for large-scale parallel machines, Legion — Programming Heterogeneous, Distributed Parallel Machine, packed the auditorium in the Klaus Advanced Computing Building.
Aiken is the chair of computer science at Stanford and an ACM fellow. His research focuses on programming languages. The talk highlighted a new parallel programming system, known as Legion, which works on heterogeneous, hierarchical, and distributed parallel machines.
Legion is relevant in this world of supercomputers that require a lot of heterogeneity to function. A supercomputer can include central processing units (CPU), graphics processing units (GPU), field programming gate arrays, and more — all with different memory sizes and speeds. Yet, because latency – the delay between instructions for data transfer and the transfer itself –is fixed in these systems, the power of computation is often faster than the ability to move data around. This can make it difficult to effectively program these high-end machines.
The three primary goals in programming the current generation of supercomputers are:
- High performance
- Performance portability
- Programmability
Although these goals can be met today, they come at a great cost. It can take a decade of software investment to develop one application, yet the machines change every three to four years. Currently, it is the programmer’s responsibility to keep up with what can often be tedious and time-consuming work.
“The real problem is not describing the parallelism; the problem is really the data and the movement of the data within these machines,” Aiken said.
The goal of Legion is to shift some of this responsibility on to the programming system. When the organization of a program’s data is easily matched to a machine’s memory, it helps meet these performance goals.
Legion is a programming model and runtime system that describes hierarchical organizations for data and computation at an abstract level. A separate mapping interface lets programmers control how data and computation are placed onto the memories and processors of a machine.
The results are effective. According to Aiken, Legion is competitive on a single graph, runs 20 times faster on GPUs, and is much faster than CPU systems.
“You get a win on every single network we’ve tried just by doing partitioning and networking in a different way than is currently represented on other systems,” Aiken said.
The new programming model is already being used in the fields of chemistry and physics to model chemical reactions.
Ultimately, Aiken presents a new way of looking at programming. If a programmer is willing to put in the effort to organize data up front, it will approve efficiency overall. “It’s all about program productivity. How much effort are you willing to expend to get the desired level of performance?” Aiken said
School of Computer Science Students Dominate at IEEEXtreme
They had 30 problems, 24 hours, and a lot of Coca-Cola. Yet three College of Computing students not only survived the IEEEXtreme online programming competition on Oct. 14, 2017, they came in third internationally out of more than 3,000 teams worldwide.
“Team GT” included School of Computer Science Ph.D. students Majid Farhadi and Yu Gao, and CS undergraduate Animesh Fatehpuria. All are competitive programmers who have placed well in previous competitions. Farhadi’s past IEEEXtreme team came in first in 2015. Fatehpuria won second in last year’s CodeCon.
Despite their prior success, the hackathon was still a challenge for these veterans. Every hour multiple programming problems were released for 24 hours straight. Participants gain points not just for solving the problem correctly, but also for the speed and complexity of their solution.
The winner can be determined by a mere second. In the 2017 competition, the top 11 teams all solved the problems accurately, so ties were broken by time penalties.
But for Team GT, it’s not all about winning.
“We enjoy solving problems,” Farhadi said. “This helps students to practice and improve their skills.”
He hopes more students will participate in this year’s challenge. As long as students can analyze a problem, devise algorithms to solve it, and program, they can compete with the best of them.
Companies Battle for GT Computing Students at Spring Career Fair
The fierce competition between top global brands spilled out of the marketplace and onto campus recently as scores of companies gathered to vie for GT Computing’s best and brightest students.
The Spring 2018 College of Computing Career Fair was held from Jan. 30 to Feb. 1 in the Klaus Advanced Computing Building Atrium. Recruiters from Citi Technologies, Northrop Grumman, Google, and other top global companies met face-to-face with thousands of GT Computing students and others from across campus.
The College hosts two undergraduate career fairs each academic year. The fall and spring semester events, organized by the College’s Office of Outreach, Enrollment, and Community, are opportunities for students to build professional networks, sharpen interviewing skills, and get a sense of the job market they’ll enter after graduation.
If last year is any indication, the job market for these soon-to-be grads is looking good. The College’s Spring 2017 graduating class had a job offer rate of 91.4 percent and a median starting salary of $86,500.
More than 1,000 students attended each day of the three-day career fair. A gallery of photos from the Career Fair is available online.
School of Computer Science Professor Dana Randall Delivers Invited Address at Joint Mathematics Meetings
Mathematics is embracing theoretical computer science. This year’s Joint Mathematics Meetings showcased the field with awards and talks, including one from School of Computer Science Professor Dana Randall.
Randall was greatly honored to be invited to give this talk, her second invited address at the annual math conference, which more than 6,000 people attended in January.
“In addition, theoretical computer science was really well represented among speakers,” Randall said. “There’s now a broader interest in our field. It really is remarkable because last year there wasn’t anyone.”
Randall also hosted a special session with Arizona State’s Professor Andrea Richa on emergent phenomena in discrete models. Emergent phenomena are phase transitions, or a microscopic change in a parameter that creates a macroscopic change to a system, such as water to ice or unmagnetized to magnetized.
Sampling algorithms used in random generation also experience phase transitions. When some parameter of the system is modified, they can change abruptly from being efficient to inefficient. In effect, the algorithm breaks down.
Understanding the limitations of some sampling algorithms can lead theoretical computer scientists to find alternative faster algorithms. One path forward is harnessing these emerging phenomena to an advantage through distributed algorithms, or algorithms that do not have a central coordinator and run on distributed systems.
Randall, Richa, and School of Physics Associate Professor Daniel Goldman have been exploring this through programming smarticles, or tiny robots that cannot function well on their own but can accomplish tasks collectively.
“Each particle has local rules but no global puppeteer, but interesting collective behavior can happen by using emergent phenomena,” Randall said.
If a smarticle is put on a table, it will wiggle its arms around but stay still, but if a few are placed together, they start jostling and then move as a swarm. In effect, the smarticles are responding to their environment and adjusting parameters accordingly, which can change the phase of the entire system.
The researchers are trying to understand what are the minimal computational requirements to achieve compression. Then they determine if the collective behavior can become more sophisticated and complicated. To do so, they are building a simple distributed algorithm that exhibits this complicated behavior.
The possibilities of emergent phenomena were explored during the session. Theoretical computer scientists applied the concept to DNA, neural algorithms, graph coloring, and more.
Theoretical computer science is finding more connections everywhere, and it’s especially nice to see it highlighted at a big math conference.
Isbell Testifies at House Subcommittee Hearing on Artificial Intelligence
This Valentine’s Day, Charles Isbell, executive associate dean and professor in Georgia Tech’s College of Computing, took the stand in Washington to testify before the House Oversight Committee’s Subcommittee on Information Technology about the national and global impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
“I am excited by these hearings,” said Isbell in his testimony. “Advances in AI are central to our economic and social future.”
Isbell – an affiliated faculty member with The Center for Machine Learning at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) – was invited to present committee members with testimony on the “game-changing” nature of AI and to explore the potential impact of additional industry regulation.
Transforming the World
The committee requested that Isbell – along with expert witnesses from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Intel, and Nvidia – unpack the “potential for artificial intelligence and machine learning to transform the world around us and how we might collectively best respond to its potential.”
“By leveraging computing and data, we are moving from robots that assemble our cars to cars that almost drive themselves,” said Isbell. “One can be skeptical – as I am – that we will in the near future create AI that is as capable as humans are in performing a wide variety of the sort of general tasks that humans grapple with every day, simultaneously.
"But it does seem that we are making strong progress toward being able to solve a lot of very hard individual tasks as well as humans. We may not replace all three million truck drivers and taxi cab drivers, nor all three million cashiers in the United States, but we will increasingly replace many of them. We may soon trust the x-ray machine itself to tell us if we have a tumor, as much as we trust a doctor. We may not automate away intelligence analysts, but AI will shape and change their analyses.”
Machines Making Decisions With Humans
The ML@GT research center is a key player in the type of interdisciplinary exploration required to apply machine learning to the kinds of autonomous systems (like self-driving cars and manufacturing robots) explored in the Oversight Committee hearing. It is also pushing forward on less obvious applications such as health care, data analytics and data mining, and applications in biology, economics and finance, and social networks.
Isbell noted in his testimony the importance of transparency in algorithm development and the creation of machines that “make decisions with humans” to help us accomplish tasks more effectively. He also stressed that, in order to both help people collaborate more efficiently with AI assistance and enable better human oversight, education will play a larger role in a technologically assisted future.
“To understand such machines, much less create them, we should strive for citizens to not only be literate but to be computer literate; that is, they must understand computing and computational thinking and how it fits into problem-solving.”
Supporting the Educational Pipeline
Isbell is also one of the minds behind Georgia Tech’s new Constellations Center for Equity in Computing, a center based in the College of Computing and serving as a hub for research and advocacy at the intersection of educational equity and computing. Accordingly, Isbell’s testimony stressed the equally significant roles of education and research in the future of the burgeoning fields of machine learning and AI.
“The issues that are being raised here can be addressed with thoughtful support for robust funding in basic research in artificial intelligence—including research in how to engage in education; support for that education throughout the pipeline from K-12 and beyond, including post-graduate retraining; and in developing standards for the proper use of intelligent systems,” said Isbell.
Additional invited expert witnesses for the House Oversight Committee included Oren Etzioni from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Amir Khosrowshahi from Intel, and Ian Buck from NVIDIA.

Georgia Tech and Yamaha Step Up for STEM at Local School
Georgia Tech recently partnered with Yamaha Motor Manufacturing Corporation of America (YMMC) to supply 26 Lego WeDo robotic toolkits and lesson plans to Willis Road Elementary School in Coweta County, Georgia.
YMMC, one of the county’s largest employers, and Georgia Tech’s College of Computing collaborated to buy the robotic kits and to develop learning modules for third-, fourth-, and fifth-graders at the school.
Students and teachers from the school's gifted program received the kits during an event at the school held Feb. 16. Others in attendance were YMMC Senior Analyst Melanie Sewell (GT ISYE '93), Willis Road Elementary School Principal Charles Smith, and lead undergraduate teaching assistant Ruchi Banerjee.
Why STEM is Important
The investment is part of the College’s Computing and Engineering with Legos and Scratch (CELS) program.
“The need for well-trained workers versed in computer science and engineering is growing exponentially,” said Mary Hudachek-Buswell, Georgia Tech computer science lecturer and CELS program developer.
“But the lack of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) exposure at an early age leads to few students choosing a career in these disciplines. This is particularly true for female and minority students,” she added.
“It is important that our young people are exposed to the STEM disciplines in a fun and innovative way, peaking their interest early will have a positive impact on helping create the next generation of scientists and engineers,” said Phil Trickey, vice president of YMMC.
Hudachek-Buswell and her undergraduate student teaching assistants at Georgia Tech have developed five lessons for each grade level based on the Lego WeDo toolkits and the programming language Scratch.
Ultimate Goal
The Lego toolkits are used in problem-based learning and feature motors and sensors that allow students to build, explore, and study machines and mechanisms. Scratch is an easy-to-use programming language that students can use to engage and control the robots that they design.
“Once we received feedback from the REACH teachers and the students, we’ll develop another set of 15 lessons,” said Hudachek-Buswell.
“In the short term, we hope to bring this program to more schools. Ultimately though, computer science and engineering modules need to be formally added to the public elementary school system in Georgia.”
YMMC is located about 30 minutes south of Atlanta in Newnan, Georgia, and employs more than 1,500 people in its facility, which consists of three plants.
Georgia Tech Researchers Bring Transparency to Telephone Blacklists
We’ve all gotten that call offering us something too good — or too terrifying — to be true: a free cruise, payday loan deals, an IRS audit. All they want is your credit card number.
These scam telephone calls are used to defraud victims and have increased dramatically with the rise of the Internet. While many of us don’t answer calls from unknown numbers or can detect a scam from the minute an operator “adjusts the headset,” senior citizens and new immigrants are often victims.
There is no central regulating agency that keeps a blacklist against these telephone scams. Users must rely on for-profit apps to keep their number safe, but only have their word these blacklists are comprehensive and effective. Georgia Tech researchers are bringing a new transparency to the industry by sourcing their own blacklists and evaluating how effective they are at blocking malicious calls.
“Everyone faces these problems because people are more likely to trust a phone call than an email,” said School of Computer Science Ph.D. student Sharbani Pandit.
The research was presented in the paper Towards Measuring the Effectiveness of Telephony Blacklists at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium in San Diego from Feb. 18–21. It’s the work of Pandit, SCS Professor Mustaque Ahamad, Tech adjunct and University of Georgia Associate Professor Roberto Perdisci, and phone security start-up Pindrop data scientist Payas Gupta.
The researchers found four data sources similar to what commercial apps use to create their blacklists:
- User-reported complaints to the Federal Trade Commission, totaling 1.56 million complaints regarding 300,000 phone numbers over a five-month period
- Complaints crowd-sourced from the internet, up to 600,000 complaints filed by users over a six-month period
- A call detail record (CDR) honeypot that tracks what number a bad call was made from, when, and to which number, resulting in calls from 200,000 source numbers to 58,000 destination numbers over a five-month period
- honeypot-based call audio recordings, featuring 19,090 audio recordings from 9,434 source numbers during a four-month period
Honeypots are collections of compromised phone numbers dropped by previous users because they were receiving too many bad calls. Pindrop, a startup founded by SCS graduates, built the honeypot used in this research.
The four data sources can be used to automatically learn long-running telephone scam/spam campaigns and create phone blacklists. The data sets were used to generate five blacklists in total.
Once created, the blacklists were evaluated for how effective they were at blocking bad calls. The blacklists were successful about 55 percent of the time, with only a .01 percent false positive rate for blocking calls from legitimate numbers. The blacklist is updated daily, ensuring the numbers are current.
This is just the beginning of this research. Next, they want to block the call before it even reaches the user. In order to do this, they have to learn about the content of the call, which is usually only apparent after the user has picked up the bad call.
“Even if you know a spam call is coming, your phone keeps continuously ringing and you’re bothered,” Pandit said. “So now we’re trying to figure out how to stop that from the content and not just the caller ID.”
The research has shined a light on an industry that was as in the dark as some of the numbers it was trying to block. Yet with more knowledge, the fake free cruises should dwindle.
Ethics Highlight 'Day of Machine Learning Discussion'
Machine learning at Georgia Tech was in the spotlight recently as The Center for Machine Learning at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) hosted its spring seminar on Feb. 22 in the Klaus Advanced Computing Building.
Billed as a “day of discussions around machine learning,” more than 200 students and faculty from across campus registered for the daylong event.
“AI is like going to the moon. Data science is the rocket, but machine learning is the fuel that is propelling us forward,” said ML@GT Director Irfan Essa.
“The field crosses a wide variety of disciplines so Georgia Tech is an ideal setting to build a home for thought leaders and train the next generation in machine learning.”
Algorithms and bias
The day began with an informal discussion over breakfast with Essa and Charles Isbell, executive associate dean and professor in the College of Computing.
“Developers tend to walk around feeling objective because it’s the algorithm that is determining the answer,” Isbell said in response to a question relating to the ethical aspects of machine learning.
“However, they need to ensure no bias is being introduced. The algorithms they create need to be ‘inspectable’ and must be able to explain their answers.”
Featured presentations
Following an update from the ML@GT leadership team about current research projects, recent achievements, and plans for the coming year, attendees were treated to lunch and a presentation from Princeton University’s Sanjeev Arora.
Arora, the Charles C. Fitzmorris Professor of Computer Science at Princeton, explored the mysteries of deep learning as he shared his thoughts on generative adversarial nets (GANs) and their efficacy in learning from relatively small data sets. Associate Professor Joelle Pineau from McGill University followed Arora. Her remarks circled back to ethical issues raised by artificial intelligence agents, such as chatbots.
ML@GT’s day of discussion wrapped up with another informal chat session and a reception in the Klaus Atrium.
ML@GT is an interdisciplinary research center launched in July 2016. A machine learning Ph.D. program was approved in June 2017. An inaugural class of approximately 15 students is scheduled to convene for the Fall 2017 semester.
Monica Sweat Named as New DCI Director
College of Computing Promotes Longtime Lecturer to Lead Key Instructional Team
Following a national search, the Georgia Tech College of Computing has selected Monica Sweat as its new director of the Division of Computing Instruction (DCI).
Dean of Computing Zvi Galil made the announcement to the College’s faculty and staff in an email on March 5.
“DCI is at the core of what we do in the College and we are very fortunate to have an incredibly talented team there. Monica has been an integral part of the team for nearly 20 years, and I am eager to see her take DCI to the next level as its new director,” said Galil.
Strengthening our foundation
Established in 2012, DCI is the home for the College’s 12 lecturers and instructors. DCI faculty members provide most of the foundational computer science courses for majors and non-majors. Sweat had been serving as DCI assistant director since October 2016.
“I could not be more pleased. The DCI faculty members are incredibly talented, and it is a privilege to work alongside them at Georgia Tech,” said Sweat.
“DCI is in a unique position to bring community and unity to the College. I look forward to DCI strengthening our foundation for the College and to our becoming a model for undergrad education and innovation across the campus and nationally.”
In her new role, Sweat is responsible for helping shape the lower division’s undergraduate curriculum, for scheduling, training, and fostering career development for DCI faculty, and for the hiring and training of undergraduate teaching assistants.
[READ: Leahy, Foley Awarded Emeritus Status]
Sweat is a graduate of the University of Florida and has been an award-winning lecturer and senior lecturer at the College of Computing for more than 17 years. She takes the DCI helm from Senior Lecturer Emeritus William “Bill” Leahy following his retirement late last year.
Second-Year Computing Student Brings Zero-Waste Living to Tech
It all started with a bamboo toothbrush.
When sophomore Clare Trively needed a new toothbrush, she looked for a biodegradable option. The computer science major is a member of Students Organizing for Sustainability (SOS), an environmental and economic sustainability student group, and she wanted to implement their goals into her daily life.
“I felt this rush of excitement when I saw the bamboo toothbrush because it went from this concept I had of living a sustainable life to actually making actions toward doing it,” Trively said.
After taking this first small step, Trively wanted to see if she could live a zero-waste lifestyle. The movement encourages producing as little trash as possible and reusing items. Coined in the 1970s, it has grown in popularity thanks to YouTube stars like Bea Johnson and Lauren Singer, who are so dedicated they can keep all of their trash for four years in one mason jar.
Yet Trively’s first experience with this lesser-impact lifestyle wasn’t the Internet, but when her family moved from Roswell to Malmo, Sweden, for two years when she was nine. “I would bike to school every day and take the milk bottles back to the grocery store,” Trively said. “I was always aware of this type of lifestyle but didn’t believe I could actually do it.”
With Johnson, Singer, and others as inspiration, Trively started her zero-waste lifestyle on Jan. 24, documenting it all in her own videos. She admits achieving zero-waste can be harder to put into practice while living on campus. but it is still possible.
“I don’t have as much control over my environment, but I do have control over how I choose to use it,” Trively said.
Trively carries around a reusable bag and cutlery everywhere she goes, doesn’t buy products in disposable containers like coffee, only wears second-hand clothes, and even makes her own toothpaste. She aims to inspire and encourage everyone to make their own small changes.
“It’s not about guilt-tripping yourself into doing this or being perfect by producing no waste,” said Trively, who admits she forgot that even cereal comes in a plastic bag the first month of living zero-waste. “It’s about being empowered to make the decision to be sustainable.”
One decision you can make today is saying no to plastic straws, Trively suggests. In the United States, every person uses 1.6 plastic straws day, which is nearly 500 million straws a day. Just refusing a plastic straw at a restaurant or bringing your own reusable straw could save nearly 600 straws a year — and keep a lot of plastic out of landfills.
“With sustainability, a small action can have a big impact.”
Assistant Professor Taesoo Kim Wins NSF CAREER Award for Fuzzing Research
School of Computer Science Assistant Professor Taesoo Kim received the National Science Foundation CAREER Award in March. The grant offers $500,000 over the next five years for chosen research.
Kim’s project, CAREER: System Techniques to Improve Fuzzing Performance, will focus on how to improve fuzzing efficiency. Fuzzing is an automatic software-testing technique that injects a mutated input into a program randomly. This process is effective in finding bugs in complex programs.
Fuzzing is so helpful for catching security risks that even industry has already adopted it. In fact, Google recently implemented a distributed, large-scale fuzzing infrastructure, ClusterFuzz, where hundreds of machines process more than 50 million test cases daily.
High performance is key to finding more bugs, so the future of fuzzing is to create faster, smarter fuzzers. Most research focuses on creating an input that is likely to trigger a vulnerability to catch a bug.
However, Kim’s project is moving in a different direction. He is looking to improve performance by shortening the execution time of each fuzzing instance, for example improving the scope of how much the fuzzing case targets. Kim’s project also hopes to address scaling and performance problems in system software layers.
“This work highlights the importance of enhancing performance of bug finding techniques from the perspectives of underlying systems,” Kim said. “With the funding, we will develop techniques that can drastically shorten the time to discover bugs through fuzzing.”
This research could save companies operational costs for their fuzzers. It will also help developers find more security bugs in open-source and commercial software. Overall, Kim’s work could lead to less glitchy, safer software for users.
The industry-focused research is a signature of Kim, who has been pursuing cutting-edge cybersecurity and systems research since he joined Georgia Tech in 2014.
"The NSF CAREER award recognizes the best young researchers,” Chair Lance Fortnow said. “It’s just one more indication of Taesoo Kim's expanding leadership in cybersecurity and computer systems."
College of Computing Rises to No. 8 in U.S. News Rankings
The Georgia Tech College of Computing continued its climb up the U.S. News and World Report rankings of graduate computer science programs, rising one spot to No. 8 in the 2018 rankings that were released on March 20.
The new position represents Georgia Tech’s second jump in the last three CS rankings, all released since 2012, and is the highest U.S. News has ever ranked the College of Computing.
GT Computing's global impact
“We are thrilled but not surprised at this latest recognition of the work we’re doing in GT Computing,” said Zvi Galil, John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing.
“I attribute this to our visible leadership in computing education and research, to the fact that we are now the largest computing program in the United States counting both faculty and students–and likely number 2 in terms of faculty size–and to the global impact we are having both through our research and the work of our thousands of alumni.”
U.S. News ranks computer science programs through a reputational survey. With our average score of 4.4, Georgia Tech has now tied with Princeton and one spot ahead of No. 10 University of Texas-Austin. In the 2018 rankings, Georgia Tech rose in both points and ranking—and was the only Top 10 program to rise in either.
The College also achieved rankings in the following specialties:
- Artificial Intelligence (No. 7)
- Programming Language (No. 16)
- Systems (No. 10)
- Theory (No. 9)
Coincidentally, the No. 8 overall ranking matches the spot Georgia Tech earned in last year’s Times Higher Education/Wall Street Journal rankings when the College was named the No. 8 program in the world.
Other GT ranking highlights
“Over the past several years,” Galil continued, “we have made deliberate, strategic investments of time and treasure, both in research and education, and this recognition is one of the fruits of those efforts.”
The College of Computing was just one of many Georgia Tech programs to place highly in the 2018 rankings.
The College of Engineering also ranked No. 8 (No. 4 among public universities), and all 11 of its programs ranked in the top 10. In the College of Sciences, Chemistry jumped four to No. 20, Math moved up two to No. 26, Physics moved up one to No. 28, Earth Sciences moved up four to No. 38, and Biology moved up one to No. 54. Within mathematics, the discrete math/combinatorics specialty had Georgia Tech at No. 2, up two positions.
[READ: U.S. News and World Report 2019 Graduate School Rankings]
The Scheller College of Business full-time MBA program moved up one to No. 28, and its part-time MBA moved up five to No. 25. Scheller was also ranked in the following specialties:
- Production/Operations (No. 7)
- Supply Chain/Logistics (No. 17)
- Information Systems (No. 12)
In the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, the Sam Nunn School of Public Policy moved up two to No. 43 overall with the Information and Technology Management specialty remaining at No. 2, Public Policy Analysis debuting at No. 20, and the Environmental Policy and Management specialty debuting at No. 12.
Professor Tom Conte Presents on Post-Moore Computing at NMMB Spring 2018 Meeting
The future of computing in the post-Moore era is always on the mind of computer architects. For decades, transistors per microchip doubled every 18 months, enabling faster, more innovative machines. How do we keep pushing computers forward even as this era ends?
[WATCH: CRNCH Time at Georgia Tech for Rebooting Computing Architecture]
The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine’s National Materials and Manufacturing Board (NMMB) Spring 2018 Meeting will address this question with its session Moore’s Law: Where We’ve Been and Where We Are Going in an Age at the End of Scaling on March 20 at the National Academies in Washington, D.C.
Tom Conte, a School of Computer Science professor and co-director of the Post-Moore–focused Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH), joins the event to offer his perspective on technology and alternative paths.
The session is part of a larger daylong event during which the NMMB hopes to identify areas that could impact government policymakers and program managers. Specialized electronics are integral to the defense industry, which needs reliable products that can be produced at low cost.
The post-Moore era is ripe for opportunities in technological innovation but could also present challenges in policy and economics. During this session, industry, academia, and government experts will discuss what the future of computing faces—from how to prolong the life of transistors to exploring alternative materials and architectures to push it forward.
The session will be divided into three panels on:
- Dennard Scaling / Equivalent Scaling
- Alternative trajectories, evaluating different materials
- Economics and policy
New Murals Representing Diverse GT Computing Community Unveiled
New, floor-to-ceiling murals in the College of Computing Building greeted students returning from spring break this week.
Created by well-known Atlanta multimedia artist Barry Lee, the murals are located in the building’s main stairwell. They feature vivid colors and whimsical characters engaging in computing activities.
“I love these images,” said Dean of Computing Zvi Galil. “The murals are very friendly, inviting, and are a great way to represent the diversity of our work and our people in the College.”
Computer science historically has been seen as a solitary pursuit. However, the murals push back against that outdated notion by highlighting community and the collaborative aspects of computing. Students working together, drones, binary code, equations, and of course, pizza, are just some of the elements of life at GT Computing featured in the murals.
“I really like the social aspect of the students. [The murals] are very conversational, atmospheric, and happy," said Tanya Churaman, a second-year computer science major.
[PHOTOS: See more pictures of the new murals]
According to Lee, the hardest part of this and most of his other commissions is staying true to his style, while also meeting a client's wishes.
"I think the most challenging thing [about this project] was translating a subject that is so scientific and concrete into creating a whimsical illustration without losing the intended theme of the mural," Lee said.
Each of the three murals is approximately 110 inches wide. Heights range between 123 and 193 inches. Although it looks as if they have been painted on the walls, the murals are overlaminate vinyl wraps. They were applied with a small amount of adhesive and then heated with a blowtorch. The heating shrinks the material, allowing it to adhere to the contours of the walls. The murals were installed on March 23.
Lee has created murals and public art pieces in Atlanta for MailChimp, CallRail, and the Bookhouse Pub.
School of CS Student Connects to the Community through Serve-Learn-Sustain
Professor Ellen Zegura's fall 2016 SLS class uses a smart cities participatory design from the SLS Toolkit.
When Phan Anh (Tom) Nguyen took the Computing for Good class in the fall of 2016, the School of Computer Science (SCS) master’s student knew he wanted to continue the work of the class well past the final project.
“I got a scholarship that funded my stay over here, so I thought it would be great if I could use my degree to make the world a better place,” Nguyen said. “I saw Computing for Good in the course catalogue and thought, ‘This must be it. This is a good place to start!’”
The Computing for Good mission
Computing for Good was started in 2008 to use computer science to improve the human condition. Students were partnered with local nonprofits to develop software, data analysis, and other tools to benefit the community. Despite the noble goal, the nonprofits could only achieve so much progress during a four-month class.
During his class, Nguyen helped build project management software for United Way. Although he appreciated the impact of this project, he wanted to push the Computing for Good mission further and work with one of its founders more, SCS Professor Ellen Zegura.
Around the same time, Nguyen started attending events hosted by Serve-Learn-Sustain (SLS), a Tech-wide educational initiative on community sustainability. When SLS was looking for a computer science student to help develop computing tools professors could integrate into their classes, Nguyen jumped on it.
Creating the SLS toolkit
The SLS Toolkit is a collection of guides and assignments that enable instructors to incorporate sustainability into their courses. SLS develops tools by determining what would be the most useful and most likely to be used by professors.
Zegura realized that a lot of computing courses revolve around data because it can be visualized, analyzed, or joined with other sets to generate larger findings. She believed a helpful SLS tool would be data sets professors could build projects around.
“The teaching toolkit is a library of resources to help instructors across disciplines,” Zegura said. “Tom Nguyen has focused specifically on data and sustainable communities to connect to computer science courses.”
Before they started compiling data, Nguyen interviewed five professors to learn how professors might use tools in their class to help the SLS mission.
“Working with professors to incorporate socially reflective questions in their class is too big of a jump,” Nguyen said. “You really have to work step by step and find data sets the students will be interested in and the professors will want to teach.”
Over the summer of 2017, Nguyen worked on three data sets:
- Data on vacant lots that could be converted into urban farms
- One year of data of how and when people use their MARTA Breeze card
- Where and when New Yorkers saw rodents to be extrapolated to a rodent infestation problem in Atlanta west side neighborhoods
Each data set is large and dynamic enough to interest professors and their students, but also socially focused enough to promote the SLS intention. The urban farming set is really about sourcing adequate food, the MARTA data set is about strengthening transportation infrastructure, and the rodent data set could be applied to improving living in communities close to Tech.
The data sets were rolled out at the end of the fall 2017 semester and are already being integrated into the syllabus. Director of the Division of Computing Instruction and Senior Lecturer Monica Sweat used the MARTA set in her database class.
For Nguyen, working with SLS is about more than just creating tools; it has changed his approach to computing. As a machine learning student, the focus is often on using systems to assist doctors or policy makers, but the communities next door need help, too, and not from cutting-edge tech.
“SLS completely opened up my mind about the role technology can play in our lives,” he said. “Instead of pushing technology on communities, the way I look at the world is to find the problem first and use stable technologies that can provide the necessary role in people’s lives.”
Students Compete for $125,000 in Funding for Cutting-Edge Cybersecurity Projects
From phishing scams to forensic cyberattack software, the next big security breakthrough will debut at the Cybersecurity Demo Day Finale on April 12.
Last fall, Georgia Tech students brought ideas on the cutting-edge of cybersecurity research to the Georgia Tech Cybersecurity Summit. The most promising teams continued in the competition with entrepreneurial coaching from VentureLab.
[RSVP now for the IISP Demo Day Finale]
Now the top five Georgia Tech student teams will present their projects with a TED-esque talk in front of business leaders like entrepreneur Christopher Klaus, managing partner for Tech Square Ventures Blake Patton, and vice president of strategy and product design at IBM Security Kevin Skapinetz. These teams are competing for $125,000 prize pool that includes: $5,000 cash, a spot in the Create-X Startup LAUNCH incubator – with $20,000 toward a prototype, $50,000 in legal services, and 27-weeks of free business mentoring – and eligibility for a $50,000 grant from the National Science Foundation.
We sat down the four School of Computer Science teams to learn more about their projects and what they hope to achieve at Demo Day.
"Phish or Fish"
Tony Zhaocheng Tan, with Anisha Bandihari and Simon Chung
What is your project?
Phishing, where an attacker sends an email under false pretenses to trick users into giving up their passwords, is the first step in many high-profile cyberattacks, such as the Democratic National Convention hack of 2016. Currently, the industry solution is to train users to hover over links and identify suspicious messages and websites. When this tedious and ineffective solution inevitably fails, users are often blamed for the fallout.
In this project, we propose to mitigate phishing by providing users with a more effective and usable interface. When a user clicks on an unknown link in an email, we automatically present them with a page that displays succinct and necessary information to help the user to make the right decision. By making critical security information easily accessible, but only when necessary, we can draw attention to anomalies and avoid user fatigue that often plagues typical security software.
What made you interested in entering Demo Day?
We entered Demo Day primarily to showcase our project and invite feedback from the public and industry.
If you win Demo Day, what would you do with the funds?
If we win Demo Day, we plan to use new resources to continue the development of our project in furtherance of cybersecurity.
"rtCaptcha"
What is your project?
Today, there is a new trend in replacing passwords with biometric authentication, and it seems it will be used widely in the future since it is easy to adopt. Major companies (e.g., Uber, Alipay and Mastercard) are using these services for biometric authentication. In our research, we found that many third-party, cloud-based services are providing audio and facial authentication to other large organizations, but their methods are prone to primitive spoofing attacks. The common mistake of current systems is that they still use simple challenges, such as smiling and blinking to prevent spoofing attacks. Any system that uses a fixed challenge like that is not secure. The challenge should always be randomized.
We are making the challenge harder by sending unpredictable requests in a Captcha image form and limiting the response time in order to rule out manipulation. The response time is a normal human response/reflex time to start reading a text when presented one. In our user study, the overall response time of the participants is less than a second (we fix this time to two seconds to eliminate false rejections).
In this way, rtCaptcha strengthens the computational challenge by forcing adversaries to figure out what the authentication tasks are and quickly combine them by synchronizing the voice, face, and personal knowledge of an individual in a way that appears lifelike. We force attackers to show, share, and say what only an individual could know – and do that in less than two seconds.
What made you interested in entering in Demo Day?
We want to improve and commercialize rtCaptcha and reach to companies that are using or have potential to use audio/visual authentication.
If you win Demo Day, what would you do with the funds?
We will possibly use the funds to advertise our technology. A spot in the Create-X Startup LAUNCH incubator is a great advantage to improve our technology by getting mentoring services from real business experts.
"OSS Police"
Ashish Bijlani, Ruian Duan, and Meng Xu
What is your project?
We are building a cloud-based audit platform for businesses that offers software under dual free/commercial licenses terms. This system quickly detects mobile apps violating a businesses’ licensing terms and creating new customers. Multiple companies have already expressed interest in using the technology.
What made you interested in entering in Demo Day?
We see Demo Day as a great opportunity to present our technology, share progress, and get valuable feedback. It will help us to be seen under a spotlight. We are very excited about it.
If you win Demo Day, what would you do with the funds?
We plan to invest the funds to further our engineering and customer discovery process.
"RAIN: Refinable Attack Investigation with On-demand Inter-process Information Flow Tracking"
Yang Ji, with Evan Downing, Mattia Fazzini, Sangho Lee, and Weiren Wang
What is your project?
RAIN pushes the granularity of cyber forensic analysis to a new level. It is able to reproduce any previous program state to recover the data causal relations at the lowest instruction level. Notably, RAIN incurs a low runtime overhead (less than 5 percent) to the program by using a record replay technique. We believe RAIN can help improve the analysis accuracy of many data breach incidents, such as Equifax and Yahoo!, by reporting which piece of data were exactly leaked without false positive.
What made you interested in entering in Demo Day?
Demo Day is a great platform for us to showcase recent research results to other interested people such as peer researchers and industries. It builds a channel for us to receive feedback to further improve our work. Also, it gives us a chance to earn more support to future research.
If you win Demo Day, what would you do with the funds?
We would like to extend the current prototype to a full commercial level and try deploying it in real systems.
VR Taking Students Where Once Only the Magic School Bus Could
A Georgia Tech undergraduate research team is taking local high school and middle school students where they’ve never been before – inside of plant and animal cells.
Fourth-year computer science major Aditya Vishwanath and fourth-year industrial engineering major Amrutha Vasan have developed a smartphone-based virtual reality (VR) video content based on Advanced Placement (AP) Biology course material.
The content was used for a recent study with students in Cobb County, Georgia, to determine the effectiveness of the new technology in the classroom. According to the research team, it may be the largest study of its kind.
"Seat belts, everyone!"
Nearly 350 high school and middle school students participated in the study, which was approved by Georgia Tech’s Institutional Review Board. The data-gathering portion of the study ended April 9. Although the analysis is not complete, initial results indicate that VR is likely to have positive educational outcomes for students.
“Along with almost a full letter-grade increase in factual knowledge over the control group, we’re seeing high increases in confidence levels, student engagement, and interest levels over the control group,” said Vishwanath who is mentored by Neha Kumar, assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing and the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs.
For the study, the team worked with Georgia Tech’s Center for Integrating Science, Mathematics and Computing (CEISMC) and teachers from the Georgia Department of Education for more than a year to co-design and develop the VR video content based on the state of Georgia’s curriculum standards.
“We held design workshops with different groups of teachers, students, parents, and others from across the state with the goal of designing the curriculum using guidelines and recommendations they gave us,” said team leader Vishwanath.
The team collaborated with teachers to create scripts based on AP content, which were then storyboarded and animated for the videos.
"OK bus, do your stuff!"
Not unlike the 1990s children’s show, The Magic School Bus, the 360-degree VR videos take students “inside” of a cell for up-close exploration. Once inside, a voiceover describes what students are seeing and how the different parts of the cell function. The series of VR videos cover topics including mitochondria, lysosomes, DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis.
"This is a unique chance for students to experience a cell from the inside," said Kristy Younker, a science teacher at Kennesaw Mountain High School taking part in the study. "Because they are already so comfortable with their cellphones, this technology may help students engage more with the subject matter."
Students participating in the study were divided into two groups – one engaging with the 360-degree VR content, the other serving as a control group.
Following normal course instruction for all of the students, the study group – using inexpensive easy-to-use cardboard VR viewers – watched a corresponding VR video for 10-15 minutes each day at the end of class. Students in the control group were asked to read from a textbook that provided the same content, but in written form with images and other illustrations.
"If you keep asking questions, you'll keep getting answers"
“We wanted to demonstrate how affordable this is. The only other technology needed is an internet connection and a smartphone, which most of the students already have,” said Vishwanath.
“We don’t believe that this technology will replace traditional instruction, but we think it may reinforce learning and empower students to ask deeper, more meaningful questions.”
Vishwanath believes the study may be the largest field study of its kind.
“A lot of research has shown that VR has high learning outcomes. But most, if not all, of the current research has been done in the lab with expensive equipment, not in an actual school setting. Very little of what has been done in the past has involved common core subjects like biology,” he said.
[PHOTOS: See all of the pictures from Kennesaw Mountain H.S.]
The team will wrap up the data analysis in the coming months and then submit the results for peer review. The team has also started up an entrepreneurial initiative to further explore the potential that VR could have for formal and informal learning in more global, underserved contexts.
Vishwanath is heading to Stanford University this fall to begin his Ph.D. in the Graduate School of Education’s Learning Sciences and Technology Design program. He is also a recent recipient of the prestigious Knight-Hennessy scholarship.
Three of GT Computing's Finest Honored at Awards Luncheon
Each year, Georgia Tech recognizes a group of faculty and staff members from across campus for their outstanding achievements.
This year, three people from the GT Computing community have been awarded at the annual Faculty and Staff Honors Luncheon held on April 11 in the Student Center Ballroom.
- Human Resources Director Pam Ruffin has been selected for the Spirit of Georgia Tech Award. Ruffin earned the inaugural award for inspiring others with “their presence and professionalism and creating an environment where others flourish and thrive.”
- Online Masters of Science in Computer Science Instructor David Joyner has earned the Curriculum Innovation Award. This award recognizes Joyner’s work to improve the “quality of education at Georgia Tech through pedagogical and curricular innovation.”
- Assistant Professor Devi Parikh has been recognized with this year’s Sigma Xi Young Faculty Award. This award “recognizes outstanding research achievements, as evidenced by publications, program development results, and other research contributions.”
“Congratulations to Pam, David, and Devi,” said Dean of Computing Zvi Galil. “These awards are very well-deserved and are a testament to their immense talents and dedication to the College community.”
Cryptography Expert Vlad Kolesnikov Joins the School of Computer Science
Blockchain has become one of the biggest buzzwords in security these days with the rise of Bitcoin. In this transaction method, everyone knows all of your information — from how much is in your account to where it’s going — in every step. Without the transparency, the whole system breaks down. But what if you want your information more protected?
Secure computation solves this by giving users encrypted wallets that acknowledge there is money inside without saying how much. Everyone can verify there is sufficient money to fund a transaction, but nobody knows how much you had, how much you paid, or how much you have now.
This type of cryptography is the main interest of new Associate Professor Vlad Kolesnikov, who joined the School of Computer Science in January. But it’s about more than just financial transactions.
“You want to compute the function on data owned by several principals, but you also want to never reveal their private inputs,” he says. This can apply to everything from sensitive government information to healthcare data. For example, a pharmaceutical company may want to search a medical database to create a new drug, but it would need to hide its search queries to stay competitive.
From Belarus to Blockchain
Although he liked tinkering with computers growing up in Belarus, they were not easily accessible.
“You had one hour of screen time, so you had to think what you were going to do,” Kolesnikov says.
When Kolesnikov went to college to study computer science, his approach was also intentional. He wanted to study something that impacted a broader audience than just theory. Cryptography wasn’t nearly as popular as it is now during his Ph.D. at University of Toronto, yet he was interested in the intersection of computer science and mathematical logic inherent to the field.
Every major computing field has a security risk that could be better protected using cryptography, from big data to bioinformatics. The bridging of the topics works in the other direction, too. For example, using programming languages techniques has the potential to significantly improve performance of general secure computation.
Training Future Cryptographers
During 11 years as a cryptography researcher at Bell Labs, Kolesnikov valued working with student interns, but there were limitations to how much they could be involved. He was searching for a livelier environment where he would have better access to students and found it at Tech.
Kolesnikov hasn’t even had to leave his office to meet them because Tech students come to his door. He can engage with more students interested in cryptography when he teaches a graduate seminar next fall and a cryptocurrencies class next spring.
Kolesnikov’s approach to teaching is to make sure students really engage with what they are learning. This is also how he approaches his research.
“You solve problems by understanding how things work — not by facts.”
Awards Celebration Highlights GT Computing Community Achievements
Each spring, the College recognizes the achievements of its students, faculty, and staff with an awards celebration. This year is no exception.
Nearly 200 students, faculty, and staff members gathered April 26 in the Georgia Tech Global Learning Center Atrium for the 27th Annual College of Computing Awards Celebration. Family and friends of the award winners also attended the event.
Dean of Computing Zvi Galil hosted the awards celebration and welcomed guests with an update on the College’s achievements and highlights from the past academic year.
“First, perhaps our best news of the year came just a few weeks ago: We rose to #8 in the U.S. News & World Report rankings of graduate computer science programs. This is the second time we’ve gone up in the last three rankings and continues a remarkable, 30-year run for GT Computing,” Galil said.

CRNCH Hosts Neuromorphic Workshop
Two dozen people had a unique opportunity to experiment with Georgia Tech–developed hardware that can be used for neuromorphic algorithms on April 27. The training session was part of the Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies’ (CRNCH) first Neuromorphic Workshop.
The all-day event featured overview talks and hands-on sessions with this novel hardware, known as field-programmable analog arrays (FPAA). It was led by School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and CRNCH Professor Jennifer Hasler. Several local and industry participants also presented short talks on their research into neuromorphic computing and current challenges in the area.
An FPAA is a configurable chip that uses analog and digital logic to implement algorithms, drastically reducing the power and size of the chip. For certain applications like neuromorphic computing, analog requires fewer transistors to do the same amount of work as digital and produces fewer errors. While analog computing is traditionally a challenging field for computer scientists, hardware like the FPAA and associated high-level and open-source toolsets developed by Hasler’s group allow researchers to create new analog-based algorithms.
“A single programmable and configurable analog chip can compute a large number of things,” Hasler said.
Providing new avenues for computing performance
Neuromorphic computers replicate the brain in structure, meaning they are highly parallel, run at lower power, and the fundamental unit computation is very small. The low-power nature of FPAAs makes them ideal for neuromorphic computing. Analog and digital hardware like the FPAA could be pivotal to providing new avenues for computing performance in the post-Moore’s law era, in which the number of transistors on an integrated circuit are no longer expected to double roughly every two years as they have for the past half-century.
“Interesting, novel hardware may be able to solve this post-Moore problem,” said Jeff Young, a research scientist in the School of Computer Science and organizer of the workshop.
The workshop gathered Tech students as well as researchers from prominent national labs such as Sandia, Oak Ridge, Lawrence Livermore, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The speakers’ short research talks expanded on how neuromorphic computing will evolve to tackle post-Moore challenges, including:
- Catherine Schumann, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Evolutionary optimization (EO) training for neuromorphic systems
- Fred Rothganger, Sandia National Laboratories, N2A: A computational tool for modeling from neurons to algorithms
- Constantine Dovrolis, SCS professor, From the Spatio-Temporal Organization of the Brain to Adaptive and Safe Lifelong Learning Machines
- Antonino Tumeo, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Exploring the intersection of graph analytics and machine learning
As a follow-up to the workshop, the FPAA will be added to the Rogues Gallery, CRNCH’s collection of obscure and unique hardware. CRNCH provides researchers from around the world access to these machines as part of its strategic goal of rethinking high performance computing. When the gallery launched in fall 2017, it had one specialized type of hardware, the Emu Chick, but has since grown to include field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), 3D stacked memory devices, and now the FPAA.
Dr. Isbell Goes to Washington – Again – to Discuss Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) – and its ever-expanding role in the U.S. economy – is in the spotlight today as technology leaders from business, government, and academia gather in Washington D.C. for a White House meeting to discuss the opportunities and challenges of this emerging technology.
The White House Office for Science and Technology Policy is hosting the daylong meeting, which executives from 35 major U.S. companies including Facebook, Amazon, Google, Intel, NVIDIA, and Oracle are expected to attend.
The focus of the meeting is AI research and development, workforce, and regulations.
Georgia Tech College of Computing Executive Associate Dean Charles Isbell, along with a small group of his peers from academia, has been invited to participate in the discussions.
[UPDATE: Charles Isbell sits down with WIRED to share his takeaways from White House AI meeting]
“There’s not a sector in the U.S. economy that isn’t being impacted by AI,” said Isbell. “But that doesn’t mean that what makes regulatory sense for, say the auto industry, will necessarily make sense for pharmaceuticals.”
He added, “The U.S. has a real opportunity to take the lead and set the standard for the ethical, human-centered development of AI – regardless of the sector – to deliver on the promise of this transformative technology in ways that we have yet to imagine.”
Representatives from the Pentagon and the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor, and Transportation are also slated to participate in the White House AI meeting.
Isbell was in Washington earlier this year testifying before the House Oversight Committee’s Subcommittee on Information Technology about the national and global impact of AI and machine learning.
School of Computer Science Students’ OSSPolice Wins Atlanta Startup Battle
What started as a research paper from Georgia Tech’s School of Computer Science might be the next big start-up. On May 8, the Tech team behind software licensing violation tool OSSPolice won $100,000 from TechSquare Labs at the Atlanta Startup Battle.
Two SCS Ph.D. students, Ashish Bijlani and Ruian Duan, pitched their tool to investors, startups, and engineers at TechSquare Labs. They were competing against five other finalists, culled from 500-plus applicants, for $100,000 in funding and access to office space and mentorship from TechSquare Labs.
“The Atlanta Startup Battle win provides us with an invaluable opportunity to work with seasoned mentors and entrepreneurs to validate our business model and target more customer segments,” Bijlani said. “We can’t wait to see what the future holds for us.”
OSSPolice is a cloud-based tool for mobile app developers to easily and quickly identify OSS license violations and security vulnerabilities. This is a promising tool in a climate where many developers use open-source code for their apps but do not have the time or resources to ensure the code is uncompromised.
The tool has been gaining momentum since they first presented their paper at ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security last October. In April, the team won $125,000 at Tech’s Cybersecurity Demo Day.
The app has evolved throughout the months into a full-featured cloud-based auto technology to scan mobile app stores. It has also garnered interest from businesses such as Artifex, which sells its software under dual open-source/commercial license.
Businesses like this may want to use the OSSPolice audit technology to detect freeloaders and approach them to sell its proprietary services. Bijlani and Duan are also talking to businesses that want to proactively scan their internal apps for legal and security risks.
The team hopes to use the battle money to build the first version of the tool that customers can use and provide feedback on. They also plan to do more product-market fit and customer discovery to target more potential users.
GT Computing Community Welcomes New Alumni
The College of Computing honored its new alumni and their achievements with two celebrations earlier this month. The GT Computing community welcomed 381 new bachelor’s of science alumni, 469 new master’s of science alumni, and 15 new Ph.D. alumni this spring.
The festivities kicked off on May 3 with the Spring 2018 Dean's New Graduate Alumni Celebration held at Georgia Tech’s Historic Academy of Medicine. More than 100 Ph.D., MS Computer Science (CS), OMSCS, and MS in Human-Computer Interaction graduates, along with their family and friends, attended the evening event.
“Graduating from Georgia Tech is not easy. In fact, it’s probably been one of the biggest challenges of your lives,” said Dean of Computing Zvi Galil. “But, as they say, membership has its rewards, and you’ll find that your diploma will open a lot of doors for you.”
“So remember us when you are out making the world a computationally better place. All of us at the College of Computing are very proud of you, what you have done, and what you have yet to do. Congratulations once again.”
Prior to the celebration, many of the graduating OMSCS students and their families were treated to a campus tour led by the College's associate director of student experience, David Joyner.
'Go break some eggs'
New undergraduate GT Computing alumni were in the spotlight the following day. More than 200 people attended the Spring 2018 Dean’s New Undergraduate Alumni Celebration held on May 4 in the Klaus Advanced Computing Building Atrium.
“…As you stand on the precipice of this amazing success, remember that, without fail, we ALL fail…but, failure is the single greatest teacher you will ever encounter, Yes, even better than Bill Leahy. Failure teaches you profound lessons about your work and, more importantly, about yourself,” Galil said.
“Persistence is one of the greatest virtues, and when paired with talent and ambition, can produce greatness. Each of you has that within you, and I hope your time at Georgia Tech has helped you find it. So, congratulations and best of luck as you step into a much wider world. I leave you with one more quote, from no less than the great Tony Stark – ‘Go break some eggs.’”
This spring, the College’s faculty represented about 9 percent of Georgia Tech faculty. B.S. graduates from the College represented 18.5 percent of the campus total while M.S. graduates represented 35.2 percent of all Tech grads this past semester.
The College’s OMSCS program had 339 new graduates this spring, which brings the total number of graduates to date to 1,234.
Georgia Tech Researchers Find New Way to Detect Logic Bugs
Researchers in Georgia Tech’s School of Computer Science have modeled and detected a unique type of logic bug, a nefarious brand of malware that causes a system to operate incorrectly without crashing and creates vulnerabilities.
The double-fetch bug, presented in a paper at the 2018 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy on May 21-23 in San Francisco, is a special type of logic bug that can cause data inconsistencies in the program’s execution path and compromise security.
“We think we can find a systematic way to model and detect the double-fetch bug,” said SCS Ph.D. student Meng Xu, one of the researchers on the project. “We hope we can apply this experience to detect other types of logic bugs in kernels.”
Defining the double-fetch bug
The kernel is the core of an operating system. One bug in the kernel can take down the entire application. Yet this type of bug is inherently hard to detect.
A double-fetch bug operates when a kernel reads the userspace memory (i.e. random access memory calls) more than once while simultaneously a user thread scrambles the information in the region. This causes data inconsistences that open the kernel up to security vulnerabilities.
The researchers created a tool called Deadline to identify and cull double-fetch bugs in three steps.
- They formally define the conditions that two consecutive userspace fetches have to satisfy before it’s a considered a double-fetch bug.
- They use a static analysis (a way to examine the code without running the program) to collect as many fetch pairs as possible based on the kernel source code.
- They apply symbolic checking (converting the code into symbolic representations tested against the double-fetch criteria) on each of the fetch pairs to determine whether they are double-fetch bugs.
Thinking outside the kernel
Using this method, the researchers tested Deadline on Linux and FreeBSD kernels, finding 23 new bugs in Linux and one in FreeBSD.
Double-fetch bugs may lurk in more than just kernels, but any memory region divided into subregions or reading a system multiple times. This means double-fetch bugs could be in hypervisors (Xen, KVM), trusted execution environments (SGX, TrustZone), and even OS-like userspace programs like Chrome.
Yet this research could go beyond double-fetch bugs. They believe this method — creating a formal definition for a systematic approach, using static analysis for scalability and coverage, and verifying with symbolic checking for precision — can be used to create more bug-finding tools.
This research was presented in a paper, titled Precise and Scalable Detection of Double-Fetch Bugs in Kernels, at 2018 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy. The research is the work of SCS Ph.D. students Meng Xu and Chenxiong Qian, University of Minnesota Assistant Professor Kangjie Lu, Chairman and Scientific Director of the CISPA Helmholtz Center i.G. Michael Backes, and SCS Assistant Professor Taesoo Kim.
ARC Hosts Third Workshop on Algorithms and Randomness
The School of Computer Science’s Algorithms and Randomness Center (ARC) hosted its third Algorithms and Randomness Workshop from May 14 to 17. More than 70 scholars attended the 27 talks by leading researchers in the field.
The workshop brought together researchers from multiple disciplines, including combinatorics, computational complexity, optimization, probability, randomized algorithms, and statistical physics. While some speakers presented recent breakthrough results, others gave overviews on specific research areas or problems.
Some research highlights:
-Daniel Dadush, a researcher at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (Netherlands) and a GT alumnus, presented A Friendly Smoothed Analysis of the Simplex Method, providing an improved and simpler analysis of the shadow vertex simplex method.
-Professor Mark Jerrum of Queen Mary University of London, a Markov chain Monte Carlo pioneer, presented A Polynomial-Time Approximation Algorithm for All-Terminal Network Reliability on all terminal reliability of undirected graphs.
-Will Perkins, a fellow at University of Birmingham (UK), presented Sphere Packings, Codes, and Kissing Numbers via Hard Core Models, proving a lower bound on the expected size of spherical code from hard cap models.
-Professor Sofya Raskhodnikova of Boston University, an expert on property testing, presented Fast Algorithms for Testing Geometric Properties, which included an introduction and survey of the field.
-Professor Virginia Vassilevska-Williams of MIT presented Towards Tight Approximation Bounds for Graph Diameter and Eccentricities about breakthrough lower bounds on estimating the diameter of a graph, assuming the strong exponential-time hypothesis.
The workshop—organized by ARC director Professor Eric Vigoda, Professor Santosh Vempala, and Professor Prasad Tetali—also intended to introduce burgeoning scholars to the larger community and foster collaboration.
“Several senior researchers were particularly impressed at the next generation of researchers, judging by the high-quality results and lectures presented,” said Tetali. “It was gratifying, as well as humbling, to see and hear of breakthrough results by former postdocs and students of Georgia Tech colleagues and their collaborators.”
OMSCS Receives Funding for First-ever Fellowship Grants
Georgia Tech’s online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program has received funding for its first-ever fellowship grants.
The OMSCS SnapTravel Fellowships will provide two $1,000 fellowships. One fellowship will be awarded annually to a qualified student demonstrating entrepreneurial initiative. The second will be awarded annually to a qualified female or minority student. The total cost of an OMSCS degree is approximately $6,600.
The fellowships are inspired by Henry Shi, a recent OMSCS graduate and co-founder of Toronto-based SnapTravel.
[FULL STORY: OMSCS Alumnus and Co-Founder of SnapTravel Gives Back with New Fellowship Program]
“I’m a young founder, and I feel like a lot of young founders aren’t necessarily thinking of giving back so early in their startup careers,” said Shi.
“For me, it’s incredibly important to pay forward my experiences — especially with a program like OMSCS, an idea that’s so new and mission-driven that it wasn’t even possible just five years ago.”
Interested OMSCS candidates can visit the SnapTravel website to submit an application for one of the two available OMSCS SnapTravel Fellowships. Applicants must be students currently enrolled in the program, or who have applied and been accepted to the program. The deadline to apply for the 2018/19 academic year is June 30.

Georgia Tech at CVPR 2018
Interactive Classification for Deep Learning Interpretation (Angel Cabrera, Fred Hohman, Jason Lin, Polo Chau)
ABSTRACT: We present an interactive system enabling users to manipulate images to explore the robustness and sensitivity of deep learning image classifiers. Using modern web technologies to run in-browser inference, users can remove image features using inpainting algorithms and obtain new classifications in real time, which allows them to ask a variety of “what if” questions by experimentally modifying images and seeing how the model reacts. Our system allows users to compare and contrast what image regions humans and machine learning models use for classification, revealing a wide range of surprising results ranging from spectacular failures (e.g., a water bottle image becomes a concert when removing a person) to impressive resilience (e.g., a baseball player image remains correctly classified even without a glove or base).
3D-RCNN: Instance-Level 3D Object Reconstruction via Render-and-Compare (Abhijit Kundu, Yin Li, Jim Rehg)
ABSTRACT: We present a fast inverse-graphics framework for instance-level 3D scene understanding. We train a deep convolutional network that learns to map image regions to the full 3D shape and pose of all object instances in the image. Our method produces a compact 3D representation of the scene, which can be readily used for applications like autonomous driving. Many traditional 2D vision outputs, like instance segmentations and depth-maps, can be obtained by simply rendering our output 3D scene model. We exploit class-specific shape priors by learning a low dimensional shape-space from collections of CAD models. We present novel representations of shape and pose, that strive towards better 3D equivariance and generalization. In order to exploit rich supervisory signals in the form of 2D annotations like segmentation, we propose a differentiable Render-and-Compare loss that allows 3D shape and pose to be learned with 2D supervision. We evaluate our method on the challenging real-world datasets of Pascal3D+ and KITTI, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.
Embodied Question Answering (Abhishek Das, Samyak Datta, Georgia Gkioxari, Stefan Lee, Devi Parikh, Dhruv Batra)
ABSTRACT: We present a new AI task – Embodied Question Answering (EmbodiedQA) – where an agent is spawned at a random location in a 3D environment and asked a question (‘What color is the car?’). In order to answer, the agent must first intelligently navigate to explore the environment, gather information through first-person (egocentric) vision, and then answer the question (‘orange’). This challenging task requires a range of AI skills – active perception, language understanding, goal-driven navigation, commonsense reasoning, and grounding of language into actions. In this work, we develop the environments, end-to-end-trained reinforcement learning agents, and evaluation protocols for EmbodiedQA.
Attend and Interact: Higher-Order Object Interactions for Video Understanding (Chih-Yao Ma, Asim Kadav, Iain Melvin, Zsolt Kira, Ghassan AlRegib, Hans Peter Graf)
ABSTRACT: Human actions often involve complex interactions across several inter-related objects in the scene. However, existing approaches to fine-grained video understanding or visual relationship detection often rely on single object representation or pairwise object relationships. Furthermore, learning interactions across multiple objects in hundreds of frames for video is computationally infeasible and performance may suffer since a large combinatorial space has to be modeled. In this paper, we propose to efficiently learn higher-order interactions between arbitrary subgroups of objects for fine-grained video understanding. We demonstrate that modeling object interactions significantly improves accuracy for both action recognition and video captioning, while saving more than 3-times the computation over traditional pairwise relationships. The proposed method is validated on two large-scale datasets: Kinetics and ActivityNet Captions. Our SINet and SINet-Caption achieve state-of-the-art performances on both datasets even though the videos are sampled at a maximum of 1 FPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work modeling object interactions on open domain large-scale video datasets, and we additionally model higher-order object interactions, which improves the performance with low computational costs.
Don’t Just Assume; Look and Answer: Overcoming Priors for Visual Question Answering (Aishwarya Agrawal, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh, Aniruddha Kembhavi)
ABSTRACT: A number of studies have found that today’s Visual Question Answering (VQA) models are heavily driven by superficial correlations in the training data and lack sufficient image grounding. To encourage the development of models geared toward the latter, we propose a new setting for VQA where for every question type, train and test sets have different prior distributions of answers. Specifically, we present new splits of the VQA v1 and VQA v2 datasets, which we call Visual Question Answering under Changing Priors (VQACP v1 and VQA-CP v2 respectively). First, we evaluate several existing VQA models under this new setting and show that their performance degrades significantly compared to the original VQA setting. Second, we propose a novel Grounded Visual Question Answering model (GVQA) that contains inductive biases and restrictions in the architecture specifically designed to prevent the model from ‘cheating’ by primarily relying on priors in the training data. Specifically, GVQA explicitly disentangles the recognition of visual concepts present in the image from the identification of plausible answer space for a given question, enabling the model to more robustly generalize across different distributions of answers. GVQA is built off an existing VQA model – Stacked Attention Networks (SAN). Our experiments demonstrate that GVQA significantly outperforms SAN on both VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets. Interestingly, it also outperforms more powerful VQA models such as Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling (MCB) in several cases. GVQA offers strengths complementary to SAN when trained and evaluated on the original VQA v1 and VQA v2 datasets. Finally, GVQA is more transparent and interpretable than existing VQA models.
Mobile Video Object Detection With Temporally-Aware Feature Maps (Mason Liu, Menglong Zhu)
ABSTRACT: This paper introduces an online model for object detection in videos designed to run in real-time on low-powered mobile and embedded devices. Our approach combines fast single-image object detection with convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to create an interweaved recurrent-convolutional architecture. Additionally, we propose an efficient Bottleneck-LSTM layer that significantly reduces computational cost compared to regular LSTMs. Our network achieves temporal awareness by using Bottleneck-LSTMs to refine and propagate feature maps across frames. This approach is substantially faster than existing detection methods in video, outperforming the fastest single-frame models in model size and computational cost while attaining accuracy comparable to much more expensive single-frame models on the Imagenet VID 2015 dataset. Our model reaches a real-time inference speed of up to 15 FPS on a mobile CPU.
Decoupled Networks (Weiyang Liu, Zhen Liu, Zhiding Yu, Bo Dai, Rongmei Lin, Yisen Wang, Jim Rehg, Le Song)
ABSTRACT: Inner product-based convolution has been a central component of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the key to learning visual representations. Inspired by the observation that CNN-learned features are naturally decoupled with the norm of features corresponding to the intra-class variation and the angle corresponding to the semantic difference, we propose a generic decoupled learning framework which models the intra-class variation and semantic difference independently. Specifically, we first reparametrize the inner product to a decoupled form and then generalize it to the decoupled convolution operator which serves as the building block of our decoupled networks. We present several effective instances of the decoupled convolution operator. Each decoupled operator is well motivated and has an intuitive geometric interpretation. Based on these decoupled operators, we further propose to directly learn the operator from data. Extensive experiments show that such decoupled reparameterization renders significant performance gain with easier convergence and stronger robustness.
Geometry-Aware Learning of Maps for Camera Localization (Samarth Brahmbhatt, Jinwei Gu, Kihwan Kim, James Hays, Jan Kautz)
ABSTRACT: Maps are a key component in image-based camera localization and visual SLAM systems: they are used to establish geometric constraints between images, correct drift in relative pose estimation, and relocalize cameras after lost tracking. The exact definitions of maps, however, are often application-specific and hand-crafted for different scenarios (e.g. 3D landmarks, lines, planes, bags of visual words). We propose to represent maps as a deep neural net called MapNet, which enables learning a data-driven map representation. Unlike prior work on learning maps, MapNet exploits cheap and ubiquitous sensory inputs like visual odometry and GPS in addition to images and fuses them together for camera localization. Geometric constraints expressed by these inputs, which have traditionally been used in bundle adjustment or pose-graph optimization, are formulated as loss terms in MapNet training and also used during inference. In addition to directly improving localization accuracy, this allows us to update the MapNet (i.e., maps) in a self-supervised manner using additional unlabeled video sequences from the scene. We also propose a novel parameterization for camera rotation which is better suited for deep-learning based camera pose regression. Experimental results on both the indoor 7-Scenes dataset and the outdoor Oxford RobotCar dataset show significant performance improvement over prior work.
Iterative Learning With Open-Set Noisy Labels (Yisen Wang, Weiyang Liu, Xingjun Ma, James Bailey, Hongyuan Zha, Le Song, Shu-Tao Xia)
ABSTRACT: Large-scale datasets possessing clean label annotations are crucial for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, labeling large-scale data can be very costly and error-prone, and even high-quality datasets are likely to contain noisy (incorrect) labels. Existing works usually employ a closed-set assumption, whereby the samples associated with noisy labels possess a true class contained within the set of known classes in the training data. However, such an assumption is too restrictive for many applications, since samples associated with noisy labels might in fact possess a true class that is not present in the training data. We refer to this more complex scenario as the open-set noisy label problem and show that it is nontrivial in order to make accurate predictions. To address this problem, we propose a novel iterative learning framework for training CNNs on datasets with open-set noisy labels. Our approach detects noisy labels and learns deep discriminative features in an iterative fashion. To benefit from the noisy label detection, we design a Siamese network to encourage clean labels and noisy labels to be dissimilar. A reweighting module is also applied to simultaneously emphasize the learning from clean labels and reduce the effect caused by noisy labels. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet and real-world noisy (web-search) datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can robustly train CNNs in the presence of a high proportion of open-set as well as closed-set noisy labels.
Neural Baby Talk (Jiasen Lu, Jianwei Yang, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh)
ABSTRACT: We introduce a novel framework for image captioning that can produce natural language explicitly grounded in entities that object detectors find in the image. Our approach reconciles classical slot filling approaches (that are generally better grounded in images) with modern neural captioning approaches (that are generally more natural sounding and accurate). Our approach first generates a sentence ‘template’ with slot locations explicitly tied to specific image regions. These slots are then filled in by visual concepts identified in the regions by object detectors. The entire architecture (sentence template generation and slot filling with object detectors) is end-to-end differentiable. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed model on different image captioning tasks. On standard image captioning and novel object captioning, our model reaches state-of-the-art on both COCO and Flickr30k datasets. We also demonstrate that our model has unique advantages when the train and test distributions of scene compositions – and hence language priors of associated captions – are different.
TextureGAN: Controlling Deep Image Synthesis With Texture Patches (Wenqi Xian, Patsorn Sangkloy, Varun Agrawal, Amit Raj, Jingwan Lu, Chen Fang, Fisher Yu, James Hays)
ABSTRACT: In this paper, we investigate deep image synthesis guided by sketch, color, and texture. Previous image synthesis methods can be controlled by sketch and color strokes but we are the first to examine texture control. We allow a user to place a texture patch on a sketch at arbitrary locations and scales to control the desired output texture. Our generative network learns to synthesize objects consistent with these texture suggestions. To achieve this, we develop a local texture loss in addition to adversarial and content loss to train the generative network. We conduct experiments using sketches generated from real images and textures sampled from a separate texture database and results show that our proposed algorithm is able to generate plausible images that are faithful to user controls. Ablation studies show that our proposed pipeline can generate more realistic images than adapting existing methods directly
SktechyGAN: Towards Diverse and Realistic Sketch to Image Synthesis (Wengling Chen, James Hays)
ABSTRACT: Synthesizing realistic images from human drawn sketches is a challenging problem in computer graphics and vision. Existing approaches either need exact edge maps, or rely on retrieval of existing photographs. In this work, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) approach that synthesizes plausible images from 50 categories including motorcycles, horses and couches. We demonstrate a data augmentation technique for sketches which is fully automatic, and we show that the augmented data is helpful to our task. We introduce a new network building block suitable for both the generator and discriminator which improves the information flow by injecting the input image at multiple scales. Compared to state-of-the-art image translation methods, our approach generates more realistic images and achieves significantly higher Inception Scores.
MorphNet: Fast & Simple Resource-Constrained Structure Learning of Deep Networks (Ariel Gordon, Elad Eban, Ofir Nachum, Bo Chen, Hao Wu, Tien-Ju Yang, Edward Choi)
ABSTRACT: We present MorphNet, an approach to automate the design of neural network structures. MorphNet iteratively shrinks and expands a network, shrinking via a resourceweighted sparsifying regularizer on activations and expanding via a uniform multiplicative factor on all layers. In contrast to previous approaches, our method is scalable to large networks, adaptable to specific resource constraints (e.g. the number of floating-point operations per inference), and capable of increasing the network’s performance. When applied to standard network architectures on a wide variety of datasets, our approach discovers novel structures in each domain, obtaining higher performance while respecting the resource constraint.
Georgia Tech Team Receives DARPA Grant to Apply Neuroscience to Machine Learning
Siri knows where you live, but she couldn’t drive you there. Despite their name, artificial neural networks are very different from the brain. Yet machine learning performance could be improved if informed by state-of-the-art neuroscience.
A team of researchers from Georgia Tech and other local universities would study this problem with a grant up to $2 million, dependent on successful completion of milestones, from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M) program managed by Dr. Hava Siegelmann. DARPA’s goal would be to develop new machine learning approaches that enable systems to learn continually while they operate and apply prior knowledge to new situations.
School of Computer Science Professor Constantine Dovrolis, Georgia Tech Research Institute Senior Research Scientist Zsolt Kira, Georgia State University neuroscience Professor Sarah Pallas, and Emory biology Associate Professor Astrid Prinz are collaborating on the two-year project.
Bringing neural networks to the 21st century
The concept of modeling a computational neural network based on the brain first arose in the 1950s, but it hasn’t evolved much since.
“Obviously, since the ‘50s there’s been a lot of progress in neuroscience, but not a lot of it has translated to machine learning,” Kira said. “Supervised machine learning through neural networks is fundamentally a computer scientist’s translation of a high-level understanding of the brain from the past. But I think there’s a lot we can learn from contemporary neuroscience.”
One of the fundamental problems of machine learning that neuroscience could alleviate is what Dovrolis calls “catastrophic forgetting.” When the artificial neural network learns a new task, it often forgets the previous one.
“Deep learning networks are very different from the brain, both in terms of structure (architecture) and function (dynamics),” Dovrolis said.
Take the brain of a baby. Within the first few years of life, it not only has the ability to learn but also to generalize with very little supervision. Dovrolis believes that machine learning can achieve the same goal but only through a major departure from the currently established machine learning paradigms.
“The brain is really the only example of general intelligence we have,” Dovrolis said. “It makes sense to take that example, identify its fundamental principles, and transfer them to the computational domain.”
Bridging the gap between neuro and computer science
It may make sense, but it’s also controversial. Many computer scientists see the brain as mere hardware, and they prefer to focus instead on more statistical machine learning approaches. This is why this project is so unique: It brings together different ideas from network science, machine learning, evolutionary computing, computational neuroscience, and systems neuroscience — fields that should’ve been working together from the start.
“It’s easier for each field to work by themselves because it’s very comfortable,” Kira said. “But there’s a lot of potential if you actually make the effort to bring people together.”
Yet working with neuroscientists doesn’t just benefit computer scientists. Many neuroscientists believe computing could help with better modeling of biological networks, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of how the brain works.
“Neuroscience can in turn be guided by results from machine learning research that can inform new experiments to deepen our understanding of the brain,” Prinz said.
One of these examples is the flexibility of the brain.
"Neural circuits in the developing brain are highly flexible and adaptable to environmental changes, which endows them with an ability to learn rapidly and to self-repair after damage,” Pallas said.
Adult brains are much less plastic, so one of the neuroscientists’ goals is to uncover the neuronal mechanism that regulates the level of plasticity versus stability in brain circuits. With this, they can harness the mechanism for medical purposes and design machines that can continue learning without forgetting.
Approaching the research
The project should attempt to address five goals of the L2M program:
• Continual learning: The building block of the cortex is a largely invariant structure referred to as a “cortical column.” The function of cortical columns is not known yet, but it seems that they act as associative memories and predictors. The structure of cortical columns suggests that recurrent neural networks could learn incrementally and in an unsupervised manner simply by interacting with the environment.
• Adaptation to new tasks/environments: These cortical columns could interconnect through deep brain-wide hierarchies and nested feedback loops that interact and inform each other, enabling the brain to adapt to different environments with minimal need for re-training.
• Goal-driven perception: At any time, the brain is receiving data from many sensory sources. Hierarchical neural networks could use task-driven inputs to adjust low-level sensory processing and integration dynamically, depending on top-down goal-related signals.
• Selective plasticity: The project should be investigating how the connections and weights between (artificial) neurons could be adjusted when a new task is encountered, without catastrophically forgetting previous tasks. Neuromodulator-driven plasticity and homeostatic plasticity are two biological mechanisms that could be transferred in machine learning to address this problem.
• Monitoring and safety: Researchers would also investigate how to ensure stability and safety, based on the organization of the brain’s autonomic nervous system. Additionally, the safety concern could be further addressed through an “artificial impulse control” system, operating on the same prediction principles as the corresponding cortical system.
This research could allow machine learning to become increasingly adaptive and continually learn, which could have vast applications. A self-driving car could be programmed in the summer, but with these principles, it could learn how to drive in previously untested winter conditions. Siri could be next.

Non-convex Conditional Gradient Sliding
chao qu (technion) · Yan Li (Georgia Institute of Technology) · Huan Xu (Georgia Tech)
Abstract: We investigate a projection-free method, namely conditional gradient sliding on batched, stochastic and finite-sum non-convex problem. CGS is a smart combination of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method and Frank-Wolfe (FW) method and outperforms FW in the convex setting by saving gradient computations. However, the study of CGS in the non-convex setting is limited. In this paper, we propose the non-convex conditional gradient sliding (NCGS) which surpasses the non-convex Frank-Wolfe method in batched, stochastic and finite-sum setting.
Learning to Explain: An Information-Theoretic Perspective on Model Interpretation
Jianbo Chen (University of California, Berkeley) · Le Song (Georgia Institute of Technology) · Martin Wainwright (University of California at Berkeley) · Michael Jordan (UC Berkeley)
Abstract: We introduce instance wise feature selection as a methodology for model interpretation. Our method is based on learning a function to extract a subset of features that are most informative for each given example. This feature selector is trained to maximize the mutual information between selected features and the response variable, where the conditional distribution of the response variable given the input is the model to be explained. We develop an efficient variational approximation to the mutual information and show the effectiveness of our method on a variety of synthetic and real data sets using both quantitative metrics and human evaluation.
Learning Registered Point Processes from Idiosyncratic Observations
Hongteng Xu (InfiniaML, Inc) · Lawrence Carin (Duke) · Hongyuan Zha (Georgia Institute of Technology)
Abstract: A parametric point process model is developed, with modeling based on the assumption that sequential observations often share latent phenomena, while also possessing idiosyncratic effects. An alternating optimization method is proposed to learn a "registered" point process that accounts for shared structure, as well as "warping" functions that characterize idiosyncratic aspects of each observed sequence. Under reasonable constraints, in each iteration, we update the sample-specific warping functions by solving a set of constrained nonlinear programming problems in parallel and update the model by maximum likelihood estimation. The justifiability, complexity, and robustness of the proposed method are investigated in detail, and the influence of sequence stitching on the learning results is examined empirically. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the method yields explainable point process models, achieving encouraging results compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Stochastic Training of Graph Convolutional Networks
Jianfei Chen (Tsinghua University) · Jun Zhu (Tsinghua University) · Le Song (Georgia Institute of Technology)
Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are powerful deep neural networks for graph-structured data. However, GCN computes the representation of a node recursively from its neighbors, making the receptive field size grow exponentially with the number of layers. Previous attempts on reducing the receptive field size by sub-sampling neighbors do not have a convergence guarantee, and their receptive field size per node is still in the order of hundreds. In this paper, we develop control variate-based algorithms, which allow sampling an arbitrarily small neighbor size. Furthermore, we prove new theoretical guarantee for our algorithms to converge to a local optimum of GCN. Empirical results show that our algorithms enjoy a similar convergence with the exact algorithm using only two neighbors per node. The runtime of our algorithms on a large Reddit dataset is only one-seventh of previous neighbor sampling algorithms.
Variance Regularized Counterfactual Risk Minimization via Variational Divergence Minimization
Hang Wu (Georgia Institute of Technology) · May Wang (Georgia Institute of Technology)
Abstract: Off-policy learning, the task of evaluating and improving policies using historical data collected from a logging policy, is important because on-policy evaluation is usually expensive and has adverse impacts. One of the major challenges of off-policy learning is to derive counterfactual estimators that also have low variance and thus low generalization error.
In this work, inspired by learning bounds for importance sampling problems, we present a new counterfactual learning principle for off-policy learning with bandit feedbacks. Our method regularizes the generalization error by minimizing the distribution divergence between the logging policy and the new policy, and removes the need for iterating through all training samples to compute sample variance regularization in prior work. With neural network policies, our end-to-end training algorithms using variational divergence minimization showed significant improvement over conventional baseline algorithms and are also consistent with our theoretical results.
More Robust Doubly Robust Off-policy Evaluation
Mehrdad Farajtabar (Georgia Tech) · Yinlam Chow (DeepMind) · Mohammad Ghavamzadeh (Google DeepMind and INRIA)
Abstract: We study the problem of off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning (RL), where the goal is to estimate the performance of a policy from the data generated by another policy(ies). In particular, we focus on the doubly robust (DR) estimators that consist of an importance sampling (IS) component and a performance model. We utilize the low (or zero) bias of IS and low variance of the model at the same time. Although the accuracy of the model has a huge impact on the overall performance of DR, most of the work on using the DR estimators in OPE has been focused on improving the IS part, and not much on how to learn the model. In this paper, we propose alternative DR estimators, called more robust doubly robust (MRDR), that learn the model parameter by minimizing the variance of the DR estimator. We first present a formulation for learning the DR model in RL. We then derive formulas for the variance of the DR estimator in both contextual bandits and RL, such that their gradients with reference to the model parameters can be estimated from the samples, and propose methods to efficiently minimize the variance. We prove that the MRDR estimators are strongly consistent and asymptotically optimal. Finally, we evaluate MRDR in bandits and RL benchmark problems and compare its performance with the existing methods.
Adversarial Attack on Graph-Structured Data
Hajun Dai (Georgia Tech) · Hui Li (Ant Financial Services Group) · Tian Tian () · Xin Huang (Ant Financial) · Lin Wang () · Jun Zhu (Tsinghua University) · Le Song (Georgia Institute of Technology)
Abstract: Deep learning on graph structures has shown exciting results in various applications. However, little attention has been paid to the robustness of such models, in contrast to numerous research work for image or text adversarial attack and defense. In this paper, we focus on the adversarial attacks that fool the model by modifying the combinatorial structure of data. We first propose a reinforcement learning based attack method that learns the generalizable attack policy, while only requiring prediction labels from the target classifier. Also, variants of genetic algorithms and gradient methods are presented in the scenario where prediction confidence or gradients are available. We use both synthetic and real-world data to show that, a family of Graph Neural Network models is vulnerable to these attacks, in both graph-level and node-level classification tasks. We also show such attacks can be used to diagnose the learned classifiers.
Learn from Your Neighbor: Learning Multi-modal Mappings from Sparse Annotations
Ashwin Kalyan (Georgia Tech) · Stefan Lee (Georgia Institute of Technology) · Anitha Kannan (Curai) · Dhruv Batra (Georgia Institute of Technology / Facebook AI Research)
Abstract: Many structured prediction problems (particularly in vision and language domains) are ambiguous, with multiple outputs being ‘correct’ for an input – e.g. there are many ways of describing an image, multiple ways of translating a sentence; however, exhaustively annotating the applicability of all possible outputs is intractable due to exponentially large output spaces (e.g. all English sentences). In practice, these problems are cast as a multi-class prediction, with the likelihood of only a sparse set of annotations being maximized – unfortunately penalizing for placing beliefs on plausible but annotated outputs. We make and test the following hypothesis – for a given input, the annotations of its neighbors may serve as an additional supervisory signal. Specifically, we propose an objective that transfers supervision from neighboring examples. We first study the properties of our developed method in a controlled toy setup before reporting results on multi-label classification and two image-grounded sequence modeling tasks – captioning and question generation. We evaluate using standard task-specific metrics and measures of output diversity, finding consistent improvements over standard maximum likelihood training and other baselines.
Towards Black-box Iterative Machine Teaching
Weiyang Liu (Georgia Tech) · Bo Dai (Georgia Institute of Technology) · Xingguo Li (University of Minnesota) · Zhen Liu (Georgia Tech) · James Rehg (Georgia Tech) · Le Song (Georgia Institute of Technology)
Abstract: In this paper, we make an important step towards the black-box machine teaching by considering the cross-space machine teaching, where the teacher and the learner use different feature representations and the teacher cannot fully observe the learner's model. In such scenario, we study how the teacher is still able to teach the learner to achieve faster convergence rate than the traditional passive learning. We propose an active teacher model that can actively query the learner (i.e., make the learner take exams) for estimating the learner's status and demonstrably guide the learner to achieve faster convergence. The sample complexities for both teaching and query are provided. In the experiments, we compare the proposed active teacher with the omniscient teacher and verify the effectiveness of the active teacher model.
Learning Steady-States of Iterative Algorithms over Graphs
Hajun Dai (Georgia Tech) · Zornitsa Kozareva () · Bo Dai (Georgia Institute of Technology) · Alex Smola (Amazon) · Le Song (Georgia Institute of Technology)
Abstract: The design of good heuristics or approximation algorithms for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems often requires significant specialized knowledge and trial-and-error. Can we automate this challenging, tedious process and learn algorithms instead? In many real-world applications, it is typically the case that the same optimization problem is solved again and again on a regular basis, maintaining the same problem structure but differing in the data. This provides an opportunity for learning heuristic algorithms that exploit the structure of such recurring problems. In this paper, we propose a unique combination of reinforcement learning and graph-embedding to address this challenge. The learned greedy policy behaves like a meta-algorithm that incrementally constructs a solution, and the action is determined by the output of a graph embedding network capturing the current state of the solution. We show that our framework can be applied to a diverse range of optimization problems over graphs, and learns effective algorithms for the Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Cut and Traveling Salesman problems.
SBEED: Convergent Reinforcement Learning with Nonlinear Function Approximation
Bo Dai (Georgia Institute of Technology) · Albert Shaw (Georgia Tech) · Lihong Li (Microsoft Research) · Lin Xiao (Microsoft Research) · Niao He (UIUC) · Zhen Liu (Georgia Tech) · Jianshu Chen (Microsoft Research) · Le Song (Georgia Institute of Technology)
Abstract: When function approximation is used, solving the Bellman optimality equation with stability guarantees has remained a major open problem in reinforcement learning for decades. The fundamental difficulty is that the Bellman operator may become an expansion in general, resulting in oscillation and even divergent behavior of popular algorithms like Q-learning. In this paper, we revisit the Bellman equation, and reformulate it into a novel primal-dual optimization problem using Nesterov's smoothing technique and the Legendre-Fenchel transformation. We then develop a new algorithm, called Smoothed Bellman Error Embedding, to solve this optimization problem where any differentiable function class may be used. We provide what we believe to be the first convergence guarantee for general nonlinear function approximation, and analyze the algorithm's sample complexity. Empirically, our algorithm compares favorably to state-of-the-art baselines in several benchmark control problems.
Georgia Tech Researchers Show Easy Ways to Create Secure Passwords
Eight characters. One capital letter. A special character. A different password for each website. Remembering a new password is almost as challenging as creating one. Yet strong passwords are vitally important to keeping online information secure.
This is why Georgia Tech researchers have developed a method for users to generate secure passwords in their head without having to memorize them.
Human computation is the study of algorithms people can complete in their head. Developing secure passwords through human computation was first presented in a 2015 paper by School of Computer Science (SCS) Professor Santosh Vempala and Carnegie Mellon Professor Manuel Blum. Their paper introduced humanly computable password strategies and gave theoretical measures and analysis of their security and human usability.
But Adam Kalai, principal researcher at Microsoft Research New England, and SCS Ph.D. student Samira Samadi wanted to find a way to test these strategies on real people and make them easy to learn.
“There was still a big gap between these ideas being out there and whether an internet user would actually be able to adopt them,” Samadi said. “My field is in theory and machine learning, and whatever I do, I want to see if there can be a real-world impact.”
Creating a password strategy
With practicality in mind, Samadi worked with Kalai and Vempala to design a guide to help users through the process. The website presents three strategies users can try to craft passwords:
-
Letter Code Strategy: mapping letters to letters
-
Three Word Strategy: using three random words
-
Counting strategy: permuting five consonants and five vowels to generate words, and mapping these 10 letters to the 10 digits
For example, with the letter code strategy, a user would map the first 20 letters of the alphabet to 20 random consonants. Only using the first 20 letters is easier for memorization. If a website uses a letter from the last six letters (say Zillow), users can employ the “wildcard” letter of their choice.
To memorize this letter map, Samadi suggests coming up with words that use those two letters matched on their map. If the letters were “a” and” q,” users might think “aquarium.” Generating words for each combo will help users remember their map and then be able to come up with passwords quickly as needed.
To generate a password for a website, users take the name of the website and match it to their map. With Apple.com, a user would match each letter of the word “apple” to the corresponding letter on their map. If a password required a number or special character, users can append a fixed random combo, such as B7!.
In the three-word strategy, the user selects and memorizes a sequence of three random words. These implicitly create a letter code. To find the code for a letter, locate its first occurrence in the three chosen words and find the next consonant, as seen in the diagram.
Samadi designed a website where anyone can learn this and the other two password strategies via step-by-step instructions and informative videos. Coming up with a password strategy can take some effort for first-time users, but once they memorize a table or three words, they can generate passwords in seconds.
The researchers created a study to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the step-by-step instructions provided. For the letter-code strategy, it took users 21 minutes to learn the strategy and memorize a complete random letter code (13 minutes for the three-word strategy). The study found that after some practice, users could generate completely new passwords in under 20 seconds each.
The research was presented in the paper Usability of Human Computable Passwords, coauthored with Kalai and Vempala, at HCOMP 2018, the AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing in Zurich from July 5 to 8.
Georgia Tech Solves 'Texture Fill' Problem with Machine Learning
A new machine learning technique developed at Georgia Tech may soon give budding fashionistas and other designers the freedom to create realistic, high-resolution visual content without relying on complicated 3-D rendering programs.
TextureGAN is the first deep image synthesis method that can realistically spread multiple textures across an object. With this new approach, users drag one or more texture patches onto a sketch — say of a handbag or a skirt — and the network texturizes the sketch to accurately account for 3-D surfaces and lighting.
Prior to this work, producing realistic images of this kind could be tedious and time-consuming, particularly for those with limited experience. And, according to the researchers, existing machine learning-based methods are not particularly good at generating high-resolution texture details.
Using a neural network to improve results
“The ‘texture fill’ operation is difficult for a deep network to learn because it not only has to propagate the colors, but it also has to learn how to synthesize the structure of texture across 3-D shapes,” said Wenqi Xian, computer science (CS) major and co-lead developer.
[WATCH: Wenqi Xian presents Texture GAN at CVPR 2018]
The researchers initially trained a type of neural network called a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) on sketches and textures extracted from thousands of ground-truth photographs. In this approach, a generator neural network creates images that a discriminator neural network then evaluates for accuracy. The goal is for both to get increasingly better at their respective tasks, which leads to more realistic outputs.
To ensure that the results look as realistic as possible, researchers fine-tuned the new system to minimize pixel-to-pixel style differences between generated images and training data. But the results were not quite what the team had expected.
Producing more realistic images
“We realized that we needed a stronger constraint to preserve high-level texture in our outputs,” said Georgia Tech CS Ph.D. student Patsorn Sangkloy. “That’s when we developed an additional discriminator network that we trained on a separate texture dataset. Its only job is to be presented with two samples and ask ‘are these the same or not?’”
With its sole focus on a single question, this type of discriminator is much harder to fool. This, in turn, leads the generator to produce images that are not only realistic, but also true to the texture patch the user placed onto the sketch.
The work was presented in June at the conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2018 held in Salt Lake City and is funded through National Science Foundation award 1561968. School of Interactive Computing Associate Professor James Hays advises Xian and Sangkloy. Georgia Tech is collaborating on this research with Adobe Research, University of California at Berkeley, and Argo AI.
Georgia Tech Researchers and Community Collaborate in Data Science
Using data science to improve society is one of the biggest ethical trends in computing. However, it’s often used to increase efficiency — without asking what an individual community really needs. Georgia Tech researchers want to not only help communities, but involve them.
“When you’re doing careful data science, you do care about efficiency, but there are a lot of other values like residents’ voices in the data science process and then in the outcome of what the data gets used for,” said School of Computer Science (SCS) research scientist Amanda Meng.
Meeting a community
For three years, Meng and DiSalvo have worked with the Westside Atlanta Land Trust, an initiative of the nonprofit, HELP ORG, Inc., that has been trying to establish a community land trust. A community land trust is a nonprofit that owns the land while residents buy the buildings, enabling more accessibility and affordability. Yet before they can become a fully functioning community land trust, they must survey the land to catalog conditions of structures and vacant lots. In March and April 2017, a team of residents collected this data and plotted it on a map, with aid from Meng and SCS master’s student Tom Nguyen.
Having residents collect data is not only empowering for their community, but also leads to more accurate collection. It’s one of the fundamental concepts of Meng’s research with Zegura and DiSalvo on bringing the sociological concept of care — or the desire to address a need in the community — to data science.
“The residents know the area,” Meng said. “They are the best at collecting data on what’s changed.”
Working with a community
Collaborating with a community can be challenging for both parties. Researchers must build a relationship so the community trusts them. Meng has been attending community meetings for years and communicates extensively to make sure everyone understands the process.
Yet researchers also must rely on residents to attend data collection meetings, while meeting grant and paper deadlines. Researchers and residents also often have to collaboratively tinker with the data to ensure it’s as clean as possible, from matching street names to what’s in the Fulton County database to checking that each data point corresponds accurately to the map. The effort is worth it, though.
“It’s so rewarding being invited to walk the street with community members and being entrusted with this important goal of capturing changes in property conditions and values,” Meng said.
Meng, along with SCS Professor Ellen Zeugra and School of Literature, Media, and Communication Associate Professor Carl DiSalvo, presented their paper, Care and Practice of Data Science for Social Good, at the new ACM Conference on Computing and Sustainable Societies (COMPASS 2018) held in California from June 20 to 22. The new sustainable society and computing conference was co-organized by Zegura to bring together similar disciplines like computational sustainability and data science for social good.
SCS Ph.D. Student Karim Habak Finds Computing Solutions on the Edge
At any given moment, there are hundreds of underutilized computing devices at cafes, airports, and even on the Tech Trolley. A computer, tablet, or smartphone just sitting in someone’s pocket could be used to perform computations and significantly help others.
This is what Karim Habak, a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science, has been researching during his five years at Georgia Tech.
“There are resources at the edge, and we’re not using them,” Habak says.
Leveraging these existing resources to create a computing service is called edge or fog computing, and it is now one of the most vital and promising networking and computing concepts.
How stuff works
Breaking something down to see how it could work better has always been Habak’s approach to computer science, even as a child growing up in Alexandria, Egypt.
“Any toy I had as a kid, I would try to disassemble it and sometimes break it to figure out how it worked and then try reassemble it again,” he says.
When Habak got his first computer in 1996, he was more interested in making than playing computer games and believed he would go into game design. Yet as he started studying computer science at Alexandria University, he was drawn to distributed systems and networking for their hands-on approach to fixing computing problems.
“I like building things, playing with them, and seeing them work,” he says. “The kind of network problems I’ve been working on have allowed me to do that.”
During his master’s at Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology, Habak studied bandwidth aggregation, when he focused on enabling mobile devices to utilize their multiple network interfaces simultaneously. It was through this research that he came across the work of Professors Mostafa Ammar and Ellen Zegura in the networking field and knew he wanted to join them for his Ph.D.
On the edge
At Tech, Habak has researched mobile device clustering, or harnessing all the untapped computing power of these idle devices sitting in our bags on commutes and at cafes. These clusters are inherently unstable, so much of the research has involved predicting how long people stay together in one location or area of interest, a process called churn modeling.
“We’re trying to make a reliable service out of unreliable devices,” he says.
Habak came up with the femtocloud, a mobile self-configuring cloud made from a cluster of mobile devices that provides a reliable compute service despite the churn of its devices.
He will continue to explore this research when he joins Google’s Network and Infrastructure Team this summer.
“For a networking person, the biggest impact you can have is working for the biggest network.”
Using Data Science to Fix the Flint Water Crisis
The lead contamination in Flint’s drinking water is considered one of the biggest environmental crises of the recent years. Finding the locations of tens of thousands of lead pipes throughout the city seemed an insurmountable challenge to recovery efforts until a team of data scientists stepped in, including School of Computer Science Assistant Professor Jacob Abernethy.
What started as an attempt to save money by switching the Michigan city’s water supply from the Detroit system to the Flint River in 2014 led to contaminated water and international outcry by 2016. Lead wasn’t coming from the water itself, but the lead service lines that connected Flint homes to the city’s water system.
The problem was no one knew how many homes were affected. Flint hadn’t complied with Environmental Protection Agency standards to keep records of lead service lines. With as many as 50,000 homes potentially needing service line replacements, the city was facing costs up to $250 million. Flint officials were granted only $27 million from the state legislature and an additional $100 million from the U.S. government toward recovery efforts.
Google believed data science could expedite the process of identifying specific homes in need of replacement service lines and donated to the University of Michigan and Flint’s Community Foundation. Abernethy, then an assistant professor at the Ann Arbor campus, and his Data Science Team of students were called in.
Deciding with data
By aggregating a mix of datasets — including pipe material information, parcel records, U.S. census reports, city infrastructure maps, and water samples — Abernethy and his team took advantage of a machine learning technique known as active learning in order to determine which homes were most likely to have lead service lines.
The algorithm performed three processes simultaneously: a statistical model that predicted which portion of the service line was lead, copper, or otherwise; a decision procedure that randomly generated homes for inspection; and a decision-making algorithm that chose which homes should have lines replaced.
Using the predictive model allowed better targeting of resources. Had this method been fully utilized throughout the replacement process, the team estimates that the city could have saved over $10 million — enough money to replace pipes at 2,000 more homes, according Abernethy. The team also created a web-based mobile application to help government offices, residents, and contractors coordinate efforts and update their data in real-time.
Working with a community
Having access to all of this data, as well as numerous algorithmic tools, did not mean that all could be easily implemented on the ground in Flint. Every service line replacement had to be approved by the Flint City Council, and, according to Abernethy, university academics are not always appreciated in towns with struggling economies.
“You write these papers that have these abstract things like, ‘Here’s the way to optimize this whole procedure to save money,’ but what we proposed would take changing large bureaucratic structures and procedures,” Abernethy said. “These interventions are not always welcome.”
Yet the relationship went both ways. For most of the team, this was the first time their research had such a direct impact on a community. Abernethy recalled a city council meeting when a councilwoman asked if her home’s water pipes could be replaced next so that her grandchildren could have safe water to drink.
“It was very touching and moving to have this interaction when we had been thinking of this as an optimization problem,” Abernethy said. “It brought home what we were doing. This is great we’re helping someone like you, but this woman may not have her pipes replaced because of some line in my code. For me, personally, the stakes went up after this conversation.”
Abernethy considers his work in Flint to be one of the most rewarding and challenging of his career.
“If we had picked a project that didn’t have this much public attention, we probably would’ve just written a paper and given up and not done anything useful,” he said. “This was an issue where we had the incentives to go in and do this work very thoughtfully and deeply and really make a difference. I’m really proud of that, and feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to engage in such an important issue.”
Abernethy presents the research in the paper, Active Remediation: The Search for Lead Pipes in Flint, Michigan, coauthored with University of Michigan faculty and students including Assistant Professor of Marketing Eric Schwartz, Alex Chojnacki, Arya Farahi, and Brigham Young University Ph.D. student Jared Webb. The work won the best student paper at the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conference in London from August 19-23.
School of Computer Science Researchers Prevent Denial of Service Attacks
Georgia Tech School of Computer Science (SCS) researchers have developed a proactive defense tool that can identify and prevent denial of service (DoS) attacks.
Typically, DoS attacks shut down web applications by sending too many access requests to a server. Now, more sophisticated, a single complex attack request can render a website unusable and be impossible to detect.
Rampart, the new defense tool developed at Georgia Tech, is designed to counter these DoS advances. It models all access requests to see how many resources they use then builds a statistical model from the data. When a new request arrives, Rampart verifies it against the statistical model to detect suspicious run times that deviate from the average. Any suspicious request will be cancelled or temporarily suspended to ensure it doesn’t take over the web application.
If Rampart detects a true attack, it deploys a filtering rule to block any similar suspicious requests. To ensure legitimate users aren’t affected, Rampart removes the filter once the attack ends and periodically reevaluates all filters and deactivates any false positives.
Whereas the traditional detection mechanisms passively report vulnerabilities, requiring developers to manually fix them in each development, Rampart offers an immediate solution.
“Rampart is a real-time defense mechanism that does not require the source code to prevent sophisticated CPU-exhaustion attacks,” said SCS Ph.D. student Chenxiong Qian. “Rampart demonstrates the possibility of the proactive defense mechanism, which we think is a good alternative that the security industry can adopt.”
The researchers recommend applying Rampart along with other existing network-based defense mechanisms to protect web servers.
Rampart was presented at USENIX in the paper, Rampart: Protecting Web Applications from CPU-Exhaustion Denial-of-Service Attacks, by SCS’s Qian and Professor Wenke Lee; Chinese University of Hong Kong and Tech alumnus Wei Meng; University of Texas at Dallas’s Shuang Hao; and University of California, Santa Barbara’s Kevin Borgolte, Giovanni Vigna, and Christopher Kruegel.
GT Computing Adds Record Number of Tenure-Track Faculty
To keep pace with continuing growth, the College of Computing has hired a record number of new tenure-track faculty members for the 2018/19 academic year.
Following on-campus interviews with candidates from around the country earlier this year, 11 new academics have been hired. These new faculty members specialize in a variety of disciplines – including artificial intelligence, algorithms, cybersecurity, machine learning, high-performance computing, and robotics. Last year, 10 new faculty members joined the GT Computing community.
“As our growth continues to skyrocket it is more important than ever to hire the best and the brightest,” said John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing Zvi Galil. “We are very fortunate to be bringing aboard such a distinguished cohort of new faculty members. Their respective reputations for excellence in teaching and research are well-known and they are all highly regarded experts in their fields.”
The dozen new faculty members are split between the schools of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), Computer Science (CS), and Interactive Computing (IC). The School of CSE is welcoming Assistant Professor Chao Zhang. Joy Arulraj, Alexandros Daglis, David Devecsery, Paul Pearce, and Qirun Zhang are joining the School of CS ranks as assistant professors. New faculty members in the School of IC include Associate Professor Carl DiSalvo and Assistant Professors Zsolt Kira, Matthew Gombolay, Judy Hoffman, and Diyi Yang. Although not technically a new hire for GT Computing, the School of IC is also welcoming HyunJoo Oh, who has a joint appointment in IC and the School of Industrial Design.

Dana Randall Named External Faculty at Santa Fe Institute Configure
College of Computing Professor Dana Randall has been named an external faculty member at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI).
SFI is a non-profit independent research center that brings together top academic researchers from the U.S. and abroad.
As an external faculty member, Randall will virtually collaborate with other researchers. She will contribute her experience and expertise in theoretical computer science, as well as her research in randomized algorithms and stochastic processes in computer science, discrete mathematics, and statistical physics.
“No aspect of science is going to continue the way it was. New ways of analyzing and integrating the massive datasets being generated in most fields of science and engineering are transforming those disciplines and challenging long-held notions about what can be accomplished,” Randall said in an interview with GT Computing in 2017.
Randall, who is co-executive director of Georgia Tech's Institute for Data Engineering and Science, is one of 10 external faculty members selected this year by SFI. In all, SFI has more than 100 external faculty members from across a variety of disciplines.
SFI's news release states, “Randall is widely recognized as an expert. Some of her recent work has been dedicated to creating mathematical models for phase transitions and emergent phenomena. Her approaches can be used to understand how organisms flock, how neighborhoods self-segregate, and how swarms of ants or robots can move as one.”
Randall is also the ADVANCE Professor of Computing and an adjunct professor in the School of Mathematics at Georgia Tech.
New Associate Chair Alexandra Boldyreva Co-chairs Biggest Cryptography Conference
School of Computer Science Associate Professor Alexandra Boldyreva recently served as program co-chair for one of largest cryptography conferences in the world.
Up to 640 people registered for the Crypto conference in Santa Barbara, California. The August event had the largest attendance in its 37-year history. The program included academic talks, as well as new workshops for industry professionals.
Crypto started in 1981 and was the first academic cryptography conference. Boldyreva has been attending the annual event since 1999. She found out in spring of 2017 that the International Association for Cryptographic Research selected her as co-chair for the 2018 and 2019 conferences.
She and her co-chair, University of Texas at Austin Professor Hovav Shacham, wanted 2018’s conference to have the best papers in the most interesting areas with a good balance of theoretical and practical research.
“When the public hears cryptography, they think of cryptocurrency, but it’s so much more than that,” Boldyreva said. “It’s this growing need for security everywhere, and cryptography is part of that.”
The conference received 351 paper submissions and accepted 79. Novel research advances in the following areas were presented: rncryption and authentication, secure messaging and key exchange protocols, protection against subversion, backdoors and physical attacks, cryptanalysis, searchable encryption, differential privacy, secure multiparty computation, zero knowledge, oblivious RAM, quantum and post-quantum cryptography, and program obfuscation.
New school role
Boldyreva also recently took on a new role in SCS, now serving as the associate chair for graduate education. In her three-year appointment, Boldyreva will manage the SCS Ph.D. program, aid new students with orientation, supervise admission and review processes, and assign teaching assistants.
Although H. Venkateswaran held the position since January 2014, Boldyreva has advised the master’s in cybersecurity before and felt like the position was a natural fit.
“Since doing my Ph.D., I have always felt closer to Ph.D. students and wanted to help our department.”
Jamie Morgenstern Wants to Bring Fairness to Machine Learning
Machine learning is used in almost every decision these days. It can help banks to find good lending candidates, employers to find qualified job applicants, and marketers to find to the right message. Local governments also rely on machine learning systems to allocate limited resources like police presence and social services.
Although automating these processes improves how quickly decisions are made, it can also exacerbate existing inequities. Machine learning models find patterns in historical data and use those to predict future patterns. If a certain population had more historical access to some resources (such as mortgages), a machine learning algorithm can identify this trend and try to replicate it in future decisions, thereby tilting things to that population's advantage.
This problem is something School of Computer Science Assistant Professor Jamie Morgenstern thinks about a lot. The entire machine learning pipeline needs to be scrutinized, from data gathering and cleaning to learning the model and deploying it.
Bridging the gap between economics and computer science
This application of game theory to economics has always interested Morgenstern, but it wasn’t until she took a computer science course in her sophomore year at the University of Chicago that she found the right outlet for it.
“I liked the implications of the theorems that showed how to solve problems that had some relation to the real world in computationally efficient ways,” she said.
One of these real-world problems is how to think about economics with limited data. Economists tend to believe the world has a perfect data distribution, and people behave rationally in their environments. Computer scientists, however, often operate with a worst-case scenario mindset and recognize people never have a perfect description of their environment — just historical data on it.
“Reasoning about strategic and worst-case behavior both is an interesting way to look at the world and find solutions,” Morgenstern said. “Neither is perfect, but both are useful models in different settings.”
For Morgenstern, machine learning is an ideal bridge between the two schools of thought because it allows generalizations about economic problems despite imperfect information. Morgenstern studied the social impact of machine learning, as well as the impact of social behavior on machine learning, during her Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University, where she was advised by renowned theorist Professor Avrim Blum.
Making machine learning fair
Fairness in machine learning is a relatively new area in an already burgeoning field, yet it’s important as the concept gains more popularity.
“The question is how should you make sure you aren’t over-tailoring the information you’re finding from this limited data while still learning?” Morgenstern said.
Morgenstern joined the SCS faculty in Spring 2018, choosing Georgia Tech for its reputation as a theoretical computer science hub ideal for the type of research she does.
[READ: Ethics Highlight 'Day of Machine Learning Discussion']
Her current work focuses on measuring how suboptimal data affects machine learning. A central goal of her work is to ensure machine learning makes the world a more equitable, ethical place rather than further entrenching historical injustices.
“I’ve always cared about social justice and the idea that we should make our systems more equitable and not profitable.”

Georgia Tech Provost Rafael L. Bras has named a committee chair for a search committee tasked with determining the next dean for the College of Computing.
The search will fill the vacancy that will be left by College of Computing Dean Zvi Galil, who will step down on June 30, 2019.
[RELATED: Dean Galil to Step Down After Next Academic Year]
Raheem Beyah, Motorola Foundation Professor and Associate Chair of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, will chair the international search for the new GT Computing dean. The individual selected by this search committee will also hold the John P. Imlay Jr. Chair.
A search committee for a new dean of the Georgia Tech College of Sciences was also recently announced.
"The Colleges of Computing and Sciences are doing very well and have tremendous momentum,” Bras said. “The next deans will have the opportunity to lead an extraordinary group of staff, students, and faculty in their commitment to excellence, innovation in education and research, and leadership in higher education.”
A town hall meeting for faculty, staff, and students interested in learning about the search process and timeline, and to provide feedback on the characteristics of ideal candidates, has been scheduled for Oct. 2 at 11 a.m. in Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons, Room 152.
Applications and nominations for both dean positions can be sent to provostsoffice@gatech.edu. While applications and nominations will be received until the dean is selected, interested parties are encouraged to respond by Nov. 21 to ensure optimal consideration.
Associate Provost for Operations Jennifer Herazy will serve as search director for both searches. A full position description for the dean of Computing search, along with a search committee roster, and ongoing search updates can be found at provost.gatech.edu/dean-computing.
OMSCS Subject of Research into Wearable Tech in Online Learning
A team of researchers in the School of Interactive Computing (IC) and the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program will investigate the feasibility of using wearable technologies and other types of sensing data to provide context in online learning environments.
This is the first funded project that uses OMSCS as a test bed.
Under a $300,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, IC Assistant Professor Lauren Wilcox, along with co-principal investigators Betsy DiSalvo (IC), Thomas Ploetz (IC), and David Joyner (OMSCS), will set up an infrastructure for using wearable technology and interaction analytics to capture students’ experiences with online courses. They will also investigate which personal interactive computing technologies are effective in capturing and modeling context, and what correlations exist between wearable data, analytics from online behavior, self-reports of stress and anxiety and learning outcomes. The initial aim is to determine if the use of wearable technologies could better inform online course delivery, and improve retention and learning outcomes.
“When we are instructing online courses, we lose an important view into the student experience,” Wilcox said. “Some students might be paying attention while others aren’t. Some might be paying attention, but they still aren’t learning. We want to better understand these scenarios and use our knowledge of them to inform better online learning experiences.”
“Analyzing data from wearables worn by students during online course instruction could help us understand and recognize these scenarios,” Ploetz added.
Such a study may not be possible at the vast majority of research institutions, but the presence of the OMSCS program at Georgia Tech affords a unique opportunity. Because of the high volume of participation and enrollment, not to mention the number of quality dedicated professors, the researchers expect to establish reliable conclusions and create a foundation for future research
“We think the OMSCS program is a strong test bed for this research because students are motivated to succeed and course completion rates are very high, and yet the course content and assessments remain extremely rigorous,” said Joyner, the associate director of student experience in the College of Computing and a longtime lecturer for OMSCS.
“These students experience the same stress, engagement, discouragement, and triumph as traditional students, but online instructors cannot see these states. Wearable technologies may help identify when these states occur and whether they correlate to desirable learning outcomes.”
The project is a two-year study during which the researchers will establish ground truth on student success and satisfaction. Are they generally happy? Do they disengage or pay greater attention to a specific lecture? What events trigger indicators of stress or anxiety, and at what point is that detrimental to learning?
“The idea is not to provide data on individuals to instructors,” Wilcox said, addressing concerns of student privacy. “First, we hope to see whether we can collect these data points, understand what they might mean for learning, and then provide anonymous aggregated feedback to instructors. It’s also about how we can help adapt these learning experiences to the individual students.”
Down the road, it could also be an important test bed for things like test anxiety or understanding what a flow state – or, colloquially, being “in the zone” – looks like and what features of a lecture lend themselves to it.
“One of the most exciting aspects of deploying this type of research in OMSCS is the potential scale for future research,” DiSalvo said. “This grant is laying the groundwork for future research on designing learning, building upon theories of learning with design-based research both at a scale and with detail of individual behavior and feedback that we have not had access to in the past.”
While the initial applications of this approach are in online courses, access to this type of data could be used to design many new learning environments.
“With just-in-time feedback to the students, we could provide customized learning that really moves away from the traditional class structure,” DiSalvo said.
Beyond learning, with more and more aspects of daily life going online, Wilcox said that she could also see implications of the findings from this study influencing the design of other online environments, such as job training.
“The ultimate goal is to create online learning environments that promote positive human interactions and consider human health and wellness an integral part of the design,” she said.
Assistant Professor Xu Chu Wants to Make Data Analytics Accessible
Data analytics are widely used in science domains, government entities, and commercial organization. But they are only effective if the data is clean and easy to use. This is where database researchers like Xu Chu come in.
Chu joined the School of Computer Science as an assistant professor in Spring 2018 to research concerns like this.
“Valuable insights can be gained by analyzing relevant data, but there are a lot of steps to go through for that to happen,” Chu said. These include data preprocessing, such as data curation, data cleaning, and feature engineering and selection, and data post-processing, such as model interpretation and evaluation, and model maintenance.
Discovering databases
Chu first found databases in the third year of his undergraduate degree at Nanjing University in China. He didn’t really delve into the research, though, until he studied abroad at the University of Waterloo, a Canadian computer science department known for its database expertise.
Chu was so engrossed by the practical problems in data management that he decided to complete his Ph.D. at Waterloo, too. His graduate study focused on various ways to do data cleaning, from rule-based approaches to advanced statistical and learning-based approaches.
“Errors can happen in various forms, so there’s not really one solution that solves all problems,” he said. “I am looking at more holistic solutions.”
Mixing ML and databases
Data cleaning is just one of the many painful steps users have to go through to do data analytics. Chu is building a research team to develop algorithms, tools, and systems to make the entire data analytics pipeline more usable and accessible, in particular the machine learning pipeline.
“Every step needs human attention, and every step is difficult if you don’t have the right tools,” Chu said.
Building these diverse tools for analytics requires being an expert in more than just databases. Other than a database course and a data mining course in his undergraduate years, Chu had to research the area on his own, which is something he brings to his teaching of a graduate course.
For every class, he provides an overview of the topic, but then tasks his students to research the technical details to the point where they know it better than he does. He wants to teach them more than just database knowledge, but the study skills for any future research they might pursue.
“I am a strong believer in picking a right problem, and learning whatever is necessary to solve it,” he said. “Students should not be afraid of anything.”
Georgia Tech Student Improves Performance of User File Systems
Georgia Tech Ph.D. student Ashish Bijlani has found a way to make Linux user file systems faster.
User file systems are how operating systems organize files. They are easy to develop, maintain, and debug, but they’re so slow that the weak performance almost cancels out the benefits.
Bijlani’s ExtFUSE extension uses Linux’s extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) kernel-extension framework to speed up Linux’s File System in Userspace, or FUSE. eBPF inserts customizable code into the kernel that can improve performance and security needs.
The project started last September when Bijlani was using FUSE file systems in his own research but found them too slow for his needs. He knew eBPF could optimize a framework and decided to experiment with FUSE.
[RELATED: Uninitialized-Use ‘Bugs’ May Provide Portal for Hacker Attacks]
“I had been reading about eBPF and thought this would be a good way to make FUSE file systems faster,” he said.
Bijlani knew the research would be worthwhile from the start because optimizing the framework would automatically improve hundreds of applications that used it. He presented the ExtFUSE research at Open Source Summit, an industry convention presented by the Linux Foundation, in Vancouver in August, where its widespread applicability garnered some industry attention from eBPF developers.
It may have started as a side project but complements his dissertation research on how to design a novel mobile storage architecture. For Bijlani, ExtFUSE has been a solo project so far without any industry support or research grants. However, he is open to the possibility and would like to collaborate with other researchers. He hopes to apply the extension to a number of domains built on FUSE and compile the results for an academic paper.
Georgia Tech Researchers Develop AI That Can Create Entirely New Games
The first machine learning-based automated game design tool from a team of researchers at Georgia Tech could empower anyone to make their own games. Utilizing what the researchers dub “conceptual expansion,” the method recombines machine-learned models of games into new, playable games.
Prior automated game design approaches have used hand-authored or crowd-sourced knowledge, which requires a human author to write instructions for the system to produce games. This approach, however, limits the scope and applications of such systems, according to the Georgia Tech team.
Conceptual expansion, on the other hand, takes in an arbitrary number of games – Super Mario Bros., Kirby’s Adventure, and Mega Man, for example – and then outputs original games with unique mechanics and level designs.
“By having this done using machine learning, it doesn’t require me or anyone else to author additional content,” said Matthew Guzdial, a Ph.D. student in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing (IC) and the lead on the project. “I can just give it a new game to learn on, and it will immediately change its output based on what it sees. If I want a game like Pong and game like Tetris, I show two videos to the system and, bam, here are 30 games or however many it comes up with.”
This research builds on previous work by the team, which includes Guzdial’s adviser, IC Associate Professor Mark Riedl. That work attempted to empower artificial intelligence (AI) with creativity through the use of video games. Past iterations have looked at learning level design for a game – Super Mario Bros., for example – but this led to output levels very similar to those already in the game.
In an alternative method, the researchers drew on an approach called conceptual blending that allowed them to create entirely new types of levels, like underwater castles, which aren’t present in the original franchise.
The latest work has used that foundation to produce entirely new content, though challenges still exist, Guzdial said.
“What we have to do now is define some way for the AI to know what is good and what is bad,” he said. “That’s the trick. We haven’t quite figured it out yet. We’ve gotten some bad stuff out, too.”
Some examples: An enemy was invented that couldn’t move and couldn’t die and a power-up that moved further away any time a player was within a certain distance.
“So, those aren’t great,” Guzdial said. “There’s no intentionality there. It’s frustrating, but it’s interesting to see how it builds these new relationships. At the end of the day, right now, we are looking for something new and something playable. Have I ever seen this before, and can I actually play this game?”
The goal, Guzdial said, is not to replace human game designers but to provide non-game designers with the ability to produce original content on their own. He’s often heard others describe games as being a combination of multiple games they’ve played before.
“Why not empower them with the ability to create on their own?” he said. “I have no illusions about whether experts can make a better game than this engine, obviously. But can we let people who don’t know how to make games become developers on their own?”
This research is published in a paper titled Automated Game Design via Conceptual Expansion, which will be presented at the 14th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment on Nov. 13-17 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
College of Computing Students Find Community at Grace Hopper
A group of 55 College of Computing students celebrated women in computing for the 24th annual Grace Hopper Celebration, Sept. 26–28 in Houston, Texas.
Organized by the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology and the Association for Computing Machinery, the three-day conference is the largest gathering of women technologists in the world with more than 20,000 attendees this year. Academics, industry partners, and students come for the technical and professional development panels, mentoring sessions, and a career fair where companies and universities recruit.
The College of Computing had a strong presence with 24 undergraduates, six master’s students, five Ph.D. students, and 20 online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) students in attendance.
Many prominent faculty also represented the College, including Executive Associate Dean Charles Isbell, School of Interactive Computing Chair Ayanna Howard, and School of Computer Science Associate Professor Ada Gavrilovska. Howard co-led a session on professional branding, Building Your Professional Persona, during which she gave five tips on how to network better.
As a platinum-level sponsor, the College had a booth for prospective students run by Office of Outreach, Enrollment and Community and faculty. A College scholarship enabled many students to attend, from those just starting their academic careers to those looking for what comes after. First-year student Salina Nihalani took advantage of the technical panels to help her focus her studies.
“I would definitely recommend attending as a freshman because sometimes you aren’t sure about what you want to study, and it’s a great way to gain exposure to research areas you may not know,” she said, taking a particular interest in artificial intelligence thanks to the conference.
Fourth-year Dina Kozlov is graduating this semester and was looking for jobs at GHC, where she found a lot of opportunity without the downsides of competition.
“Everyone is so nice that it doesn’t feel like a competitive, aggressive space,” she said. “We’re all just here to make the world a better place.”
Yet for OMSCS students, it was a chance to do a different type of networking. “It’s been exciting because it’s the first time I’ve met people from the program in person,” said Anne Chepkeitany, a first-year OMSCS student, who traveled all the way from Nairobi, Kenya, to attend.
It also lets students put the classes in context. “It’s neat to hear keywords I’ve learned about in class on the machine learning panels,” said OMSCS student Kate Reading.
Yet for many students, what mattered most wasn’t sessions or career opportunities, but the chance to be around by so many women in their field.
“I wanted to be surrounded by empowering women,” said fourth-year Devany Sandoval. “Hearing their side of the story reminds me that I have a good support system.”
Mostafa Ammar is Studying the History of the Internet to Find Its Future
What is the future of the internet? This is a question School of Computer Science Professor Mostafa Ammar has been asking himself a lot lately, and he’s been looking to the past to figure it out.
Since 2015, he has been traveling around the world, from Colorado to Stockholm to Qatar, to deliver talks on the history of the internet and the challenges it faces now. Ammar may be a networking researcher by trade, but he has been reading history books for years and thought it was about time someone applied that framework to networks.
“Structure can help us understand the future,” Ammar said. “We can learn why things happened the way they did or see if there are lessons from other disciplines whose history happened before ours. That’s the kind of thing I think we’re missing in computer science.”
The earliest network
Ammar has been studying networks since his Ph.D. at University of Waterloo during the 1980s, when the field was just taking shape.
“At that time, we were thinking more like engineers, thinking hard about problems, laying foundations, then designing something and living with it,” he said. “When you design a car, it’s on the road for 10 to 15 years. It takes a while for artifacts to catch up with technology.”
The academic research networks that became the internet grew too quickly for this type of thinking, though. They were originally designed to enable people to access the few mainframes in the country because computers were so expensive and rare at the time. But no one really understood how people would practically use these networks.
Early innovations were rather mundane. When people started leaving messages for each other on the network, email was born. Just as these early networks grew to meet the demand for email, the internet – a network of networks – has been rearranging itself around whatever budding technology is currently taking up the most traffic. It may have been email in the 1980s, but today more than half of the internet is used for video streaming.
The ever-expanding network
Yet expanding the internet to account for new applications isn’t as simple as designing a patch. To change one thing locally, it must be implemented globally. This requires a lot of people to agree on new standards and deploy them, something that has become even more difficult as the internet grows.
One example of the difficulty in adopting new standards is the use of internet protocol (IP) addresses. From its inception, the internet has relied on 32-bit numbers that locate interfaces, enabling users to connect to the network. In the early 1990s, there was concern that these 32-bit IP addresses would run out. By the late 1990s, a new IP standard that used 128-bit addresses was developed. However, it took well over a decade for this new standard to start seeing any meaningful deployment; only when the original 32-bit addresses ran out did it get adopted out of sheer necessity. It’s not the 128-bit address that makes this complicated, but rather the transition technology that enables the new standard to co-exist with the still-dominant old one.
This is just one challenge. In the early days, there were many networks and networking technologies. Over the years, there has been a consolidation of most, if not all, networked services into a single network, the internet. But Ammar thinks that the time for a single network for all services may have passed.
“We’re scientists, but we have a lot of religious beliefs within our domain, and one belief is: There shall be one big network shared by everyone, and it shall deliver everything: video, Facebook, email, documents,” Ammar said. Yet he thinks this singular network belief is actually weakening the internet because it makes deploying new standards even harder due to the network’s scale, a concept referred to as network ossification.
“The internet can be considered the immovable object, but user growth and new application demands are an unstoppable force,” Ammar said. “What happens when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object?” In this case, Ammar believes, the force is actually more powerful because it has real users, real applications, and real money that want things done.
The new networks
Ammar believes that this confrontation has resulted in the beginning of the fragmentation of the internet. Already some companies build bypass networks, or networks completely separate from the main internet. Others create networks where the user’s view of the internet is limited to their content provider network, effectively carving out a part of the network for the content provider. He conjectures that this fragmentation will continue to increase and will be the way the internet responds to new service demands and increased scale.
“One problem is that our research and teaching continues to focus on the traditional ‘one network’ paradigm,” Ammar said. “The networking community should start thinking about how our research and teaching should be changed to reflect this fragmented networking reality and how our research efforts can help give us an orderly transition to this new ‘many networks’ world.”
Professor Tim Roughgarden Delivers Distinguished Lecture on How CS Solved One of the Hardest Government Auction Problems
Professor Tim Roughgarden gave the fall distinguished lecture for the School of Computer Science on Friday, Oct. 5. The theory talk, How Computer Science Informs Modern Auction Design, engaged the many faculty and students who attended.
Roughgarden is a professor at Stanford, where he specializes in computer science and economics, focusing on design, analysis, applications, and limitations of algorithms. He used a specific auction as a case study of how computer science is influencing economics more and more.
From 2016 to 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) hosted an auction to free up traditional broadcast licenses for broadband development. This would enable a stronger network for computers, tablets, and smartphones.
To repurpose the wireless spectrum, the FCC hosted reverse and forward auctions. Initially, the FCC spent $10 billion buying spectrum licenses from regional broadcast TV stations. Then it planned a forward auction to sell wireless broadband licenses for $20 billion. Overall, the auction would net $10 million in revenue. Yet to make all the math work, they needed to use computer science.
For the reverse auction, the FCC relied on a descending clock option algorithm. Each broadcaster was offered a buyout price that decreased over time in each round. If a broadcaster declined the offer, they would be exited from the auction and would retain the original license with no government compensation. However, if the broadcaster accepted the offer, they would move to the next around with the expectation that the government would eventually buy back their license and pay the most recent lower offer.
Yet, according to Roughgarden, the central problem with this auction format was a more classic theory problem. The FCC needed to buy up a certain number of licenses nationwide to be successful, but those that remained needed to have channels the government could reassign them to. This is a classic mathematical repacking problem.
What the FCC needed was a solution to one of the most famous NP-complete problems, graph coloring. Graph coloring assigns labels (colors) to graph vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. To make it even harder, this auction necessitated solving thousands of graph coloring problems within a second.
“NP isn’t a death sentence, but you have to up your game,” Roughgarden said.
Computer scientists used what are known as “satisfiability” algorithms to come up with the best prediction for how a channel would behave, and if they could be repacked during the auction. Surprisingly, the best method for solving this, explained Roughgarden, was using reverse greedy algorithms, which delete edges from graphs.
“It’s not like no one ever thought about reverse greedy algorithms, but it didn’t seem like anyone cared,” Roughgarden said. “Because why use them when they seem more awkward and less good? But coming from economics, there is an extrinsic reason to care about what you can do with a reverse greedy algorithm.”
For the forward auction when the FCC needed to sell broadband licenses, Roughgarden noted how the FCC relied on the computer science concept of proof of anarchy to prove that simple auctions work well without complements. Similarly, complexity theory was able to explain why strong complements make simple auctions perform poorly.
“Without techniques from computer science, the government could not have used the auction they did.”
Government and Corporate Responsibility the Focus of 2018 Cybersecurity Summit
Cyberwarfare increasingly crosses international borders, affecting diplomacy, the global economy, and privacy of citizens. Governments and corporations must set new frameworks to defend against nation-state attacks.
This issue was the focus of the Institute for Information Security and Privacy’s (IISP) Cybersecurity Summit, featuring the Sam Nunn Bank of America Policy Forum, on Oct. 4. More than 270 cybersecurity academics and professionals attended the 16th annual event. IISP Associate Director of Policy Peter Swire organized this year’s policy focus. The combined event was due in part to the generosity of sponsors — including Bank of America for the Nunn Policy Forum, and Jones Day, Turner, and ADP for the Cybersecurity Summit.
Andy Ozment, a College of Computing alumnus and chief information security officer at Goldman Sachs and former secretary for cybersecurity at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, delivered the keynote, In the Crosshairs: When You're the Target of Nation-State Cyberattacks. His expertise in both government and corporate security set the tone for the day as he advocated for “reasonable cybersecurity.”
“If a sovereign adversary is willing to take a year of their time and thousands of their people, I can’t keep them from breaking in,” he said. “You need to think about resilience strategies.”
He suggested both companies and governments need to track threat environments to prevent attacks. Although the government can’t help every company, it can concentrate resources on certain areas and set a precedent to deter attacks.
“The more expertise the government can share the better,” he said. “I don’t have a way of changing attackers’ behavior, but the government does.”
Senator Sam Nunn, a champion of cybersecurity policy and research, also made remarks. He is focused on issues of cyberwarfare, effective deterrence, cyber offense, attribution, the role of the private sector in working with the government, and cyber understandings with other countries to restrain attacks.
"I'm very proud of the role Georgia Tech is playing in security," he said.
Nunn’s remarks led well into the first panel on how governments can better protect against cyberwarfare, The Elephant in the Room: Cyberwarfare is War on the Economy, moderated by Annie Antón, IISP’s associate director of privacy engineering and School of Interactive Computing professor. The panel included:
- Michèle Flournoy, co-founder and managing partner, WestExec Advisors; former undersecretary of defense policy, U.S. Department of Defense
- Rick Ledgett, advisor, fellow, and trustee; former deputy director, National Security Agency
- Michael Morell, advisor and author; chairman of the National Security Task Force, U.S. Chamber of Commerce; former acting director and deputy director, Central Intelligence Agency
- Niloofar Razi Howe, technology investor, executive and entrepreneur; recently chief strategy officer and senior vice president of strategy and operations, RSA
The discussion centered on deterrence and how governments could effectively deter nation-state attacks without compromising security.
“We’re in a deep deterrence hole,” Flournoy said. “State sponsors of cyberattacks have come to believe they can attack our core democratic processes, and we will do nothing. The first order of business is to try to reestablish some measure of deterrence in cyberspace.”
Just before lunch IISP Co-Executive Directors, Michael Farrell, principal researcher at GTRI, and Wenke Lee, Imlay Chair and professor in the School of Computer Science, presented an award to r00timentary for their capture the flag (CTF) victory at this year’s DEFCON conference. r00timentary team members include Assistant Professor Taesoo Kim and his Ph.D. students Insu Yun, Wen Xu, Soyeon Park, Jinho Jung, master’s student Po-ning Tseng, and alumnus Yeongjin Jang.
The afternoon panel, Who’s Wearing Your Flak Jacket? Corporate Defense for Nation-State Attacks, emphasized corporate responses to cyberattacks. Moderated by Sam Nunn School of International Affairs distinguished professor and Admiral Sandy Winnefeld, it included:
- Jim Harvey, partner, Alston & Bird LLC; co-Chair of Cybersecurity Preparedness and Response; leader, Data Privacy and Security
- David Kris, founder, Culper Partners LLC; former assistant attorney general for national security, U.S. Department of Justice; former deputy general counsel, chief ethics and compliance officer, Time Warner Inc.
- Tony Scott, former chief information officer, U.S. Government, VMware, Walt Disney Company; former chief technology officer, General Motors Information Systems & Services
The panel broke down how to find vulnerabilities in a company and why it’s so important for the government and corporations to work together.
"The relationship between government and private sector regarding cybersecurity ebbs and flows,” Kris said. “Private companies generally don’t want the Feds in their network, but increasingly see the benefits from engaging DHS and, when needed, the FBI. From the government side, they're puzzled that some of these companies tell the public about an advanced persistent threat first." Enhanced information and threat sharing was highlighted as critically important for defending against nation-state attacks.
The summit also included a “Two-Minute Madness” session, when students took the stage for short presentations on their cybersecurity research. This was followed by a poster session showcasing student research, where event participants engaged students in Q&A.

All of this was a part of IISP’s annual Demo Day festivities, in which students compete for cash prizes and potential follow-up support to take their research to the next level. The top three teams walked away with a combined total of $10,000 in prize money after a popular vote from all participants determined the winner. An expert panel of local chief information security officers (CISOs) selected the second and third-place winners. A bonus award was given to a team of student researchers, giving them automatic entry into Tech’s exciting Create-X program, an initiative to instill entrepreneurial confidence in students and empower them to launch real startups.
The event ended with breakout sessions on FinTech, smart cities, and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity.
- FinTech: Cybersecurity Risk in Financial Services and FinTech explored cybersecurity and regulatory considerations for FinTech companies, financial exchanges, payment processors, banks, and other financial services companies.
- Moderated by Georgia Tech’s Sudheer Chava, with cybersecurity executives from Jones Day, RELX Group, Intercontinental Exchange and Bank of America
- Machine Learning: The Essentials of Cybersecurity for AI and Machine Learning explored the new considerations for CISOs, network administrators, and frontline responders associated with ML, and recent advances, including research underway at Georgia Tech.
- Moderated by Patrick Gaul from National Technology Security Coalition and Wenke Lee of Georgia Tech, and executives from Turner Broadcasting and JASK
- Smart Cities: The Security of Smart Cities under Nation-State Threats focused on the critical risk factors that need to be assessed as smart cities and vendors prepare for the evolving risks.
- Moderated by Georgia Tech’s Margaret Loper, with executives from Honeywell, IPaT at Georgia Tech, Bastille Networks. and Prototype Prime
Research Scientist, Assistant Professor Represent IC in DARPA Risers Event
Stefan Lee, a research scientist in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing with an affiliation in the Machine Learning Center, was selected a top-3 finisher at the DARPA Risers event this year. The selection gave him the opportunity to present during the DARPA 60th Anniversary (D60).
The DARPA Risers program selects from early-career researchers that are identified by the agency as up-and-coming standouts in their fields, capable of discovering and leveraging innovative opportunities for technological surprise. The initial selection process was performed by DARPA program managers in response to a call for short white papers.
In total, DARPA Risers consisted of 50 individuals from diverse fields to compete for three spots that would present at D60. Among those 50 were Lee and School of Interactive Computing Assistant Professor Matthew Gombolay. The selection process began with a judged poster session, reducing the pool to 10 finalists, and a five-minute talk, which selected the final three.
Lee presented his team’s work on EmbodiedQA, generally talking about the potential of training embodied agents in simulated environments.
“The legacy of DARPA is one of transformative scientific and societal contribution,” Lee said. “From the foundations of the modern internet to the network of satellites enabling global positioning systems, our daily lives are shaped by the lasting impact of DARPA’s willingness to pursue uncertain but revolutionary technological possibilities. It was a great honor to be a part of the celebration of the organizations 60th anniversary and have the opportunity to represent the 2018 Riser cohort during the plenary session.”

School of Computer Science Students Dominate at Demo Day
School of Computer Science (SCS) students won three of the four top prizes at the Institute for Information Security and Privacy's (IISP) Cybersecurity Demo Day. The research showcase was part of the IISP 16th annual Cybersecurity Summit on Oct. 4.
Sixteen Georgia Tech student groups entered the IISP Cybersecurity Demo Day poster and two-minute madness competition for the chance to win a total of $10,000 in prizes. These teams are automatically eligible to participate in the Demo Day program that offers $125,000 in total cash prizes and industry mentorship to help commercialize their work. The final winner will be chosen in the spring, but the summit was the participants’ first opportunity to receive feedback on their projects.
One of the goals of Demo Day is to help students get comfortable with presenting their work. To achieve this, each group presented their research as part of a two-minute madness round during the summit and then participated in a poster session where cybersecurity industry leaders and academics could ask questions.
“If you’re doing a Ph.D., you need to be able to do public speaking to get research funding,” said SCS Ph.D. student Carter Yagemann.
Attendees voted for the most promising project, which won the first prize. A panel of local chief information security officers selected the other two winners. New this year was a prize for a spot in CREATE-X.
- 1st prize $5,000 (chosen by popular vote): Home-based IoT Evaluation by Omar Alrawi (School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)) and Chaz Lever (SCS)
- 2nd prize $3,000 (chosen by panel of experts): LADIDS by Tohid Shekari (ECE), Christian Bayens (ECE), Morris Cohen (ECE associate professor), Lukas Graber (ECE assistant professor), and Raheem Beyah (ECE associate chair)
- 3rd prize $2,000 (chosen by panel of experts): Telephony Blacklist by Sharbani Pandit (SCS)
- CREATE-X Prize: Justitia by Carter Yagemann, Erkam Uzun (SCS), and Simon Pak Ho Chung (SCS research scientist), Wenke Lee (SCS professor)
Although they did not place in the top three, the other teams are still eligible to compete in the 2019 finale, and can attend a three-month training course on how to commercialize a product. Students who could not attend the summit can still join the program if they email Gloria Griessman.
Here are some SCS research highlights to look out for in the spring:
Project: Enabling Cross-Host Refinable Attack Investigation
Team: SCS Ph.D. students Yang Ji, Mattia Fazzini, Joey Allen, Evan Downing, and postdoctoral fellow Sangho Lee
Research Topic: Last year, the team introduced a tool that can replay a cyberattack. Now the team is expanding the tool to multiple hosts to get a complete picture of an attack.
Project: An Anonymous Survey System Supporting Real-time Authorization
Team: SCS Ph.D. student Jiahui Lu and Computational Science and Engineering student Haowen Zhang
Research Topic: Surveys are vital for businesses, but how can a restaurant be sure that a customer leaving a Yelp review has actually dined at the restaurant? This research creates an anonymous survey system with real-time authentication.
Project: Towards Measuring the Effectiveness of Telephony Blacklists
Team: SCS Ph.D. student Sharbani Pandit
Research Topic: Expanding off her research on generating a telephone hacking blacklist, now she is focusing on how to overcome caller ID spoofing, where copycat phone numbers look exactly like a victim’s own. Eventually, she hopes to build an Android app.
Project: Justitia: Privacy-Preserving and Recoverable Remote Biometric Authentication
Team: SCS Ph.D. students Erkam Uzun and Carter Yagemann, research scientist Simon Pak Ho Chung, and Professor Wenke Lee
Research Topic: Biometric data is more secure than any password, but replacing biometrics every time a user gets a new device is tedious. We need to be able to authenticate biometric data remotely while preserving users' privacy. The team created a remote authentication server that performs biometric matching over encrypted biometric data.
Professor Named as Technologist Advisor to U.S. National Security Court
Annie Antón, a professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing, has been named a technologist advisor to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).
Starting this month, Antón will assist the court in a part-time role. She is the only academic among the three technologists.
The FISC may receive assistance from an “amicus curiae” (friend of the court), who has expertise in privacy and civil liberties, intelligence collection, communications technology, or other relevant areas.
“I am honored to be asked to assist with foreign intelligence cases that involve national security, cybersecurity, and privacy,” Antón said. “Technologists play a vital role in helping the courts understand how complex systems operate in practice, in order to assure that systems comply with the law.”
Antón, a Georgia Tech graduate, returned to serve as chair of the School of Interactive Computing from 2012 to 2017.
In 2016, she was one of 12 members of the President’s Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity.
IC Professors John Stasko and Gregory Abowd Earn Test of Time Awards
Two College of Computing professors were recognized with test of time awards at two conferences this month, demonstrating the lasting impact of their research in respective fields.
School of Interactive Computing Professor Gregory Abowd’s work with former Ph.D. student Shwetak Patel and postdoctoral student and research scientist Matt Reynolds was recognized at UbiComp 2018 in Singapore earlier this month. The paper was presented at the Pervasive 2008 Conference and was titled Detecting Human Movement by Differential Air Pressure Sensing in HVAC System Ductwork: An Exploration in Infrastructure Mediated Sensing.
The paper presented an approach to detect movement and room transition throughout an entire house through sensing at only one point in the home. At the time, it was a new class of human activity monitoring they called “infrastructure-mediated sensing, and it detected things like disruptions in airflow caused by human movement.
This approach presents a cost-effective advantage to installing motion sensors throughout an entire home.
This is the second straight such 10-year recognition Abowd, Patel, and Reynolds have received at UbiComp. Their paper At the Flick of a Switch: Detecting and Classifying Unique Electrical Events on the Residential Power Line, written with Julie Kientz and Tom Robertson, was recognized at UbiComp 2017.
School of Interactive Computing Professor John Stasko received a similar designation this year at IEEE VIS 2018 for research he performed while on sabbatical at Microsoft Research in Fall 2007. Stasko, along with other members on his team, proposed two alternative trend visualizations that use static depictions of trends: one which shows traces of all trends overlaid simultaneously in one display and a second that uses a small multiples display to show the trend traces side-by-side.
The paper, titled Effectiveness of Animation in Trend Visualization, evaluates the visualizations and indicates that trend animation is challenging to use and, despite being engaging for participants, it leads to errors and is least effective for analysis.
The paper was presented at InfoVis in 2008. Like Abowd, this is Stasko’s second straight year receiving a 10-year legacy award at IEEE VIS. His work with co-authors Carsten Görg, Zhicheng Liu, and Kanupriya Singhal, titled Jigsaw: Supporting Investigative Analysis through Interactive Visualization, was recognized last year.
School of Computer Science’s Edge Computing Summit Fosters Collaboration
Dozens of faculty members gathered on Oct. 22 to discuss one of the most promising research endeavors, edge computing. School of Computer Science (SCS) Professor Umakishore Ramachandran organized the all-day summit to bring faculty together from various schools and encourage collaboration.
“There are so many cool things happening across different research groups at Georgia Tech in edge computing,” Ramachandran said. “If we put them together, we can accomplish something really big. Georgia Tech has the opportunity to be the leader, but in order to do that we need to think as a collective.”
Edge computing uses devices at the edge of a network, from smartphones to Internet of Things (IoT) devices, to perform computation. By processing the data close to its source, edge computing can improve latency, security, and cost.
For the summit, 10 researchers from SCS and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) gave 10-minute talks on their general research. They were divided into three sessions. After each round, there was a panel with the speakers moderated by a session chair, who asked each presenter to discuss possible joint research projects.
Although there were different interpretations of what constitutes an edge, the breadth of research projects speaks to the wide-ranging possibilities of edge computing. SCS Professor Ellen Zegura discussed her work with Professor Mostafa Ammar on creating a self-configuring cloud of clustered mobile devices called a femtocloud. ECE Professor Gee-Kung Chang suggested using 5G radio access networks to achieve sub-millisecond latency for getting data to edge node.
Presentations included system software technologies for edge computing, including programming frameworks, compiler technologies, algorithmic techniques, and management of big data in support of edge computing. SCS Professor Vivek Sarkar suggested software foundations for the edge platform. SCS Associate Professor Santosh Pande is devising compiler annotations to data and trust verification to enable data sharing and migration among mobile devices on the edge. SCS Associate Professor Ada Gavrilovska proposed ideas for distributing model generation between the cloud, edge, and devices for intelligent analytics. ECE Assistant Professor Tushar Krishna discussed opportunities for continuous learning via neuro-evolutionary algorithms involving hardware-software co-design at the edge.
Security and privacy issues are paramount with edge computing. SCS Research Faculty Ketan Bharadwaj identified the challenges in securing the edge infrastructure from malicious attacks. ECE Professor Abhijit Chatterjee offered algorithmic ideas for mitigating security attacks and increasing error resilience using robotics as a “killer app” for the edge. SCS Associate Professor Vladimir Kolesnikov discussed efficient cryptographic techniques for ensuring secure communication and ideas for their deployment that would ensure low latency.
Ramachandran concluded the summit presentations by offering challenges and opportunities for elevating the edge to become a peer of the cloud.
The summit’s afternoon focused on opportunities for collaboration. his approach was one of the reasons Ramachandran organized the summit. By bringing together researchers with varied complementary interests, Ramachandran hopes to bridge the gap and help push the field further. School of Interactive Computing Professor Beth Mynatt discussed leveraging existing research to make Tech a frontrunner in edge innovation.
“The industry leaders are not thinking yet about how cool and new the edge is,” he said. “All the cool things are being done by small start-ups and academia. Here, we can think of things we can do that industry is not yet doing. That’s the opportunity we have.”

School of Computer Science Professor Works with Microsoft Research to Make Data Transformation Easier
The growing field of self-service data transformation took a big step forward with the Transform-Data-by-Example (TDE) service. TDE works as a search engine for data transformation libraries, alleviating the difficulty of data wrangling.
The project was at an early stage of conception at Microsoft Research when School of Computer Science Assistant Professor Xu Chu joined and helped contribute to its success.
“Data transformation is a big part of data cleaning, which is very time consuming and expensive,” Chu said.
When data comes from different sources or is manually entered, it’s often inconsistent and challenging to work with until it’s prepared. Data preparation involves cleaning, standardizing, and transforming raw data sets so they can be analyzed effectively. Data scientists can spend up to 80 percent of their time just transforming data.
Developers have created custom code libraries for tasks, such as name parsing and address standardization, that data scientists might need for transformation. Yet these libraries are only useful if the data scientist can find them. Finding them hasn’t always been easy – until now.
TDE indexes thousands of functions from GitHub and Stackoverflow, so users only need to provide their desired output for a few input examples to find the transformation program they need. Currently, TDE has a 72 percent accuracy rate for synthesizing correct transformation programs.
The front-end of TDE is a Microsoft Excel plug-in that users can download from Office. Once the user provides a few input/output examples, TDE connects with the back-end on Microsoft Azure’s cloud to search thousands of functions and synthesize programs using relevant functions that will work for the user. This leverages techniques from the program synthesis field.
“This is a great example of how technologies from non-database domains can help with hard data management problems such as data cleaning,” Chu said.
He believes this type of research has a lot of potential. For example, Chu is working on a project of using matrix and tensor factorization techniques in statistics and machine learning to do data cleaning.
The work on TDE was presented at the Very Large Databases conference in Rio di Janeiro in late August. Chu coauthored the paper Transform Data by Example (TDE): An Extensible Search Engine for Data Transformations with Microsoft Research’s Surajit Chaudhuri, Kris Ganjam, Yeye He, and Vivek Narasayya, and Twitter’s Yudian Zheng. Earlier, a demo of the work was presented at SIGMOD 2018 in Houston.
Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies Explores Solutions from the Entire Stack
The density of transistors in microchips can no longer be expected to double every year, but there are only a few researchers dedicated to solving the end of Moore’s law from all angles. They gathered at Georgia Tech for the second annual Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH) Summit on Nov. 2.
More than 80 faculty members, industry partners, and students attended the all-day summit, which featured 10 plenary talks on the future of computingand concluded with a panel discussion of these suggestions.
The day reflected how much CRNCH has set the agenda for new computing hierarchies for the entire stack since it was founded in 2016 by Tom Conte, a professor in the schools of Computer Science (SCS) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).
“Three years ago, when Moore’s law was on its death bed, most architects went into mourning, but Tom was different,” College of Computing Dean Zvi Galil said during his opening remarks. “Immediately after the funeral, he created CRNCH to actually do something.”
CRNCH has grown ever since. Now the center has more than 30 dedicated faculty members from the College of Computing, the College of Engineering, the College of Sciences, and the Georgia Tech Research Institute. This year, SCS Professor Vivek Sarkar was named co-director to offer his high performance computing and programming languages expertise. CRNCH’s first research lab — the Rogues Gallery , a collection of novel hardware – continues to add new hardware and has pioneered industry connections with partners such as Emu Technologies.
“Everyone is coming up with new architectures, but what happens when these architectures meet real programmers and real students?” Jason Riedy, a research scientist in the School of Computational Science and Engineering, said of the Rogues Gallery. “We’re trying to break the idea of ‘it’s too much work’ to try something new.”
CRNCH is all about trying something new, “the crazier the better,” as Conte said. The plenary talks covered a lot of innovations that could propel computing forward from architecture and artificial intelligence to quantum computing and algorithms.
Some research highlights:
- Dana Randall, professor in SCS and co-executive director of the Institute for Data Science and Engineering, suggested using emergent computation, which she defines as predictable macro changes to system as the user modifies a few parameters.
- Moinuddin Qureshi, professor in ECE, highlighted the potential of quantum computing.
“Quantum computing is exotic and seems like something only physics and mathematics can touch, but it’s very important for the field that engineers are aware of this,” Qureshi said. “The real metric for success is reliability. If we can come up with good architectures and compilers that can reduce the error rate, that can be a big win.”
Another goal of the summit was to invite collaboration, and many presenters detailed how novel architectures could benefit their research, including:
- David Womble, director of Artificial Intelligence Programs at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, discussed the lab’s efforts in AI for endeavors such as bioscience, material synthesis, and additive manufacturing that require thinking about computing in a new way to achieve success.
- Jim Ang, manager of Physical & Computational Sciences at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, presented the history and the future of high performance computing in the Department of Energy’s national labs.
- Jason Poovey, a research scientist at George Tech Research Institute, emphasized how the Center for Health Analytics and Informatics (CHAI) needs new scalable architectures for the health data they work with.
A keynote from Peter Kogge, a distinguished professor at Notre Dame and IEEE Computer Society Pioneer award winner, perhaps summed up best the challenges and opportunities of this post-Moore era that CRNCH is eager to take on.
“Post-Moore is going to be heavily heterogeneous, lots of new technologies will show up first as accelerators, clock rates will continue to go flat meaning we will have billions of threads, and power efficiency is paramount,” he said. “We need some new thinking to get around this.”
First Rogue Takes Flight: How CRNCH Builds Strong Industry Partnerships
Some of the most unique computers in the world are housed in the Rogues Galley, a collection of uncommon architectures hosted by Georgia Tech’s Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH). Last September, the gallery received its first member, the Emu Chick, and this year CRNCH researchers have made considerable progress programming the Chick to the benefit of CRNCH and their industry partner, Emu Technology.
The Emu Chick is an eight-node system housed in a tower case that is designed to move computation to data, providing sufficient memory and storage bandwidth for common data analysis applications. Having new architectures like the Emu Chick in the Rogues Gallery allows academics, students, and industry professionals the opportunity to collaborate on hardware.
Working with this early release hardware has led to a strong partnership with Emu Technologies as students and researchers have learned how to use the machine effectively. Researchers submitted more than 15 bug requests related to Emu simulation framework, toolchain, and hardware execution. These requests allowed Emu to fix multiple bugs, improving the Emu toolchain and system’s performance and stability. “Students’ creativity and persistence in running their codes with each agile iteration of both hardware and toolchain enabled Emu to test a far wider range of issues than we could have been able to develop and test on our own, resulting in Emu developing better bug diagnosis tools and delivering complete fixes,” said Emu Chief Operating Officer Martin Deneroff.
Yet this relationship was mutually beneficial to Tech, too. Emu and Tech collaborated on using the prototype to enhance Institute development priorities for irregular applications, tensor decomposition, and other applications. For many students, this was also the first time they were able to work directly with industry. “The Rogues Gallery gives researchers the opportunity to test their ideas on unique platforms and get actual results at larger scale,” said computer architecture Ph.D. student Cameron Braun. Students get the rare opportunity to work with industry leaders also interested in the hardware, such as the researcher from Sandia National Laboratories who became Braun’s mentor and later offered him a summer internship.
For alumnus Eric Hein, Emu started off as a way to experiment with the coolest computers and eventually led to his first job after he finished his Ph.D. in spring 2018. Everything with the Chick was new and different, including how Hein started thinking about his approach to architecture. “Several weird aspects of the architecture like automatic thread migrations and hardware indexing modes forced me to rethink the way I wrote code from the ground up, reading between the lines to reason about how each decision would influence the behavior of the system,” he said.
Hein got so good at thinking about the Emu programming model that he became a technical resource for Chick users at Tech and beyond, eventually creating a custom STREAM implementation that can handle memory errors and scale to a large number of threads. This work led to a full-time position at Emu, where he understands the architecture as well as its developers but can relate to it from a user perspective. Such a partnership wouldn’t have been possible without his work with the Rogues Gallery. “If it weren't for CRNCH, I might never have heard of Emu,” he said.
Industry leaders are also recognizing the value of merging academic researchers with emerging technologies. In fall 2017, CRNCH met with Sandia researchers to discuss a Kokkos Cilk backend for running Kokkos on the Emu system. This discussion influenced a new partnership between Sandia and School of Computational Science and Engineering Professor Umit Catalyurek and School of Computer Science Research Scientist Jeff Young in 2018. These partnerships can also exist outside of the Rogues Gallery, such as with recent National Science Foundation funding for a project led by CRNCH Co-Director Vivek Sarkar and Emu founder Peter Kogge that is focused on migrating thread architectures and asynchronous task models for graph analytics applications.
Emu and CRNCH’s partnership has given every participant a competitive advantage. ”The ability to tap into technically strong researchers who are grounded in hands-on experience with our product, coupled with the strong industry partnerships Tech engages in, gives Emu an immediate leg up as we do on-going market research related to product requirements to address market problems that are only just beginning to emerge,” said Anne Vincenti, Emu’s vice president of marketing.
Emu is just the first successful partnership for CRNCH. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with stacked memory, neuromorphic devices, and other unique hardware are being added to the Rogues Gallery, and CRNCH is always looking for more collaborators. For more information on the Rogues Gallery and on related Emu work, please see the Rogues Gallery page and Emu’s site.
Computing Celebrates Luminaries’ Lasting Contributions
The Georgia Tech College of Computing inducted its first four members into its Hall of Fame during a ceremony held Nov. 9 at the Historic Academy of Medicine in Atlanta.
A select group of guests attended the ceremony honoring Dorothy Murray Crosland, Peter A. Freeman, John P. Imlay, Jr., and Christopher W. Klaus for their lasting contributions to the success of the College of Computing.
“Simply put, the College of Computing would not be what it is today without the contributions of these four individuals,” said Zvi Galil, The John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing. “I cannot think of four people that have done more to shape the spirit and direction of the College than our inaugural class of inductees.”
According to Development Director Brad Hastings, the Hall of Fame has been established to recognize College alumni and friends’ contributions to computing and computer science education.
“From academia to government to industry, the impact of the GT Computing Community is being felt far and wide. We felt the time was right to start recognizing the contributions of those that best reflect the College’s aspirational spirit,” Hastings said.

The next College of Computing Hall of Fame event is set for April 26, 2019. While the Nov. 9 event was a low-key affair by design, the spring event will be more of a gala. Along with a larger guest list, the event will celebrate the full inaugural class, which includes Class Zero.
“Although we selected Class Zero based on their unquestionable contributions to the College, going forward we’ll be looking to the GT Computing Community for Hall of Fame nominations,” said Hastings. “We’ll be sharing information about the nomination process early next year.”
The inductees are known as Class Zero:
Dorothy M. Crosland
The ceremony began with the induction of Crosland into the newly established College of Computing Hall of Fame. A longtime Director of the Georgia Tech Library, Crosland was instrumental in the founding of a graduate program in information science in 1963, which evolved into the College of Computing. She also played a key role in securing the admission of women to Georgia Tech.
Peter A. Freeman
Freeman was honored for his service as the founding dean of the College. In 1990, Freeman began with about 30 faculty members, less than $2 million in research funding, and just a few hundred students. By the time he stepped down in 2002, Freeman had more than doubled the number of tenured faculty, grown annual research funding to more than $10 million, and substantially increased enrollment.
John P. Imlay Jr.
Legendary Atlanta philanthropist and Georgia Tech alumnus Imlay was recognized for his early support of the College. During the 1992-93 academic year, Imlay donated funds establishing the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing chair. This was the first dean’s chair at Georgia Tech. His initial investment evolved into two additional endowed faculty chairs in the College.
Christopher W. Klaus
The ceremony concluded with the Hall of Fame induction of longtime College advisory board member Klaus. Klaus was honored for his generous financial support, which resulted in the building that bears his name, the Klaus Advanced Computing Building at Georgia Tech, along with his support of Create-X – a program that guides student start-ups at Georgia Tech.
Georgia Tech Researchers Discover How to Measure Video Quality
Binge-watching TV is only fun if the video is clear, but a few pixelated minutes are enough to ruin a night. A team from Georgia Tech’s School of Computer Science (SCS) has been working with an internet service provider (ISP) to make the viewing experience better.
With video streaming making up more than 80 percent of all network traffic, customers, carriers, and content providers all care about video quality. ISPs and content providers measure this through a metric called quality of experience (QoE), which takes image quality, buffering, and startup delay into account.
“The quality of experience in video streaming directly translates to customer satisfaction and revenues for a company,” said Tarun Mangla, an SCS Ph.D. student on the team. “Figuring out QoE is the first problem you should tackle before improving it.”
Although most major streaming services – like Netflix, Hulu, and others – track QoE, they don’t share this data with ISPs. Moreover, these services have started using end-to-end encryption, severely limiting ISPs' view of network traffic. This is where SCS researchers can help. Instead of ISPs waiting for customers to complain about stalling videos, Tech researchers have found a way to use encrypted network traffic to estimate QoE for ISPs, enabling them to react sooner.
To determine the QoE for encrypted video, the researchers created eMIMIC, a methodology that looks at network traffic patterns in relation to how the video streams. video services use adaptive bitrates, in which media streaming quality is adjusted in real time to match a user’s bandwidth and device capability. This is achieved by dividing the video into chunks, encoding each chunk into quality levels, and dynamically adapting chunk quality in response to changing user conditions.
The researchers developed a model that uses the network traffic to simulate how a typical streaming service session runs and estimate its QoE. The researchers show that their method works for a variety of streaming services and outperforms state-of-the-art QoE inference approaches, giving ISPs a more accurate view of customer experience.
Measuring QoE is only the start of the research. Next the researchers want to determine whether a QoE error is the operator’s responsibility or a client or service error. If it is the operator’s problem, the researchers will work on improving the operator’s network by putting in policies that can adapt to whatever the issue is. Once ISPs have a better understanding of what the problem is and where it’s coming from, they can work to ensure a user’s viewing experience is consistent and clear. In other words, buffering will be a problem of the past.
Mangla presented the work in the paper eMIMIC: Estimating HTTP-based Video QoE Metrics from Encrypted Network Traffic, coauthored with Emir Halepovic, who is a principal inventive scientist at AT&T, and SCS Professors Mostafa Ammar and Ellen Zegura. The team won the best paper award at IEEE/IFIP Conference on Traffic Measurement and Analysis in Vienna, Austria, in June.
Designing a Better Future: Ari Schlesinger Keeps Tech Focus on Equity, Inclusion
Ari Schlesinger was spending time at Microsoft Research (MSR) in Cambridge, United Kingdom, shortly after a Microsoft AI chatbot made headlines for devolving into a racist, sexist mess within 24 hours of launch in 2016.
After the incident, an influx of think pieces about the chatbot, named “Tay,” attempted to explain that racism was a design issue. If designed better, they contended, chatbots wouldn’t encounter these problems.
Schlesinger and her MSR collaborators wrote a piece in response, contending that it’s not just a design flaw, but a problem with how tech firms and, more broadly, designers think about these issues in general.
“We wanted to point out research opportunities to figure out ways that we can do better at considering issues like race and identity when designing systems to avoid creating something like a chatbot that reproduces the types of problems that Tay produced,” she said. “It’s important that we really identify the central issue that causes these problems. It’s hard to address a problem if you can’t name it.”
These questions are central to the research she is conducting at Georgia Tech, where she is now a Ph.D. student advised by Professors Beki Grinter and Keith Edwards in the School of Interactive Computing. Recently, she was a finalist for the Foley Scholarship, where she was recognized for her research into ways enterprises can institute strategies to support software development with fairness in mind.
Understand the social impact
It wasn’t a straightforward path to studying equity, inclusion, and fairness in computer science (CS), however.
In 2012, Schlesinger’s second year pursuing a CS major through Harvey Mudd at Pitzer College -- both members of The Claremont Colleges network -- she had a realization. CS degrees, she noticed, were not focusing on the vast social impacts that they were producing. She began to worry that an awareness of this social change might be missing in many CS educational environments.
“About a year and a half into my degree, I was just like – these machines, these programs, they’re ubiquitous,” she said. “They’re in everything. They’re changing the world, and we’re not talking about that.”
It was this realization that led her to course correct during her undergraduate degree. She redefined her major at Pitzer College and adjusted the trajectory of her career to pursue research full-time. Schlesinger honed in on an area she says is vital to introducing mechanisms in enterprise, education, and beyond that protect against bias and exclusion.
One of the benefits of being at Pitzer College for her undergraduate degree was that Schlesinger was given the opportunity to define her own major. Her interests at the intersection of computer science, humanities, and social sciences led to a degree she designed, called “technology and social change.”
The social impacts at the heart of technology and CS are central to her interests, and she found that CS education was one of the few spaces she had experienced in computing that was really thinking about social impact. Upon graduation, she took a position at Harvey Mudd College running a National Science Foundation grant in CS education called “CS Teaching Tips.”
While there was a semblance of an ethics requirement in most CS degrees, whether or not it was a priority was unclear to Schlesinger through her experiences, and that was her concern.
“Who is teaching it? How is it defined? What’s being covered? Often what you learn about ethics and these social concerns in CS depends on who you know and what you’re exposed to,” she explained. “Sometimes in academia, I think we have these siloing problems, where one discipline does this and another does that and it’s very hard to move between the two.”
It’s important, she said, that CS departments have someone within them who bring all of these disparate fields together, introducing people to literature and ideas they may not otherwise see in their respective disciplines.
It was this focus that drew her to Georgia Tech, specifically as it pertained to advisors Grinter and Edwards. She was looking for graduate advisors who could get excited about this idea investigating and implementing equity and inclusion within things like programming languages or artificial intelligence. Thinking more broadly, she knew that this wasn’t just a problem within CS education, but within technology as a whole.
“The pot is full -- those questions of who gets an advantage or not when we are designing software or when we build computing systems," she said. "Technical systems have the opportunity to minimize expansion of harm, but they also have the opportunity to further discriminate. What can we do to stop hurting each other?”
‘The next step depends on you’
Her future work at Georgia Tech will follow a similar path, examining issues of equity and bias in online communities.
“Online communities seem to be places where many people of color, women, people with various marginalized identities are harassed,” Schlesinger said. “That happens in the tech workplace, and it happens in these open-source spaces. Part of our work will look at this distilled problem space and ask questions about what is the connection between inclusion, discrimination and online communities. Are there ways these spaces are designed that inhibit good behaviors or promote bad?”
Of course, her next step in this research is only one approach, and she said that it’s important to note there are many paths to pursue. Asked what the next step in this space should be, Schlesinger turned it around.
“The answer is that there is a clear step for everybody and the world would be a better place if we took that next step, but the next step depends on you,” she said. “Who you are, what you’re doing, where you work, what you think about. There is something to do, but what that is depends on you.”
David Devecsery Wants to Build Better Systems
In the world of academia, sometimes the most innovative research isn’t practical. Yet new Assistant Professor David Devecsery believes he has a duty to build usable systems.
“I want to create better systems and ways of doing things with hopes someone else will use it,” he said.
Developing systems
Devecsery has been working on finding solutions to real-world problems since college. In his junior year as a computer science student at the University of Michigan, where he also completed his M.S. and Ph.D., Devecsery joined an embedded systems project to help spread information in the developing world.
The Talking Book was an audio computer created to transmit information in some of the world’s poorest countries, where electricity is unreliable and cellphones are too expensive.
Yet the device’s original format cost $45 to build and wasn’t energy efficient, so Devecsery and his team developed an inexpensive custom microprocessor. He helped design the project from the original chip to the computer’s applications. The three-year endeavor solidified his interest in systems.
Designing and building an entire computing stack from the ground up came with challenges. Debugging the chip was no easy feat, especially when the debugging interface itself had a bug.
“It’s very nice to look at buggy software and make it reliable and understand how it doesn’t work,” he said.
Solving system failure
As software systems grow more complex, they become more challenging to debug. Having tools to analyze and understand the space is important if software is going to be scaled effectively. With this in mind, Devecsery’s systems research has focused on two avenues: eidetic systems and optimistic hybrid analysis.
Eidetic computer systems have the ability to recall any past setup or state of the computer. Therefore, they can be useful in recreating events to help figure out what happened during a system failure or a cyberattack. The process is typically time-consuming and manual, but Devecsery’s research automates it. With this information, researchers can learn how to improve software or debug more efficiently.
“Most of these scenarios are preventable with techniques we know today, but most are too expensive to do practically,” Devecsery said. “The research is how we can take techniques and make them more efficient so we can use them today.”
Georgia Tech researchers are already using Devecsery’s work. One of the most promising cybersecurity breakthroughs of the last year was the Refinable Attack INvestigation (RAIN), which is a new software system that enables researchers to accurately and quickly determine how and when intruders entered a network, what data they took, and what systems were compromised.
Optimistic hybrid analysis helps to prevent many software bugs, such as data-races. A data-race occurs when a system attempts to perform two or more operations on the same data simultaneously. Although computer scientists already have the tools to do data-race detection, they slow the system down by 10 times and are often inaccurate.
Devecsery’s work uses a strategic mix of static (examining code without running the program) and dynamic (examining code while running the program), or hybrid, analysis. By making dynamic observations of the code, researchers can trim down how much static analysis they must do, making it much more efficient.
Training better systems researchers
Devecsery is also passionate about training future researchers to do this work. He has been teaching since he joined his high school’s tutoring club and considers it one of the main reasons he was drawn to academia. He prefers an active learning approach where he gives students difficult questions to discuss with a partner and then apply to a real-world situation.
After joining the School of Computer Science in the fall semester, he found the next generation of researchers. The students are “extremely intelligent and think creatively about research,” according to Devecsery.
“I really believe when you give students a challenge and they come to you for help, you never really tell them the answer,” he said. “You just turn on a light down that path and encourage them to take a step in the right direction.”
Georgia Tech Researchers Helping Develop Game to Improve STEM Learning in Chronically-Ill Children
Georgia Tech researchers are partnering with a Georgia-based game developer on a $1.5 million National Institutes of Health (NIH) Small Business Innovation Research grant to help chronically ill children maintain their educational development.
With an emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects, researchers from the Schools of Interactive Computing (IC) and the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) are teaming with Thrust Interactive, Inc., to create digital games that can help these kids that tend to miss a lot of school due to their illnesses.
Associate Professor Betsy DiSalvo (IC) and Associate Professor Wilbur Lam (BME) are leading the project, which will span two years under the current terms of the grant. Their goal is to take advantage of the time chronically ill children spend in waiting rooms, having transfusions, or other times spent outside of the classroom.
The digital games are based on physical tabletop games created by members of Lam’s lab. Led by Dr. Elaissa Hardy (Emory), a team of BME undergraduate students originally created the tabletop games to help kids in the hospital with sickle cell disease engage with STEM subjects.
Lam’s lab has worked with DiSalvo and Thrust for the past two years to pilot test digital versions of these games. The new NIH grant will be used to develop findings from the pilot testing so the research team can better understand how to create a scalable model that can be used in hospitals across the country.
Another challenge the team wants to address is the difficulty children face in discussing their diseases with others. Common illnesses such as diabetes and asthma, as well as those less common like sickle cell and cystic fibrosis, can be challenging topics for children, particularly in their early teen years.
“The middle schoolers we interviewed told us it was awkward to talk about their disease,” DiSalvo said. “Sometimes, they got bullied or had issues finding ways to discuss it with their peers. Previous research has shown that if you can have kids play a game around their disease, they’ll engage about it more in conversation with peers and families.
“It can diminish the stigma, and it also positions them as experts. When children feel like they have an expertise, they are usually willing to dive deeper and learn more to maintain their expert position.”
A better understanding of their disease at this age is critical for young people beginning to take charge of managing their own care, according to the researchers.
“These adolescents are beginning to transition into adulthood, so managing their illness is beginning to become their responsibility,” DiSalvo said. “Those transitions are difficult because, in doctor visits, parents tend to dominate the conversation while kids sit in the background, not really asking questions or engaging. It’s important to change that dynamic at this age.”
The researchers are investigating three different approaches to the digital games to determine the best learning experience outcomes. They will test content using:
- Pictures and words
- Pictures and audio
- Pictures, words, and audio.
Follow-up comprehension tests after will help determine which approach leads to the best results. Those tests will take up the first year of the project, with the second year focused on testing the application in live hospital settings.
“We want it to be so fun and engaging that they don’t think of it as an educational game,” said Sarah Boyd, a Thrust Interactive team member who will work on design.
“It’s fun, and they’re learning. There are existing approaches relating to the education of disease, but they aren’t as engaging. We want a fun and engaging game first, but then they’re going to be learning about their health as they engage.”
Thrust Interactive has elicited help from Paul Jenkins, a comic book writer and video game creator who has been involved with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a number of Marvel Comics titles, and video games like God of War and The Darkness.
New IC Assistant Professor Matthew Gombolay Takes Flight at Georgia Tech
School of Interactive Computing Assistant Professor Matthew Gombolay was always interested in space and aviation. He had taken some flying lessons as a teen and after college decided that he wanted to finish his pilot certification. He had received some prodding from his then-girlfriend – now wife – in the form of a flight lesson in the Washington D.C. area.
Although he had done classes when he was around 15 or 16 years old, he treated it like it was a brand-new experience for him.
“It kind of was,” said Gombolay, who had backed out of his lessons when he was younger after being told he was ready to fly solo about eight hours in. “I got a little shy and embarrassed and quiet, but I always wanted to do it.”
And he did, receiving his certification after finishing his undergraduate degree. It was everything he had hoped. It was a different experience than his studies and his research, which is mostly an exercise of his mental capabilities. Flying required mental effort, but also physical – his hands, his feet, coordination of his body. It was something that he appreciated.
But it was also something that helped guide him on the path he wanted to follow for his research.
Earning his wings
His studies lie in a number of areas, namely robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), human factors engineering, human-robot interaction, planning and scheduling, queuing theory, real-time systems, and operations research.
A lot of that was borne out of a specific experience he had during a flight lesson.
“I was flying the aircraft, and my instructor told me to plot a diversion to another airport because we were going to pretend that the airport I was headed to had some weather that would prevent me from landing,” he explained. “That’s a lot of work. You have to fly the plane, you have to get out a map and do all the segments you’ll take, measure the angles, measure distances, calculate fuel burn and figure out how you’ll change your flight plan.”
So, when given the directive to use autopilot while doing the calculations, Gombolay input his altitude and heading and stuck his head into his calculations.
It was a mistake.
“She told me I broke the first rule,” he said. “You have to aviate, navigate, then communicate. I was so desperate to handle the workload that I turned over the first duty to an autopilot and didn’t really know how it worked.
“If there was Mt. Everest in front of us, it wasn’t going to steer away. If there was another plane, it wasn’t going to steer away. If it was low on fuel, it wasn’t going to tell me to turn back.”
It was a realization of how quickly and easily humans are willing to trust automated systems that may not be entirely prepared to handle that workload. Your willingness to be vulnerable is a huge choice, he said.
“I can trust something, but that doesn’t make it trustworthy,” he said.
This realization helped guide him to human factors engineering during his graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned his Ph.D. in Autonomous Systems in 2017.
Making robots personal
Since joining Georgia Tech in the beginning of the fall semester, Gombolay has been growing his lab and beginning a handful of new projects that build on some of his past research.
One recently-funded project done in collaboration with MIT focuses on how humans make decisions as part of a team – the strategies, the styles, etc. Using a video game as an example, he explained that some individuals may prefer an aggressive approach versus a defensive.
“These different stylistic things emerge naturally in how humans solve problems,” Gombolay said. “But that diversity isn’t very pleasant for machine learning algorithms because the average of two different people is not a third good person. It’s just an ugly mess.”
His lab is looking at ways to synthesize policies that can leverage all of the data about styles and strategies and tailor to individual differences. Health care is an example, Gombolay said. Consider a physical therapist who wants to teach a robot how to take care of a patient at home. Each therapist has his or her own unique style of stretching, massaging, and strength-training their patients, and each patient has a unique malady, response profile, or anatomy.
“Most algorithms today that would be put on a robot to help it learn how to care for a patient would either apply a one-size-fits-all model, which can result in a blend that helps nobody, or train from scratch for each new patient-therapist combination, which would take way too long to be a practical solution.
“We want to leverage every robot’s collective experience while still being able to tailor the behavior to each individual.”
Other areas of focus for his lab include manufacturing, health care, and new areas in reinforcement learning. He is currently funding three students, and his lab includes one research scientist.
A few hobbies
When he’s not doing research – or maybe flying a plane – Gombolay is usually taking part in one of his other hobbies, like tennis or building models of Star Wars or Star Trek ships with his LEGOs and MegaBloks.
He’s also a musician, who started on the violin and piano before adding an alto saxophone to the mix and later a guitar. The guitar is his instrument of choice nowadays, and he’s spent a lot of time using it in bands in college – church, a cover band, talent shows and the like.
He’s found a couple of people on campus, like fellow IC Professor Seth Hutchinson, who don’t mind getting together for a jam session now and again.
As the Star Wars and Star Trek models might suggest, Gombolay has always been fascinated by space and space travel. It’s influenced his path in research and, who knows, in another life he might have been an astronaut.
“Maybe,” he said when asked whether that was ever an ambition. “Who knows? Maybe one day I’ll be on a rocket to Mars. I’ll take my wife and the kid with me. She’s a physician, so she’ll take care of us.”
Eric Vigoda Named American Mathematical Society Fellow
The American Mathematical Society (AMS) named School of Computer Science (SCS) Professor Eric Vigoda a new fellow for 2019.
The 30,000-plus members of AMS nominate individuals who “have made outstanding contributions to the creation, exposition, advancement, communication, and utilization of mathematics.” They selected Vigoda for his contributions to theoretical computer science, emphasizing his work on interactions with probability, combinatorics, and statistical physics.
“I'm honored to receive this recognition of my peers,” Vigoda said.
Vigoda joined Georgia Tech in 2004, where he has become a premier researcher on the connections between statistical physics phase transitions and Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. He is also the director of the Algorithms and Randomness Center in SCS.
“This honor recognizes Eric Vigoda’s high standing in the academic community for his work in algorithms, notably on mixing and other random processes,” SCS Chair Lance Fortnow said.
Vigoda joins SCS faculty Professors Dana Randall and Prasad Tetali as AMS Fellows.
Database Systems Expert Joy Arulraj Joins School of Computer Science
Database systems is one of the most wide-reaching fields in computer science, influencing everything from healthcare to government. For new Assistant Professor Joy Arulraj, database systems allow him to make an impact in as many research areas as possible.
“I’ve always been into solving puzzles, and with databases, you’re free to explore different parts of the data processing pipeline and apply different skill sets,” he said.
With Arulraj’s arrival in fall 2018 as the Barry Dickman Early Career Professor, he strengthened an already robust data science team in the School of Computer Science. Professor Shamkant Navathe designs and models databases. Assistant Professor Xu Chu focuses on data cleaning. Arulraj complements the others with his emphasis on data processing on modern hardware.
Building non-volatile memory database systems
“Hardware keeps changing all the time, so it’s important to revisit the design decisions you make in software systems,” he said.
Arulraj explored this in his doctoral work at Carnegie Mellon University on non-volatile memory database systems. In the past, databases have relied on two types of storage technologies: fast but volatile memory and slow but durable storage. Recently, however, device manufactures created a new class of memory technologies that are both fast and persistent, blurring the gap between memory and storage. These technologies invalidate many design assumptions that computer scientists have had for decades. Arulraj plans to fill the gap by redesigning database systems to work with these new protocols.
“You were constrained by the characteristics of traditional memory and storage technologies for a long, long time, but finally you have something new,” Arulraj said. “Five years ago, working with these new technologies was like a moonshot, but now it’s a burgeoning field in computer science.”
Next-generation multimedia database systems
Since he arrived at Tech, Arulraj is refocusing his research on video analytics. Multimedia databases are challenging because data is unstructured. With the right tools, though, a user could automatically analyze their photostream to determine the last time they saw a friend or went hiking.
Recent advances in machine learning and graphics processing units have increased the accuracy and speed of video analytics. These developments enable researchers to build systems that can query media, like the one Arulraj is currently working on.
Arulraj’s first course at Tech reflects this research. The seminar combines data analytics and deep learning, though he will regularly teach database system implementation in the spring. The core course teaches how to build data processing systems, covering the whole pipeline of processing data.
“This course will be a much more modern take on database systems research,” he said.
Modern databases cross disciplines, and this was one of the reasons Arulraj chose Georgia Tech.
“There are more opportunities here to collaborate across the board, and that’s the future of database systems.”
That's a Wrap! Video Highlights 2018 GT Computing Community Achievements
It’s been another successful year for the GT Computing community! To celebrate the success of our community, we’ve pulled together some College of Computing news highlights from the past 12 months.
Of course, from innovation and entrepreneurship to accolades and achievements, it’s impossible to capture everything in a two-minute video (Yes, just two minutes!). So the stories featured in the GT Computing: 2018 Year in Review are meant to represent all of the accomplishments our students and faculty have achieved this year.
[RELATED: 2017 HOLIDAY GIFT GUIDE]
Here’s to a happy and healthy holiday season and another successful year in 2019!
School of CS Hosts First Capture the Flag Hacking Competition
K-Pop music videos blasted from a room in the Klaus Advanced Computing Building one Friday in November. Inside, students were hunched over their laptops working on cyberattacks against each other. Every so often, they took a break for sodas or snacks and then returned to the battle. It was all part of the School of Computer Science’s (SCS) first Capture the Flag competition (CTF).
CTF is a hacking competition where teams try to maintain control of a server by using real-world cyberattacks. With each successful attack, a team captures a flag, and the team with the most by the end of the contest wins. DEF CON hosts the largest CTF three-day competition, which a team from SCS won last year. SCS Assistant Professor Taesoo Kim decided to bring it home to Tech with a 24-hour competition starting on Nov. 16.
“We wanted to educate the George Tech community by organizing a high-quality CTF,” Kim said. “We want to make this an annual tradition among information security master’s students and undergraduates.”
[RELATED: EVENT PHOTO GALLERY]
Eighteen teams registered, including 51 students and 10 staff members. The winning team, 2young2simple, took home $1,000 and was made up of information security master’s students Po-Ning Tseng (also part of the winning DEF CON team), Mo Chen, Wei-Han Huang, and Mingsuan Yao.
This CTF was less about winning, though, and more about having an opportunity to practice adversarial attacks. Many participants had taken Kim’s Information Security Lab class, where students learn cyberattack strategies like reverse engineering, exploit writing, and how to find vulnerabilities. Competing in CTF allows them to see attacks in action and apply what they have learned.
“I knew literally nothing about CTF challenges before I took Taesoo’s class, and now I won first place with my team members,” Chen said. “That’s why I always consider Taesoo’s class as the most valuable class I have ever taken in Georgia Tech.”
Yet CTF isn’t just about learning how to deploy attacks; it’s also about learning how to collaborate. When most of the competitors know the same techniques, teamwork becomes the main way to secure a victory.
“We know each other's skill set, so we could distribute challenges to a suitable person,” Tseng said. “There was a challenge that required knowledge in both pwn and crypto. Two of our members worked closely together and contributed their own strength to solve the problem.”
School of Computer Science Cybersecurity Researchers Are Securing the Future
Cybersecurity affects everything from policy to technology. Georgia Tech is at the forefront of many of these conversations on attribution and government responsibility. None of these discussions would be possible, though, without secure systems the public can rely on. In the School of Computer Science, we identify emerging threats and create these systems to defend against them.
New attacks
Keeping a pulse on the latest attack methods is one of our strengths. In order to create a more secure world, we must imagine threats outside of traditional devices. Yet the depth of our expertise ensures we also stay on top traditional methods. By tracking all attacks, we can build the necessary solutions.
Internet of things (IoT) devices let us control the temperature of our home or track the food in our fridge from afar, but they are often built on simple software stacks. “All of these things were never meant to be connected to anything, so there is no notion of security when the code was designed and that creates a lot of vulnerabilities,” Professor Milos Prvulovic said.
One such vulnerability is side channels, the electromagnetic fields the device deploys when computation runs. An attacker can monitor these side channels to determine how a program runs down to when the program deploys a cryptokey and steal it. Yet Prvulovic surveys these side channels, too, determining whether a device is running expected programs and then updating it with more secure software. Prvulovic is applying the same technique to hardware. He measures radio frequency signals to determine how much power is going through a chip to ensure that chips operate as they should.
Many attackers still rely on classic phishing, but are trying more sophisticated techniques to monetize successful attacks. For example, the notorious tech support scammers use search poisoning and malicious advertisements to get victims to call them. These attacks employ both online and phone channels or cross-channels. Professor Mustaque Ahamad researches how to understand and defend against cross-channel attacks. Securing voice channels is a growing cybersecurity field as voice-controlled IoT devices become common.
New defenses
Much of our work is preventative. We secure data users already have. The first step in data protection is authenticating users, and biometrics are the best tool. “It’s based on who you are, not what you know,” said Professor Wenke Lee. This real-time Captcha offers new ways to authenticate users, but still has shortcomings. Lee is working on how to preserve the privacy of biometrics so that if a server were compromised, an attacker couldn’t use the stolen data to impersonate users.
Securing the cloud is the next frontier. Associate Professor Alexandra Boldyreva works on searchable encryption. Users would be able to securely store data remotely on the cloud and perform searches. She also analyzes the cryptographic security guarantees of the newest networking and web authentication protocols. Associate Professor Vladimir Kolesnikov studies secure computation. This form of cryptography protects users’ data during computation, so they can securely share healthcare data or private blockchain transactions. With the latter, users can verify they have enough money in their wallets for transactions without having to disclose the exact amount.
New advances
We combine our attack forecasting and prevention measures in our research labs. Our malware analysis lab offers a secure environment to run malware. Analysts can collaboratively explore and enumerate malware behaviors, which is a much more efficient effort than the current industry practice of reverse engineering malware in silos.
We are securing machine learning (ML) with a similar approach. Hackers can introduce dirty training data to corrupt an ML model or morph malware to evade an ML model. To combat adversarial ML, Lee’s team measures how robust a model is. They are creating an open source framework for researchers to test their models’ strengths and improve their robustness.
Not all of this automation is bad. Assistant Professor Taesoo Kim sees the future of cybersecurity “as autonomous systems that assist human security experts handling large-scale security problems with small number of experts.” With this in mind, he’s been working on automated techniques to find bugs and cyber reasoning systems that create autonomous attack and defenses.
Our efforts may be wide-ranging, but we are consistently creating the future of cybersecurity. Our cybersecurity researchers patch vulnerabilities in devices many didn’t even realize attackers compromised and ensure data is secure in our ever-connected world. Trust is a hard-won concept in the cybersecurity field, but our systems make people more confident their data is safe.
School of Computer Science Researchers Optimize Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is one of the most promising fields in computing, but researchers can’t unlock its full potential without organization and oversight. The School of Computer Science’s database and systems researchers can bridge the gap between effective systems and efficient machine learning.
ML and databases
Our researchers provide structure to machine learning that benefits everyone. “Machine learning researchers mostly think about algorithms and theories, but real-world machine learning applications require a data processing pipeline,” said Assistant Professor Xu Chu.
As a database researcher, he realized that database research techniques can facilitate a ML pipeline. For example, approximation query processing can answer SQL queries quickly on sample data. Similarly, Chu is researching approximate model training on only a portion of the training data instead of burdening a model with the complete dataset.
Yet the relationship is symbiotic. ML can help ensure data is consistent and easy to use, a process known as data cleaning. Traditionally, researchers use rule-based techniques to data clean. Generating these rules is a time-consuming and difficult process, so Chu is exploring ML-based techniques that leverage the statistical distributions of data used in cleaning.
ML and systems
Systems also play a vital role in the predictive elements of ML. “Machine learning is still in its infancy from a systems perspective,” Professor Ling Liu said. Our researchers have found ways to build systems for ML and ML for systems that improve performance universally.
Associate Professor Hyesoon Kim boosts the coverage and accuracy of distributed ML systems. Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as thermostats or security cameras, rely on ML to detect anomalies in data. Yet analyzing the data on a main company’s server or the cloud could compromise security. Distributing the work across IoT devices allows researchers to do computations faster with less power.
Liu creates new systems optimization techniques and libraries for more effective ML. She also develops enhanced ML models and algorithms to improve the performance of cloud systems. This systems for ML and ML for systems perspective is only the start of her research.
Despite the power of ML, it must be used responsibly. Liu wants to bring awareness to the need for fairness, privacy, trust, and accountability of algorithmic decision-making in ML and AI. “We need to encourage innovation in diverse ML algorithms that can extract features and learn different hidden correlations and perspectives over the same datasets,” Liu said. “It is also important to leverage ML as a valuable reference point, rather than the sole factor in decision-making.”
Our hybrid expertise builds stronger ML that can be used in all areas of computing.
School of Computer Science Researchers Innovate on the Edge of Computing
The future of computing is on the edge. The cloud allows the development of complex applications but has its limitations. Video processing, image recognition, and other computation need a closer server for improved latency, security, and cost. School of Computer Science researchers are leveraging existing devices at the edge of the network, a practice known as fog or edge computing.
To understand why the edge is so innovative, one must understand the understand the history of networks. “For a long time, we would compute on our own machines that were owned by one organization,” said Professor Ellen Zegura. “What’s so revolutionary about the cloud is it allows access to the process in a much more accessible, cheaper, and widely used way.” But what if the cloud is too far or access is intermittent? This is where edge computing comes in because it allows computation to be spread on existing mobile devices.
Relying on the edge
The two biggest issues with this effort are breaking the computing down into transitive pieces and then ensuring they return. Networking Professors Mostafa Ammar and Zegura predict the churn of devices and how reliable the network will be. They have been attacking this problem from multiple angles, such as using mobile servers and femtoclouds. The latter is a mobile self-configuring cloud made from a cluster of mobile devices that provides a reliable compute service despite the churn of its devices.
Edge computing offers a lot of performance advantages, but there are challenges when harnessing a distributed network. One of the strengths of the cloud is its reliability, but ensuring multiple edge nodes also have this reliability is more complicated. Professor Umakishore Ramachandran approaches the edge from a systems angle.
His research ensures that if one node loses power, the computation isn’t lost, but also it isn’t distributed so far that latency suffers. One of the ways he’s working on improving the resilience of the edge is through Georgia Tech’s campus security camera network. He believes anomaly detection could be done in real-time if nodes tracked all vehicles and set a time bound on their activities. Ultimately, Georgia Tech Police wouldn’t need to save all video and could respond faster because the edge nodes could process the footage for threats faster.
Trusting the edge
Securing data is another benefit of edge computing. As a systems researcher, Associate Professor Ada Gavrilovska realized all the edge’s advantages for scalability and latency wouldn’t matter if data weren’t secure. However, securing the edge in the same way as the cloud made it too slow, so she and Research Scientist Ketan Bhardwaj built an edge security solution that uses a security feature in commodity hardware. Once a user can trust the edge, they can put critical services there, such as security for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. “I want to use the edge to make these applications faster, more scalable, and more efficient in how they use resources,” she said.
SCS professors are only just scratching the surface of how revolutionary edge computing could be. The edge can bring computing everywhere, from ensuring self-driving cars have the most up-to-date information to keeping communities connected to the network during a natural disaster. “The vision of edge computing is limited; they say it’s a slave to the cloud, but the story is more compelling than that,” said Ramachandran. “It’s about creating a level playing field and having autonomy on the edge for decision-making.”
Pioneering Associate Chair H. Venkateswaran Retires
H. Venkateswaran, known as Venkat, pioneered the role of associate chair for graduate education to better serve graduate students in the School of Computer Science (SCS). The SCS faculty member, who has been with Georgia Tech for the last 32 years, has always seen himself as an advocate for students.
“It happened organically because I liked interacting with students,” he said. “Going through a Ph.D. program is stressful. Students need to know how to navigate through the system by satisfying milestone requirements in a timely manner while conducting dissertation research, and that life doesn’t go in a straight line. I wanted to be of as much help as possible.”
Working with students
Venkat joined Georgia Tech in 1986 and established himself as a student resource early on. He always enjoyed teaching because he got to interact with students and challenge himself.
“Every time I’d walk into a new class, I’d feel nervous because even though I may be comfortable with the subject material, there could still be students who could ask me something I didn’t know,” he said. “Teaching curious students is like having the chance to become young again and again.”
Ultimately, he wanted to inspire students to learn rather than just transfer his knowledge. This respect for students made him a natural fit for a role as Ph.D. coordinator in the College of Computing, where he managed all aspects of the CS Ph.D. program in the College following the path laid by his predecessors in that role.
Becoming associate chair
When SCS was created in 2007, though, this type of role didn’t transfer directly to the school even though it was vital. Students are the lifeblood of the school, but if they don’t have a strong support system, the school won’t be healthy. Professor Eric Vigoda, who was SCS’s associate chair at the time in a different capacity, and SCS Chair Lance Fortnow knew this and wanted to create an associate chair for graduate education position to help students. Given his prior experience in the College, Venkat was the perfect person for the job.
However, being an associate chair was a much larger responsibility than Ph.D. coordinator. Venkat was in charge of everything related to graduate education in the school, including managing admissions and curriculum issues for both master’s and Ph.D. degrees. This entailed ensuring students got matched with the right advisor, completed degree milestones in time, and were assigned teaching assistantships. He also reviewed new courses to confirm they fulfilled curriculum requirements.
Yet the main task was offering a support system to students. Venkat had an open-door policy, and students would come in for advice about everything from what classes to take next to what to do if their advisor left the school.
Venkat’s success in the role was evident to everyone.
“When Venkat took on responsibility for graduate students, it was as if he had come home,” Professor Ellen Zegura said. “His steady and careful approach was a perfect fit for the needs of the school and the students.”
The other schools took note, too, and now the schools of Interactive Computing and Computational Science and Engineering also have associate chairs for graduate education.
Leaving a legacy
In preparation for his retirement at the end of December, Venkat stepped down from the role in August and passed the torch to Associate Professor Alexandra Boldyreva. He looks forward to spending more time with his family and also getting back into his research in computational complexity.
Venkat is passionate about this work in one of the foundational areas in computer science. Of his many contributions to the field, one of the most influential was finding new ways to model complexity classes, which gave deeper insights into efficient computation.
“His algebraic circuit characterization of the class #P, which counts the number of solutions to search problems, helped set the stage for understanding the surprising power of interactive proof systems,” Fortnow said.
Yet, for Venkat, Tech was never about only research. It was about the people and helping them see just how special it was to be part of the Institute.
“The secret is this is a very good place, where researchers can set their eyes on what they want to accomplish and do it here,” he said. “There are no blocks, no constraints. You can contribute to your growth and the growth of the place.”
Assistant Professor Dhruv Batra Earns Prestigious ECASE-Army Award
School of Interactive Computing Assistant Professor Dhruv Batra was recently selected as a recipient of the prestigious Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (ECASE-Army) by the Army Research Office, providing five years’ worth of research funding to make artificial intelligence (AI) systems more transparent, explainable, and trustworthy.
The award, which provides a total of $1 million over the course of the grant, comes as a result of Batra’s selection for a similar early-career award by the Army Research Office Young Investigator Program in 2014.
The research Batra’s lab will pursue with the funding addresses a fundamental challenge in development of AI – their “black-box” nature, the consequent difficulty humans face in identifying why or how AI systems fail, and how to improve upon those technologies. When a self-driving car from a major tech company, for example, suffered its first fatality in 2015, legal and regulatory agencies understandably questioned what went wrong. The challenge at the time was providing a sufficient answer to that question.
“Your response can’t just be, ‘Well, there was this machine learning box in there, and it just didn’t detect the car. We don’t know why,’” said Batra, who is also a member of the Machine Learning and GVU Centers.
Batra’s research aims to create AI systems that can more readily explain what they do and why. This could come in the form of natural language or visual explanations, both of which – computer vision and natural language processing – are central areas of focus in Batra’s lab. The machine could, for example, identify regions in image that provide support for its predictions, potentially assisting a user’s understanding of what the machine can or cannot do.
It’s an important area of study for a few reasons, Batra said. He classifies AI technology into three levels of maturity:
- Level 1 is technology that is in its infancy. It is not near deployment to everyday users, and the consumers of the technology are researchers. The goal for transparency and explanation is to help researchers and developers to understand the failure modes and current limitations, and deduce how to improve the technology – “actionable insight,” as Batra called it.
- Level 2 is when things are working to a degree, enough so that the technology can and has been deployed.
“The technology may be mature in a narrow range, and you can ship the product,” Batra said. “Like face detection or fingerprint technology. It’s built into products and being used at agencies, airports, or other places.”
In such cases, you want explanations and interpretability that helps build appropriate trust with users. Users can understand when the system reliably works and when it might not work – face detection in bad lighting, for example – and make efforts to use in a more appropriate setting.
- Level 3 is typically a fairly narrow category where the AI is better – sometimes significantly so – than the human. Batra used chess-playing and Go-playing bots as an example. The best chess-playing bots convincingly outperform the best humans and reliably hand a resounding defeat to the average human player.
“We already know bots play much better than humans,” he said. “In such cases, you don’t need to improve the machine and you already trust its skill level. You want the machine to give you explanations not so that you can improve the AI, but so that you can improve yourself.”
Batra envisions scenarios where the techniques his lab develops could assist at all three levels, but the experiments will take place between Levels 1 and 2. They will work in Visual Question Answering, which are agents that answer natural language questions about visual content, and other areas of maturity that may reach the product level in five or more years.
The funding will begin for Batra in January. Batra has served as an assistant professor at Georgia Tech since Fall 2016. Visit his website for more information about his research.
Georgia Tech Researchers Working To Improve Fairness in the ML Pipeline
Georgia Tech researchers have developed a new algorithm to mitigate bias from one of the first steps in the machine learning (ML) process. Known as fair principal component analysis (PCA), the new algorithm runs as fast as existing PCAs, but can reduce bias in low-dimensional representations of large datasets.
Bias is one of the most pressing issues as ML is used for everything from image classification to determining loans. Although there are plenty of stories about obvious bias like ML algorithms only showing images of white men when asked to query the term “CEO,” much of the bias is more insidious.
Many researchers believe unfair ML is the result of biased data or faulty algorithms, but Tech researchers determined it can start as early as the data processing step.
Reducing the dimension, increasing bias
Data with high dimension is often the start of the problem. When a dataset needs to be mathematically represented, each feature is represented as one dimension. For example, a 200x200-pixel image transforms into a vector with 40,000 dimensions. Working with such a large representation is often too difficult to process efficiently, so computer scientists use standard PCA to reduce the dimension while keeping as much information from the original data set as possible.
PCA runs by looking for the main directions that the data is distributed and projects the data onto those directions. Scientists then evaluate the accuracy by determining how far the projection is from the original data or how much information is being lost.
Although this makes the data easier to work with, the low-dimensional representation can be biased, according to the researchers. They ran PCA on a dataset of 1,300 images of males and females and calculated the average error for the different populations. The male population always was more accurate than the female.
“If you’re already representing one population much better at the preprocessing step, it injects some bias no matter what you’re trying to do,” School of Computer Science (SCS) Ph.D. student Samira Samadi said.
Reducing bias
One way to combat this bias is to have a definition of what a fair projection means. The researchers evaluate this through marginal error, which determines how far the output projection is from the best projection for each population in the data. They concluded the maximum marginal error must be low for both populations, or equal, to be considered fair.
This became the basis for the new fair PCA algorithm.
“If you use PCA and care about fairness, now you can use fair PCA,” Samadi said.
The researchers presented the work at one of the leading machine learning conferences of the year, the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), in Montreal Dec. 2-8. Samadi co-authored the paper, The Price of Fair PCA: One Extra Dimension, with SCS Ph.D. student Uthaipon (Tao) Tantipongpipat, School of Industrial and Systems Engineering Associate Professor Mohit Singh, SCS Assistant Professor Jamie Morgenstern, and SCS Professor Santosh Vempala.
Data Science Expert Jeannette Wing Delivers Mary Jean Harrold Memorial Distinguished Lecture
Data science is the future, and it must be used responsibly. This was the message of Professor Jeannette Wing’s lecture, Data for Good: Data Science at Columbia. The Columbia University computer science professor delivered the Mary Jean Harrold Memorial Distinguished Lecture on Dec. 7.
Named after former School of Computer Science (SCS) Professor Mary Jean Harrold, the lecture honors women in computing who are changing the field.
“We started this as a memorial to Mary Jean to find a lecturer who would really capture her excellence for service and spirit,” SCS Professor Dana Randall said in her introduction. “Jeannette has had an incredibly distinguished career.”
Wing is the Avanessians Director of Columbia’s Data Science Institute (DSI). She has also served as corporate vice president of Microsoft Research, assistant director of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate at the National Science Foundation, and chair of the Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science. Her research spans a wide breadth of computer science—including programming languages, software engineering, security, and distributed systems—all areas that are vital to data science.
DSI is comprised of 300 affiliated faculty in 12 schools, touching degrees in cybersecurity, smart cities, media, and more. Its mission is to advance research, bring data science to all fields, and ensure data is being used ethically.
“We have a chance with data science to get it right, and I think it’s important to start teaching data ethics from day one,” Wing said.
Wing’s institute is part of an international focus on data science, and Georgia Tech is also contributing to the conversation. Randall co-leads the Institute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS) to connect industry, academia, and government to our data science expertise and work on big data problems together.
SCS Professor Ellen Zegura makes sure students incorporate responsible data science into their work. She has created the Computing for Good program to bring students into the communities they’re studying, works with Serve-Learn-Sustain to provide tools for using data in the classroom, co-leads a data summer program for college students from across the country, and is studying how to bring care to data science research.
Wing discussed how ethics must be applied to the entire data science process, as follows:
- Generating data. Everything from sensors to cameras generates data. It’s vital that researchers know companies and other third parties can find value in this data and use it to their advantage.
- Processing data. In this stage, data is wrangled, cleaned, compressed, encrypted, and managed to make it easier to use. Throughout this process, data must be kept secure.
- Interpreting data. Data is only useful when analyzed. Data visualization gives a narrative to what the data means, and the story researchers tell can alter how that data is used.
Wing believes it’s fundamental that academics embed ethics in all parts of the process.
“It is academia’s reasonability to understand the fundamentals of why the world works or why something we engineer works,” Wing said. “Industry doesn’t have time to step back and figure it out. If we don’t have the academics thinking beyond deep learning, then it’s not good for the entire community.”
'Human Rights' May Help Shape Artificial Intelligence in 2019
Georgia Tech experts highlight the need to address bias and transparency in the ongoing debate about the role of AI
Ethics and accountability will be among the most significant challenges for artificial intelligence (AI) in 2019, according to a survey of researchers at Georgia Tech’s College of Computing.
In response to an email query about AI developments that can be expected in 2019, most of the researchers – whether talking about machine learning (ML), robotics, data visualizations, natural language processing, or other facets of AI – touched on the growing importance of recognizing the needs of people in AI systems.
“In 2019, I hope we will see AI researchers and practitioners start to frame the debate about proper and improper uses of artificial intelligence and machine learning in terms of human rights,” said Associate Professor Mark Riedl.
[RELATED: Is AI Coming For My Job?]
“More and more, interpretability and fairness are being recognized as critical issues to address to ensure AI appropriately interacts with society,” said Ph.D. student Fred Hohman.
Addressing algorithmic bias
Questions about the rights of end-users of AI-enabled services and products are becoming a priority, but Riedl said more is needed.
“Companies are making progress in recognizing that AI systems may be biased in prejudicial ways. However, we need to start talking about the next step: remedy. How do people seek remedy if they believe an AI system made a wrong decision?” said Riedl.
Assistant Professor Jamie Morgenstern sees algorithmic bias as an ongoing concern in 2019 and gave banking as an example of an industry that may be in the news for poor AI-based decision-making.
“I project that we’ll have more high-profile examples of financial systems that use machine learning having worse rates of lending to women, people of color, and other communities historically underrepresented in the ‘standard’ American economic system,” Morgenstern said.

In recent years corporate responses to cases of bias have been hit or miss, but Assistant Professor Munmun De Choudhury said 2019 may see a shift in how tech companies balance their shareholders’ interests with the interests of their customers and society.
[RELATED: Researchers Working To Improve Fairness in the ML Pipeline]
“Companies will be increasingly subject to governmental regulation and will be forced to come up with safeguards to address misuse and abuse of their technologies, and will even consider broader partnerships with their market competitors to achieve this. For some corporations, business interests may take a backseat to ethics until they regain customer trust,” said De Choudhury.
Working toward more transparency
One way companies can regain that trust is through sharing their algorithms with the public, our experts said.
“Developers tend to walk around feeling objective because ‘it’s the algorithm that is determining the answer’. Moving forward, I believe that the algorithms will have to be increasingly ‘inspectable’ and developers will have to explain their answers,” Executive Associate Dean and Professor Charles Isbell.
Ph.D. student Yuval Pinter agreed. In the coming year, “I think we will see that researchers are trying to [develop] techniques and tests that can help us to better understand what’s going on in the actual wiring of our very fancy machine learning models.
“This is not only for curiosity but also because legal applications or regulation in various countries are starting to require that algorithmic decision-making programs be able to explain why they are doing what they are doing,” said Pinter.
Regents’ Professor Ron Arkin believes that these concerns are becoming more central precisely because artificial intelligence will continue to grow in importance in our everyday lives.
[RELATED: Who's Behind the Wheel?]
“Despite continued hype and omnipresent doomsayers, panic and fear over the growth of AI and robotics should begin to subside in 2019 as the benefits to people’s lives are becoming more apparent to the world.
“However, I expect to see lawyers jumping into the fray so we may also see lawsuits determining policy for self-driving cars [and other applications] more so than government regulation or the legal system,” said Arkin.
Seeing is Believing: Atlanta Ranks #7 for STEM Professionals
Georgia Tech takes an interactive look at city rankings for tech-related job seekers
Choosing a job based on its location is never easy. This is particularly true for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals who often have multiple job offers in different cities.
But thanks to a new data visualization created by Georgia Tech, comparing the 100 largest metro areas in the United States just got a whole lot easier.
The interactive tool visualizes data compiled and published by personal finance site WalletHub, which was featured in a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution story. It allows users to easily navigate and understand the rankings for each city in three categories: professional opportunities, STEM-friendliness, and quality of life.
According to the data, Atlanta ranks as the #7 top city in the U.S. for STEM professionals. The city ranks #1 for job openings for STEM graduates per capita and #2 for the quality of engineering opportunities.
New DARPA Award to Improve Software and Hardware Co-optimization
Georgia Tech researchers have been awarded $4.5 million to build new programming systems for developing data-intensive algorithms with automatic software and hardware co-optimization. The project is named Dynamic Data-Aware Reconfiguration, INtegration and Generation (DDARING).
School of Computer Science Professors and Co-Directors of the Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH) Vivek Sarkar and Tom Conte and School of Computational Science and Engineering’s Chair David Bader and Associate Professor Richard Vuduc are co-investigators on this project from Tech. The award will also be used to support research collaborators at University of Illinois, University of Michigan, and University of Southern California.
“This is a unique opportunity to address post-Moore computing challenges through new research on software and hardware co-optimization by adapting the hardware to executing applications and the data sets being analyzed,” said Sarkar. “Advancing data analysis algorithms and pushing the boundaries of hardware are areas of strength for Georgia Tech, and we’re excited to work with our partners at Illinois, Michigan, and USC on this important challenge for future computing platforms.”
The project is part of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s (DARPA) Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI), a five-year upwards of $1.5 billion investment in the future of domestic electronic systems. Building on the tradition of other successful government-industry partnerships, ERI aims to forge forward-looking collaborations among the commercial electronics community, defense industrial base, university researchers, and the Department of Defense. They expect to create a more specialized, secure, and heavily automated electronics industry that serves the needs of both the domestic commercial and defense sectors. Tech researchers will work under the Software Defined Hardware (SDH) program, which creates malleable hardware/software architectures that allow an application to defer hardware configuration to runtime.
This research seeks to enable developers to easily create applications while the new system automatically optimizes their performance on new and emerging architectures. These improvements will make architectures more energy efficient for data analytics applications, including those in the machine learning and artificial intelligence domains.
“Under this program, our project should make programming next-generation hardware easy and productive,” said Bader. “We are looking at novel software and hardware co-design that lets users rapidly take advantage of new architectural features.”
The program goals also fit with CRNCH’s mission to find new paths forward in this post-Moore’s law age, when the number of transistors on a chip cannot be expected to double every 1.5 to 2 years, as it has for decades.
Fairness in Machine Learning Conference Comes to Atlanta
Fairness in machine learning (ML) is becoming one of the most pressing issues in society. This week, more than 500 people are in Atlanta for the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT) conference, Jan. 29 through 31, to discuss improving ethics in ML.
As more and more products and services come to rely on artificial intelligence and ML, ethical issues continue to arise. According to School of Computer Science Assistant Professor Jamie Morgenstern, who is one of the conference's program chairs, this is because much of the data used to train these systems is historical and often reflects societal biases of the time.
[RELATED: Jamie Morgenstern Wants to Bring Fairness to Machine Learning]
The FAT conference was established to mitigate these issues by developing awareness of this inherent bias. Morgenstern defines each term as follows:
- Fairness: This can be called predictive equity. Systems should do a similarly good job of improving services for all groups.
- Accountability: Researchers should be able to explain why computational systems behave the way they do.
- Transparency: A system should be understandable to the population it will serve.
Because these issues impact more than just computer science, and ML now touches everything from policy to business, conference attendees include lawyers, policymakers, and a variety of industry representatives.
“If we’re just having this conversation ourselves as computer scientists, we will invariably get it wrong,” Morgenstern said. “We want to promote a broad, diverse population to come together, network, and be externally visible in this field.”
[RELATED: 'Human Rights' May Help Shape Artificial Intelligence in 2019]
Now in its second year, the FAT conference is affiliated with ACM this year. The program chairs are Morgenstern and Data & Society founder and Microsoft Research Principal Researcher danah boyd [styled lower case]. Local Chairs Professor Deven Desai of Georgia Tech's Scheller College of Business, and Brandeis Marshall of Spelman College have also been critical to the conference’s mission.
Georgia Tech also has a paper at the conference: A Taxonomy of Ethical Tensions in Inferring Mental Health States from Social Media by School of Interactive Computing (IC) Ph.D. student Stevie Chancellor, Dr. Michael Birnbaum, University of Rochester Professor Eric Caine, Associate Professor Vincent Silenzio, and IC Assistant Professor Munmun De Choudhury.
See and Say: Abhishek Das Working to Provide Crucial Communication Tools for Intelligent Agents
School of Interactive Computing Ph.D. student Abhishek Das remembers the moment his interests in computer vision and language began to come into focus. It was early in his time as a Ph.D. student when he came across an algorithm that could generate a one-line natural language description of an image with incredible accuracy. When he saw the results, it seemed almost magical, he said.
“I was blown away because you could give it any image, and it would generate a fairly plausible sentence,” he said. “I had never seen that before.”
Six months later, there were papers being published on question answering, where the algorithm could not only generate a sentence but could even answer questions about the image. He was similarly floored by the impressive results.
He was advised by Dhruv Batra and also working closely with Devi Parikh, both assistant professors at Virginia Tech at the time. When they joined Georgia Tech, Das brought his thirst for research in that space to Atlanta, as well. Now, nearly two years later, he has published a number of research papers in projects ranging from visual dialogue to a task called “embodied question answering.” He is working toward additional research involving multiple agents, and sees a world not far off that takes advantage of all of this simulated research to develop hardware for assistive tech like in-home robots.
'It feels within reach...'
It’s a future that has been featured in popular culture for years – think about Rosie, the robot maid who first appeared on The Jetsons in 1962 – but is one that Das is beginning to see on the horizon.
“It feels within reach, the vision that we see in science fiction,” he said. “Movies of robots that you can talk to or give instructions to.”
While people outside of the research sphere may just see the cold steel exterior of these imagined robots, it requires so many different elements to develop a viable foundation. This includes work in computer vision, which involves analysis of visual information by a machine, and language, which involves written or verbal communication and instruction. Das works at the intersection of both domains.
Broadly, his research has been in developing algorithms and intelligent agents that can see, talk, and ultimately act on that understanding in physical environments, taking actions like navigation or executing instructions.
Findings from a recent research project were published and presented at the 2018 Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference in Salt Lake City, Utah. They explored an idea called embodied question answering. In this project, there is an agent that is asked a question and must ascertain an answer by moving through and inquiring about other aspects of its environment.
“It combines these three modalities: computer vision, language understanding, and reinforcement learning to take actions in this environment,” Das said.
The application here could be an assistive robot that could take a question or a command – “Where are my keys,” for example – and provide an answer or perform a task based on its understanding of the environment. He’s also conducting similar work with multiple agents, which could help coordinate to perform certain tasks.
“I’m not currently working with the hardware side of things,” he said. “All of this is simulation, but these are the end goals. The vision is that these will make it to robots with these sorts of capabilities. And, more importantly, the algorithms that I’m building will hopefully generalize and be useful for a wide variety of tasks.”
A culture of collaboration
Das’ work has received extensive media attention and he has had the opportunity to work under some prestigious grants and fellowships. Currently, he is supported by fellowships from Facebook, Adobe, and Snap. He was recently awarded fellowships from Facebook, Microsoft Research, NVIDIA. He declined the latter two and accepted Facebook.
One of the great benefits, he said, of working at Georgia Tech in this space has been the opportunity to collaborate with individuals who are conducting research in complementary domains.
“On my floor in the College of Computing, there are people who are experts in computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, in robotics, or other areas, and it’s always awesome to bounce ideas off of them,” he said.
“Just this semester, I was taking (Associate Professor) Sonia Chernova’s course in human-robot interaction, and we prototyped a version of a tabletop embodied robot that could actually implement a very primitive version of the embodied question answering algorithm. That was a very interesting experience.”
Das is gaining new valuable experience this semester, as well. Having interned three times at Facebook AI Research, he is spending this semester in London interning with DeepMind, where he will work in areas related to this general space of agents that can see, talk, and act.
CS Professor Building Community One Cup of Coffee at a Time
Every Monday afternoon you can find Professor Umakishore Ramachandran with new faculty around him in the School of Computer Science (SCS) lounge. These coffee breaks are a good time for junior professors to bring questions and concerns, but they’re also a chance to build community.
“Every situation is like a family,” Ramachandran said. “When we get new faculty in, it’s like growing the family. I want to make sure they feel they have a place in the family. If they feel they’re part of the family, then they will start doing more for it.”
Encouraging collegiality
Ramachandran has always valued community. When he started at Georgia Tech in 1986, the department was so small that it inherently felt close-knit. He remembers everyone eating lunch together daily or catching up over the 10-cent coffee in the lounge.
“We had such a vibrant research community environment, and there was always conversation happening,” he said. “Now it’s more common that people come into the office, go teach, do their own research, then go home.”
When a college grows from 18 faculty members to more than 100, some fragmentation is expected, but Ramachandran has tried to bring back that sense of collegiality and collaboration. It often starts with the newest faculty.
Building community
Ramachandran served as the recruiting chair for several consecutive terms in the 1990s and 2000s, and saw the challenges new professors face when starting at a different institution. Many assistant professors have never held a faculty position before and need help recruiting students for research, writing grant proposals, integrating their previous research with new endeavors, and finding ways to gain visibility in the wider computing community. Despite the learning curve, many new professors don’t ask for help, Ramachandran realized.
“People feel reticent to just barge into others’ offices because they’re concerned if someone has time,” he said. “Many new faculty may not feel comfortable asking for help.”
This is where Ramachandran’s weekly coffee gathering came from. There isn’t an agenda for these meetings because Ramachandran believes the most productive brainstorming sessions often happen when things are kept open.
“When intelligent people meet, good ideas happen automatically,” Ramachandran said.
New Assistant Professor David Devecsery regularly attends these meetings and has found the guidance invaluable for settling at Tech.
“Kishore's experience and knowledge is an invaluable resource,” he said. “If I ever want to get something done, Kishore is one of the first people I ask about how to best accomplish it.
Fostering collaboration
This was why Ramachandran hosted SCS’s first Edge Computing Summit last semester. Although many professors were working on edge computing research, they weren’t working together. Ramachandran wanted to put them in the same room to create new projects and strengthen Tech’s work in the field.
Each presenter gave a short talk about their research followed by a panel where they discussed potential joint efforts. This collaborative format was unique for a summit, and Ramachandran hopes to host more brainstorming sessions this semester to get faculty partnering on new projects.
Whether he’s mentoring new professors or making sure everyone collaborates, the goal is to create a healthy community.
“It’s about how you create a culture where you naturally start thinking about how to give back,” Ramachandran said. “There’s an innate desire to do good in everybody, it’s just creating the channel.”
More Than 120 Students Participate in Interactivity@GT 2019
Georgia Tech hosted its annual Interactivity event on Jan. 31 in the Historic Academy of Medicine.
More than 120 students and representatives from 61 companies participated in the annual showcase and job fair for graduate students enrolled in one of three master’s programs at Georgia Tech – M.S. in Human-Computer Interaction, M.S. in Digital Media, and Master of Industrial Design.
New this year, Interactivity, which is presented by the GVU Center and sponsored by Mailchimp, included a traditional job fair. Eighteen companies participated in the fair, which was focused specifically on user experience-related jobs.
“Interactivity is unique because it provides a one-stop shop for companies looking for world-class HCI and UX talent,” said Dick Henneman, a professor of the practice in the School of Interactive Computing and the Director of the MS-HCI program. “We experimented this year by including a traditional career fair for our MS-HCI, MID, and MSDM students. Judging by the reaction from both students and company recruiters, it was a huge hit that will continue in the future.”As in past years, Interactivity kicked off with a morning poster session for students to share research projects with visiting industry partners. After lunch, students took part in “one-minute madness,” an opportunity for each student to take the stage and give a one-minute elevator pitch about themselves, their interests, and their work.
Interactivity has proven successful over the years for students looking to enter industry as a STEM professional. Since 2014-18, in fact, more than 50 percent of graduates from the MS-HCI program took jobs at major companies in five of the top 10 metro areas for STEM professionals – 28.7 percent to Atlanta, 15.8 percent to San Francisco, Calif., and 6.4 percent to Seattle, Wash.

Students, Staff Step Up at Super Bowl
Drones Used in Halftime Show "Just Went Nuts" Day Before the Big Game
Rising high above the crowd to spell out “LOVE”, the illuminated paper lantern performance was a highlight for many watching the Super Bowl LIII Halftime Show.
The performance went off without a hitch. But for a few moments the day before the big game, a successful outcome seemed less than certain.
Georgia Tech College of Computing undergraduate students Christopher Payne and Anna Klaussen were among a handful of people from the GT Computing community that were either volunteering or working during Super Bowl LIII.
“Saturday, the day before the Super Bowl, I don’t know what happened but the drones just went completely nuts,” said Payne.
Glitch before the big game
Payne and Klaussen volunteered as “trays” supporting the illuminated lantern performance. The trays’ assignments were to place each of the 155 lanterns – all attached to a drone and carried on a plastic tray – on its specific spot.
Rehearsals at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and the Georgia World Congress Center had gone smoothly during the previous two weeks. During one of the last rehearsals the day before the game, however, a glitch caused the drones to respond improperly.
“Half of them didn’t leave the ground, some went a few feet up and came down, but there were a couple that just went straight up to the roof of Mercedes-Benz Stadium and then came crashing down,” said Payne, a fourth-year computational media major.
Possible coding change
He said he thinks the Intel team responsible for programming the drone swarm was trying to save a step.
“Part of our job had been to retrieve the drones when they landed. I think they were trying to program them to automatically land back on the trays. But, for whatever reason, the drones did not like the code,” said Payne, who is also minoring in Japanese.
Payne said he heard that the blood visibly drained from the director’s face when this happened. But in the end, the programmers solved the problem by reverting to the previous code, which led to a successful halftime performance.
Payne and Klaussen, a third-year computer science major, heard about the opportunity when Super Bowl organizers put out a call for volunteers through the Georgia Tech School of Music and other performing arts-related units at University System of Georgia institutions.
“I’m in the Glee Club and Anna is in the Marching Band Color Guard. I think they wanted people used to performing, used to rehearsals, and used to taking direction,” said Payne.
Super staff at the Super Bowl
Also performing on Super Bowl Sunday was Patricia Allen, a senior development assistant in the College of Computing. Allen sings with The SEEiT Choir, an Atlanta-based professional choir, which performed on the main stage during the official NFL tailgate party before the game.
“I’ll always remember the energy from the day. The entire experience was amazing.” Allen said. “It was a tremendous joy to have fans asking to take pictures with us and express how wonderful we sounded. I would do this all over again and hopefully, we will!”
While Allen was performing outside, GT Computing staff member Bricesen Ross was inside the Mercedes-Benz Stadium working as a Microsoft contractor.
Ross’s primary responsibility was monitoring the NFL’s digital communication network to prevent any downtime for tablet computers being used on the sidelines and throughout the stadium during the game.
“The initial plan was for me to be on the (New England) Patriots sideline, but 45 minutes prior to the start, I was approved to work in the media control center next to the commissioner's suite,” Ross said.
From this vantage point, Ross said he could see Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, “along with a few other billionaires,” enjoying the game from the commissioner’s suite.
Allie McFadden also spent time in the media center. Part of the College’s communications team, McFadden worked as a member of the NFL’s public relations (PR) staff. Her husband, a member of the Atlanta Falcons communications team, was also part of the gameday PR staff.
“Our team's job was to make sure the press room ran smoothly for every part of the game, especially the post-game,” McFadden said. “We worked with the transcribers and statisticians to make sure journalists had the latest stats, quotes, and player updates. We also helped direct coaches, former players, and other celebrities to the right areas for radio interviews, press conferences, et cetera.”
McFadden said pinning down her favorite memory from volunteering at the Super Bowl was tough.
“Going to the Super Bowl has been on my bucket list for as long as I can remember. Getting to go to the game in my own hometown, and having the opportunity to help it run smoothly, and sharing it all with my husband was pretty cool,” said McFadden.
She added, “We got to go on the field after the game and I’m not going to lie, playing in the confetti was pretty dang fun!”
Also volunteering time to ensure the success of Super Bowl LIII was Andrew Leonard. Leonard is an IT Support Professional II on the College team and a GT Computing alumnus. He volunteered several hours as part of the Super Bowl Street Crew responsible for greeting and assisting Super Bowl visitors at city venues including Centennial Olympic Park.
Team of Researchers Headed to SXSW EDU to Discuss VR in Education
Classrooms in Cobb County, Ga., are using virtual reality (VR) to venture inside plant cells. Students in Mumbai, India, are using VR to explore the Louvre Museum. But are the learning outcomes actually better for the kids?
Georgia Tech and Stanford University researchers will discuss this and other crucial questions about the benefits and challenges of using VR in the classroom during a panel next month at South by Southwest EDU (SXSW EDU) 2019.
The panel, Virtually Real: Using Immersive Tech in Education, is set for 5 p.m. March 4 in Room 11AB of the Austin Convention Center. Further information about the panel can be found here. It will feature Georgia Tech’s Neha Kumar and Tamara Pearson, Stanford’s Aditya Vishwanath, and Cobb County Schools’ Sally Creel.
Teachers, school administrators, and others attending the panel can expect a lively and insightful discussion. The panelists will use their research findings from the Cobb County and Mumbai projects as a springboard to discuss:
- Social implications of using VR in the classroom
- Implications for resource-constrained populations
- Physical challenges like dizziness or nausea that can affect users of VR or other immersive technologies
- How to maintain engagement when VR is no longer a novel technology
Along with sharing their research and lessons learned, the panelists hope to have an open conversation with attendees about their experiences, questions, or concerns about using VR in the classroom to improve learning outcomes.
The SXSW EDU Conference & Festival is an annual event that “cultivates and empowers a community of engaged stakeholders to advance teaching and learning.” Along with panel sessions for leading educational experts, the four-day event offers attendees workshops, interactive learning experiences, film screenings, early-stage startups, and business and networking opportunities.

Her current work focuses on partnering with schools and districts to help develop innovative curriculum and programs, as well as understanding how to best engage populations historically underrepresented in STEM fields.
- Sally Creel is the STEM and Innovation supervisor at Cobb County Schools. She coordinated implementation of VR resources in the local schools for the team’s study, including recruiting classrooms and teachers to participate.
College to Host More Than 60 Undergraduate Women for Inaugural I.AM.GradComputing
To support the success of women in computing, Georgia Tech this week is hosting I.AM.GradComputing, a research-focused workshop for undergraduate women in computing.
The inaugural event begins Thursday and is organized by Georgia Tech’s College of Computing, School of Interactive Computing, and the College’s Office of Outreach, Enrollment and Community.
Between 60-70 undergraduate women from institutes located in the Southeast are participating thanks to a gift from Google. Among those schools represented will be Georgia Tech, Kennesaw State, Spelman College, and Agnes Scott College. Attendance is based on acceptance of an application submitted by interested students.
“We are encouraged by the trajectory of women who are electing to pursue graduate degrees in computing, but there’s so much more left to accomplish,” said Ayanna Howard, chair of the School of Interactive Computing and one of the organizers of the event.
“We want to engage with and provide guidance to women in all of these different critical areas like networking and branding and the benefits of a graduate degree. This event is going to be a wonderful opportunity to do that.”
Following a welcome dinner on Thursday, the I.Am.GradComputing workshop will feature a series of sessions on Friday. The sessions will cover relevant topics including:
- Tools and tips on research opportunities
- Networking and personal brand building
- Career planning
- Building self-confidence
- Achieving a healthy work-life balance
Attendees will have an opportunity to engage with experienced women in computing, like Howard, IC faculty members Amy Bruckman, Beki Grinter, Rosa Arriaga, and others.
The goal of the workshop, according to Howard, is to better prepare these women to succeed in computing-related careers, and to ultimately increase the number of undergraduate women pursuing graduate degrees in computing-related fields.
I.AM.GradComputing wraps up Saturday with a hackathon centered around AI for social good. During this event, scheduled for six hours, students will be encouraged to conceptualize or create an artificial intelligence application that addresses a social issue of their choice.
CS Majors Among Entrepreneurs Vying for 2019 InVenture Prize
No matter the field, there are important roles for computer science (CS). The latest evidence of this came last week with the announcement of the 2019 InVenture Prize at Georgia Tech finalists.
Of the six teams vying for the prize on March 13, four include members majoring in CS. In all, there are 10 CS majors participating in this year’s entrepreneurial competition.
“Computer science has become crucial to advancing science and engineering across the board so it makes sense that there are so many CS majors participating in this year’s InVenture Prize finals,” said Monica Sweat, College of Computing senior lecturer and director of the Division of Computing Instruction.
A big chunk of these students are on team Unfoldit, the only team in the finals this year made up exclusively of CS undergraduates.
Developed by second-year CS majors Max Brauer and Ryan Miles, third-year CS major Cliff Panos, and fourth-year CS majors Jackie Elliott and Michael Xu, UnfoldIt is a virtual paper and hole punching game that is designed to test and develop spatial awareness abilities.
The other computer science students participating in the 2019 InVenture Prize at Georgia Tech finals – Austin Condict (Team Finger Flyer), Johnny Maroun and Chris Troung (Team HANDLD), Thomas Olson and Vishwa Shah (Team Nix) – are split among three teams and partnering with students from The Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, and the School of Material Science and Engineering.
Qirun Zhang Believes Software Should Be Reliable for Everyone
When Qirun Zhang was 13, he learned how to program robots. Now he’s a programming languages and software engineering assistant professor in the School of Computer Science, where he’s improving software reliability — not just for robots — but for everyone.
Computing has always been a part of Zhang’s life. His father developed computer chips, giving Zhang early access to the latest machines. He grew up playing computer games on an Intel 486, but it wasn’t until a middle school teacher showed him how to program in visual basic that he realized computer science could be much more than just hobby.
As a teen, Zhang’s interest in programming was about controlling a machine to achieve a goal. That goal was often programming robots to win high school competitions. When he studied computer science as an undergraduate at Zhejiang University, though, he found he loved learning about the theory and fundamentals behind programming as well.
Improving software
Like many computer scientists, Zhang started programming to achieve his own goals, but he wanted to have a bigger impact and decided to pursue a Ph.D. at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
“Rather than taking programming as a profession, I wanted to do something to fundamentally improve reliability of software and improve society,” he said.
Because it’s one of the most fundamental programming problems, Zhang first took on improving software reliability during his Ph.D. and postdoctoral work at University of California, Davis. Zhang pursued this from two angles: static programming analysis and software testing.
As a Ph.D. student, Zhang started looking at static programming analysis. These tools are used to find coding errors and ensure programs are functioning properly according to specifications.
One of the highlights of his work during this time was a compiler testing project that identified thousands of bugs in many of the most popular open source compilers. Zhang personally found more than 300 of the coding errors. From this work, Zhang is listed as one of the contributors to GCC, one of the largest open source compilers.
Zhang focused his postdoc efforts on software testing following these successes. One of the biggest challenges in software testing is modeling software behavior because there isn’t an algorithm that can solve it. Zhang has mitigated this problem by making the analysis model more precise and scalable.
He’s now working to develop a more principled and automatic approach to understanding program behavior, so programmers can know how long it will take to complete a task.
Having a positive impact
During his postdoc, he discovered another way to improve society — teaching.
“I realized that, as computer scientists, we can use our knowledge to impact people and deliver what we have to the next generation,” he said.
Zhang joined Tech for the opportunity to continue his research efforts and teach. Zhang plans to collaborate with faculty in everything from theory to software testing.

Some of the knowledge Zhang shares with his students is about more than just computer science. Zhang believes in teaching critical thinking so students can solve problems that benefit more than just their careers.
Yet a sense of perspective is often just as vital as the research question.
“My Ph.D. advisor Professor Michael Lyu taught me how to stay positive in research and life,” he said. “Staying positive opens up opportunities to overcome challenges, and that’s what I want my students to learn.”
Aditi Shah Sees What Other Coders Don’t
Aditi Shah has always believed that technology can change how people do things because it changed her life.
At 11, Shah was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye condition that left her blind by age 15. However, her visual impairment has not gotten in the way of studying computer science. In fact, as long as she has a computer with a screen reader on it, Shah believes she can code anything.
“It doesn’t matter if you can see or not, what matters is that your code works well,” she said.
Shah graduated with a bachelor’s from Nagindas Khandwala college and master’s from the University of Mumbai, both in India in information technology. She then worked in data security for five years before she decided to pursue her master’s in cybersecurity at Georgia Tech.
Drawn to Tech for its research reputation, Shah wanted to study cybersecurity in an environment that encourages and inspires innovation. Shah said she's finding a lot of inspiration from reading research papers for her classes.
“After reading these research papers, you can come up with a solution no one has thought of,” she said. “That mindset of innovation is missing in industry.”
Innovation mindset
Shah has to constantly innovate because of her disability. Cybersecurity requires her to be able to work on many different computing environments, not all of which are accessible. Many web-based environments, for example, include graphics that a screen reader cannot pick up or require a mouse for operation. If a program isn’t deliberately designed to be accessible, Shah has to figure it out herself.
“You need to get into the details of what it does internally and whether it can be made accessible or not,” she said of her process. “A sighted user will use the environment and forget it, but making things accessible gives me more insight into how things work.”
This has made Shah a master debugger and a big part of why she was so attracted to cybersecurity.
“Your mindset completely changes when you come into cybersecurity — you find holes everywhere you look,” she said. “You look at everything and see how could this be broken.”
Debugging for good
Since she joined Tech in Fall 2018, Shah has been part of the Computing for Good team. Started 10 years ago, this College of Computing initiative develops and deploys sustainable computing solutions for poverty, health, inequality, environment, and injustice.
Currently, Shah is working on the Basic Laboratory Information System (C4G BLIS) project, a system to track patients, specimens, and tests in hospital labs. The system is actively used in dozens of hospitals in Africa. Her efforts have already helped put the project on the cloud and to find and patch security holes in the system.
“She is able to pinpoint and fix bugs in poorly commented code,” said Professor Santosh Vempala, her advisor on the project. “Ironically, her disability appears to make her a clean, elegant, and very effective designer and programmer. Beyond programming, she constantly generates interesting and creative ideas. I can’t help thinking what a wonderful researcher she would be!”
Shah loves any good cybersecurity problem, and she got interested in BLIS because it let her use technology to help people in the same way it has benefited her.
“When you have a disability, you have to succeed, otherwise all you get is sympathy,” Shah said. “I am able to do most things other people can do, and it’s only because of technology.”
New Packet Scheduling Tool is Scalable, Improves Network Speeds
Large networks — from the internet to data centers — need to manage traffic. But as volumes increase, existing tools used to manage the flow of data requests become less effective.
Using a new approach, Georgia Tech College of Computing researchers have created a flexible packet scheduling software system that is scalable, up to 40 times faster than existing tools, and can handle complex scheduling tasks.
Unlike existing tools, the new scheduling system – known as Eiffel – uses a modified priority queue to efficiently rank and re-rank packets.
The power of packet scheduling
Balancing a network’s traffic requires considering a lot of complex factors. If there are too many requests at once, it won’t run efficiently. Yet not all those requests are of the same importance so prioritizing them is essential.
Many networks rely on packet scheduling to handle the volume. When traffic exceeds capacity, packets are queued. Scheduling decides which packet to take next.
School of Computer Science (SCS) Regents’ Professor Mostafa Ammar compares packet scheduling to plumbing.
“If you try to put water in a pipe too fast, it might overflow,” he said. “But if you put the water through a bucket and put a hole in the bucket, it would control the flow. You can make the hole wider or smaller to let it drip at a certain rate.”
As central processing units (CPUs) get more memory, they can handle more requests. Network scheduling techniques, however, have difficulty keeping up because existing scheduling tools weren’t designed to scale to meet growing traffic volumes. They also weren't designed for complex scheduling tasks, like pushing a bank transaction ahead of video streaming request, or with the ability to have performance upgrades.
[RELATED: Mostafa Ammar is Studying the History of the Internet to Find Its Future]
An efficient and flexible system
To increase efficiency, Eiffel uses a modified ranking function with find first set (FFS) bit operation to order packets in the queue based on their rank. To do so, an annotation mode first ranks a packet’s priority, then an enqueuer component calculates its rank and adds it to a queue in order of its priority.
Eiffel also features a dequeuer component that can re-rank packets as needed for certain scheduling algorithms. The team’s novel use of FFS queues allows them to process a large volume of packets without losing any CPU efficiency.
To make Eiffel flexible, researchers introduced new programming language abstractions. These make the program general enough to create ad hoc scheduling policies as needed.
SCS Ph.D. student Ahmed Saeed started this work as part of a Google internship and published a paper on improving a specific scheduling algorithm last year. After his colleagues at Google expressed interest in addressing more complex scheduling issues, too, he made it a focus of his research, leading to Eiffel that improves the efficiency of all scheduling algorithms.
“It really comes down to the number of flows a single server handles,” he said. “If we have a generally efficient building block that can handle large numbers of flows efficiently, we can also provide flexibility to implement multiple scheduling algorithms quite easily.”

The researchers evaluated Eiffel in three network settings to ensure its performance in a variety of scenarios. Depending on the environment, Eiffel performs from five to 40 times better than other scheduling software. Because of this performance, the researchers plan to make Eiffel available as an open source tool.
Saeed will present the paper, Eiffel: Efficient and Flexible Software Packet Scheduling, at USENIX’s Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI) in Boston, Massachusetts, from Feb. 26 to 28. He coauthored it with SCS Ph.D. student Yimeng Zhao, Stephen Fleming Chair for Telecommunications Professor Ellen Zegura, Ammar, Google software engineer Nandita Dukkipati, Google Fellow Amin Vahdat, and Carnegie Mellon Qatar Associate Professor Khaled Harras.
Researchers Use Social Media to Model Stress Following Incidents of Gun Violence on Campus
An algorithm developed by researchers at Georgia Tech can quantify periods of high stress on college campuses and could better inform appropriate responses by counselors, deans of students, faculty, and student populations themselves.
Using Reddit posts following incidents of gun violence on 12 American campuses as a test bed for their algorithm, researchers were able to identify sharp upticks in stress levels in the weeks immediately following these events and also the common words or phrases that increased or decreased during that period.
“You can always make the indirect inference that you’re seeing higher stress levels due to a specific event, like on-campus violence,” said Munmun De Choudhury, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing. “But what does that mean? Currently, we work on our hunches about the level of impact. This work can provide insight into these types of events by quantifying stress levels. What is the impact, and how?”
To study the impact and the algorithm’s ability to detect it, De Choudhury and Georgia Tech Ph.D. student Koustuv Saha brainstormed the types of events that could impact students’ lives the most. They determined something unique and local to their specific campus, like incidents of violence, would offer an abundance of interaction between students on social media.
To be able to measure stress levels in those time periods immediately following these instances, they built a classifier trained on separate control data – unrelated posts of high stress (class, crises, etc.) and low stress (general news, frivolous posts about cats, etc.).
Applying the algorithm to the 12 campus groups, they found that there was, not surprisingly, higher stress surrounding those events. More importantly, though, they were able to identify aspects of that stress that weren’t readily available by the simple knowledge that on-campus violence induces a negative response from students. For example, while “class” was a word that commonly came up in high-stress posts before the incident, in that short period following any discussion of academics significantly dropped. On the other hand, words that were rarely seen throughout the year – social words, like “friends” and “people” – suddenly appeared.
“They were words that indicated concern or solidarity, bonding words,” De Choudhury said. “We can see that there is a different sense of community. All of this is actionable, because if class is not a concern at that time, perhaps we need to adapt things at the campus level that can better meet the students’ needs, like peer support groups or things like that.”
While the approach was tested only for college campuses encountering gun violence, Saha said that he could imagine a similar approach transferring to other settings. The challenge would be adjusting it to account for the size and makeup of the community.
“On campus, they are younger students who already interact on Reddit with each other,” he said. “If you’re talking larger-scale incidents, perhaps nationally, you have a much more diverse community which doesn’t all communicate via the same medium or in the same way.”
This research was published in the paper Modeling Stress with Social Media Around Incidents of Gun Violence on College Campus. It was presented at the 21st ACM Conference on Computer-Support Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW).
Ellen Zegura Becomes New CRA Board Chair
School of Computer Science Professor Ellen Zegura has been named as chair of the Computing Research Association (CRA) Board of Directors.
CRA brings together industry, academia, and government to make computing research advances and strengthen education. Zegura has been a CRA board member since 2011, and an appointed member of the executive committee since 2014. Throughout her tenure, Zegura has served on several CRA committees and co-chaired the 2016 Snowbird conference.
“The CRA board service provides a unique opportunity to work across institutions and sub-disciplines of computing on challenges and opportunities that we face as a computing research community,” Zegura said.
As the organization continues to grow, it’s capabilities need to expand as well. This will be Zegura’s focus as chair.
“I welcome the chance to work with the board and CRA leadership on scaling CRA to a medium-sized operation while retaining the responsive capability to create and act on opportunities, especially in collaboration with the National Science Foundation and industry,” Zegura said.
Zegura is the Stephen Fleming Chair for Telecommunications and has been at the College of Computing since 1993, where she researches and teaches networking and computing for social good.
She is not the first GT Computing professor to shape the future of CRA. Founding Dean and Professor Emeritus Peter Freeman helped create the association, and Professor Emeritus Jim Foley also served as chair.
GT Computing has a strong presence on the CRA board. Executive Associate Dean Charles Isbell, School of Interactive Computing Chair Ayanna Howard, and Professor Vivek Sarkar, Zegura’s fellow Stephen Fleming Chair for Telecommunications, also currently serve on the CRA board.
Michael Best to Speak at U.N. for Release of Report on Digital Gender Equality
As many around the world celebrate International Women’s Day on Friday, March 8, a number of Georgia Tech faculty and students are making their own contributions to promoting women’s rights and gender equality. Among them is Georgia Tech Associate Professor Michael Best, who will speak at the United Nations next week during the formal release of a research report by the EQUALS Global Partnership, a coalition of more than 90 partners from government, industry, and academia that he helped found in 2015.
Best, who holds appointments in the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs and the School of Interactive Computing, will offer closing remarks on the report’s launch during the 63rd session of the Commission on the Status of Women, the principal global intergovernmental body dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women.
The report, titled Taking Stock: Data and Evidence on Gender Equality in Digital Access, Skills and Leadership, highlights the impacts of technology on women in various contexts like jobs and wages, security and privacy, cyber threats, and new technologies such as artificial intelligence.
Among the report’s results are a few key findings:
- While gender gaps are observable in most aspects of information and communications technology (ICT) access, skills, and leadership, the picture is still complex with large regional variations.
- There is no one final strategy for eliminating gender digital inequalities.
- The dominant approaches to gender equality in ICT access, skills and leadership mostly frame issues in binary (male/female) terms, thereby masking the relevance of other pertinent identities.
- To ensure privacy and safety as well as full participation in the digital economy, women and girls should have equal opportunities to develop adequate basic and advanced digital skills.
- Developments in digital technologies open new pathways to gender diversity and inclusion; however, lack of attention to gender dynamics hampers the potential for true progress.
“This report offers a comprehensive look at the issues affecting women and girls equality in a digital age,” Best said. “While surfacing many current challenges, it also sketches pathways forward towards achieving digital gender equality.”
Best joined Georgia Tech’s faculty in 2004 and has directed the United Nations University Institute on Computing and Society (UNU-CS) in China since 2015. He co-founded the EQUALS Global Partnership and the EQUALS Research Group, the latter of which is responsible for the report.
EQUALS works to reverse the increasing digital gender divide, aiming to close the gap by 2030 and supporting the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals by empowering women through their use of information and communication technologies.
“From its inception, the EQUALS Global Partnership has focused on evidence and data to illuminate the intersections of gender with ICTs,” Best said. “We have positioned the EQUALS Research Group at the forefront of this investigation, shining a light onto the realities and possibilities for women and girls in a digital age.”
The report will be released on March 15 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Georgia Tech Students Win Second in NSA Cybersecurity Competition
Georgia Tech students finished second in the National Security Administration’s (NSA) Codebreaker Challenge this January.
NSA designed the challenge for students to learn how to reverse engineer malware in a real-word setting. Running for 100 days from September to Jan. 6, each task increased in difficulty and points. Tech students earned 32,750 points, beating out 376 other universities for the second spot.
This wasn’t just a cybersecurity competition for fun, though. It was a course requirement for School of Computer Science (SCS) Assistant Professor Taesoo Kim’s Information Security Lab class.
To keep the things fair, students weren’t taught how to win Codebreaker, but they learned threat assessment at the binary code level and exploitation techniques to discover security vulnerabilities that helped them progress in the competition. Although most labs are graded by problems solved, teaching assistants monitored how many Codebreaker challenges each student completed.
“By watching their progress, I knew that they really understood what we were teaching and were ready for real-world challenges,” teaching assistant Insu Yun said.
Computer science master’s student Asutosh Palai joined the class for a chance to learn binary exploitation and enjoyed testing it out at the renowned competition. Even though he had some experience with binary reversing, or understanding how a compiled program works without the source code, he couldn’t have completed the final challenge on a new open source blockchain called Ethereum without the knowledge he learned in the lab.
“They taught us how to think critically about our code, and to find the loopholes in the assumptions made while writing them.”
Georgia Tech Researchers Are Bringing Better Networks to Native American Tribal Lands
Native Americans are one of the most under-connected populations in the U.S. But, thanks to a new multi-million dollar National Science Foundation (NSF) research grant, Georgia Tech researchers are looking to bring a different type of network to tribal lands to ensure everyone can be online.
With the new $2 million NSF grant, researchers will use LoRa — a long-range, low-power wireless network — to enable adaptive connectivity on tribal lands and offer the community technical training so it can maintain the network. The three-year project is part of NSF’s Smart and Connected Communities initiative.
School of Computer Science Professor Ellen Zegura is co-principal investigator along with University of California Santa Barbara Professor Elizabeth Belding, Arizona State University Professor Marisa Duarte, and Northern Arizona University Assistant Professor Morgan Vigil-Hayes.
The disconnect
While the rest of the country continues moving toward optical fiber and 5G connectivity in 2019, tribal lands can be a networking dead zone. Network research often operates under the assumption that a region has some pre-existing network, whether it’s an internet service provider or cellular data. Then researchers build a stronger network off of what is already available. Yet many tribal lands have no coverage because of difficult geography and low population density, creating little economic incentive for traditional providers to offer an affordable option.
“This lack of connectivity does exist in other parts of the U.S., but it’s especially acute in Native American lands,” Zegura said.
In 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a report stating that 1.2 million Native Americans don’t have mobile broadband connectivity. Worse yet, a later Government Accountability Office report countered saying the FCC overestimated their coverage. This is because the FCC considers an area to be broadband accessible even if just one house has connectivity.
This lack of network connectivity is detrimental to the health of Native American communities, who rely on the internet for online commerce, improving education, and tribal communications.
Networking researchers have been aware of the problem for years. Zegura and Belding have been working with collaborators on creating stronger networks for tribal lands since 2016 when NSF awarded $700,000 for a project called TribalNet that included Penn State, Georgia Tech, and UCSB. That project supported connectivity on Southern Californian tribal lands by expanding unused television broadcasting frequencies.
Creating a network
With the new NSF funding, the team will work to expand network access for Native American communities in Northern New Mexico. While the prior research focused on supporting downloadable content with underused networks, the new initiative emphasizes a network that can support new content creation and interaction where one doesn’t already exist.
The group is using LoRa to help create this network. Its long transmission range makes it low cost enough to cover an entire area, even if that area has no pre-existing network. Devices can start as low as $15 and need very little maintenance, making them ideal for low-income areas.
Yet the way the researchers are using LoRa is also novel. Traditionally networks operate with two planes over the same network infrastructure: the data plane and control plane. The data plane carries user traffic and is what enables information to be downloaded. The control plane carries signal traffic and routing information for networks. The researchers will be decoupling the two planes and using LoRa for control traffic to optimize use of traditional networks.
Working with a community
One of the other goals of the project is to ensure the community gets value from the work.
“There’s a long history of researchers doing research in communities but not leaving behind anything of long-lasting value,” Zegura said.
However, this project will be building networks on-site and offering technical training short courses for community members. They are also partnering with three area native-serving nonprofits that promote digital literacy.
“Native American lands are one of the last frontiers for connectivity, though it does seem like there are some interesting technologies that should help,” Zegura said. “This research is about using creativity and on-the-ground networks to figure out how to make a technological advance into a real-world advance.”

Alexandros Daglis Finds New Beginnings at the End of Moore’s Law
The number of computer chip transistors is no longer expected to double every year as Moore’s law declines. Most computer scientists see this as a problem, but new School of Computer Science Assistant Professor Alexandros Daglis thinks it’s an opportunity.
“There is a shifting balance of computing resources,” he said. “The advancements in raw computing power are tapering off, so networks have the time to catch up.”
The possibilities of hardware
Daglis has always been fascinated by what can make hardware faster. Although he got into computer science by programming video games as a teenager, he quickly discovered the appeal of hardware during his undergraduate years at the National Technical University of Athens.
“Caching and locality, they just felt so natural to me,” he said. “This is why computers work. The fundamental techniques that make computers so fast really piqued my interest.”
His undergraduate thesis was about how to improve caching. Yet during his Ph.D. at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EFPL), Daglis realized there were bigger problems to tackle.
Catching up with Moore
Under Moore’s law, central processing units (CPUs) became faster, whereas networks lagged. Yet as the paradigm shifts, networks can finally close the gap. According to Daglis, now is the time to lower latency, or data transfer speed, and increase bandwidth.
As a computer architect, Daglis wants to rethink the fundamentals of how communication-intensive systems, like social network applications running in datacenters, function. Users want to retrieve a small amount of data —a message, a friend request — fast. Yet, the existing network isn’t set up to make this run efficiently, according to Daglis.
“Fundamental latency bounds are catching up: we’re getting to speed-of-light data propagation within a datacenter’s internal network soon,” Daglis said. “But the way we build systems precludes leveraging the full potential of these faster networks. Network protocols are too slow for them, and the long-established interfaces our computing resources rely on to tap into the network are too slow as well.”
So Daglis wants to create a new paradigm: co-designing hardware and networks. As hardware needs to evolve and networks improve, it’s the perfect time to revisit system design.
“Networking’s legacy is blocking us from unleashing the true power of modern networks,” Daglis said.
Daglis believes moving higher-level operations closer to the CPU’s network endpoint is one effective way to better leverage growing network capabilities. For example, software predominantly handles decisions that balance incoming network messages across a server CPU’s many cores, but enabling the network endpoint to make these decisions can yield significant latency gains. This means transitioning from traditional CPU-centric computing to network- and memory-centric computing, which could have impacts across software, systems architecture, and algorithms.
For now, though, Daglis is taking a step back and focusing on how he can drastically improve the performance of communication-intensive systems. To do this, he plans to leverage relevant new technologies that are becoming commercially available, such as “smart” programmable network interface comtrllers and switches. Yet his goals are still ambitious.
“It’s interesting to explore the extent of immediate performance gains we can achieve by properly leveraging new commercial system components. However, it’s important to think about what we can do in the longer term that is not just incremental, but fundamentally different from existing computing systems by using pieces of increasingly heterogeneous hardware resources used for computation and networking,” he said. “My vision of co-designing the two will enable a much broader portfolio of functionality.”
Joseph Anz Goes from Mars to OMSCS
Joseph Anz is no stranger to balancing multiple projects. The Online Master’s of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) student was only 16 when he started working at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
Computing was a natural fit for Anz, who once hacked his TI-84 graphing calculator to solve high school calculus problems. His teachers took note, challenging him to create programs for his homework. They also encouraged him to take college-level computer science (CS) courses in his sophomore year. By that summer, he was interning at NASA.
As it happened, Anz’s internship coincided with NASA’s development of the Mars Rover Curiosity. As part of the team responsible for publicly promoting Curiosity, Anz created websites and wrote articles on the rover. His contributions were acknowledged when NASA etched his name on one of the rover’s microchips.
“It was extraordinary to be part of Curiosity’s development, and to watch it launch and successfully land,” he said. “That’s one of the reasons why I’m still at NASA. To be super young and get to partake in big historical milestones at my workplace has really given me a sense of community and belonging.”
Eight years later, Anz is an enterprise applications software engineer in the JPL, where he develops in-house products for the lab’s 6,000-plus engineers and scientists. His projects have included everything from cost-estimation tools to creating a modeling environment for spacecraft construction.
Finding OMSCS
Now, he’s set to achieve another big accomplishment: getting an OMSCS degree in interactive intelligence in just 18 months.
Anz always knew he wanted to get a graduate degree to complement his undergraduate education in CS and engineering at the University of California, San Diego. Yet, he didn’t want to lose the community and work he had at the lab. Fortunately, OMSCS offered Anz the chance to do both.
[RELATED: OMSCS: Five Years a Cyber Pioneer]
“When I get home, I don’t want to just spend my time on Netflix,” he said. “I want to try and jump-start my career and actually study and grow.”
Anz is one of many OMSCS students currently working at JPL. His former supervisor, in fact, introduced him to the program. Having a real-world community to get advice on which classes to take or homework help was one of the main reasons Anz chose Georgia Tech’s program.
Succeeding in OMSCS
Still, Anz credits his self-discipline for his ability to power through two courses a semester, a rate that is much faster than most students’. He usually works weeknights from 10 p.m. to midnight or catches up on Saturdays. He admits it’s not easy, but he likes the challenge.
“The key for me is time management and setting deadlines,” he said. “I am very disciplined and self-driven, and that’s the requirement for being successful in an online program because you don’t have people watching you.”
All the late hours add up, though. Anz has been able to apply his classes directly to his career and see the impact. In particular, he credits OMSCS Associate Director of Student Experience David Joyner’s emphasis on conducting user research to drive application requirements and design.
[RELATED: Careers, Grad School, Kids: One Family’s Story of How They Make OMSCS Work]
“OMSCS really helps in my career because I am developing applications for different audiences, like scientist and engineers,” he said. “Having classes that touch on topics like health informatics and machine learning for stock trading helps me engage with different audiences.”
When Anz isn’t working or studying, he practices barista skills and listens to music. Ultimately, he hopes what he learns through OMSCS can help him bridge his passions for creativity and computing.
“My emphasis has always been making people happy and fostering interaction with my audience - that’s what brings me joy,” he said. “I want to develop meaningful and cool applications for the users.”
Six Members of GT Computing Awarded Prestigious Fellowships
Each year, Georgia Tech’s College of Computing is home to a number of students and faculty who are recognized by the computing community with fellowships from industry across the field.
This year is no different as six GT Computing individuals have been awarded fellowships with four different companies, including J.P. Morgan, IBM, Snap, and Facebook. Only those who accepted their awards are listed below.
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. awarded Charles David Byrd (Research Scientist and Ph.D. student advised by Professor Tucker Balch) and Assistant Professor Xu Chu for efforts in artificial intelligence research. It is the company’s first AI Research Awards, which are aimed at studying the use of AI and machine learning in areas including investment advice, risk management, digital assistants, and trading behavior. Only 47 fellowships were awarded by the company.
Byrd’s work, along with Balch, is focused on machine learning for financial applications, investigating mutual fund portfolio inference, intraday equity market forecasting, stock market simulation, and machine learning approaches to the evaluation of market efficiency. Byrd has been recognized in the past as the 2018 Graduate Student Instructor of the Year Award in the School of Interactive Computing.
Chu’s research interests revolve around two themes: using data management technologies to make machine learning more usable and using machine learning to tackle hard data management problems like data integration. Chu also earned the Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellowship in 2015.
IBM
Ph.D. student Stacey Truex of the School of Computer Science was named a 2019 IBM Ph.D. Fellow. The Fellowship, which has been around since the 1950s, recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students who are focused on solving problems that are fundamental to innovation. This includes pioneering work in areas like cognitive computing and augmented intelligence, quantum computing, blockchain, data-centric systems, advanced analytics, security, radical cloud innovation, and more. This highly-competitive award was given to only 16 Ph.D. students worldwide.
Truex (advised by Professor Ling Liu) focuses on research from two complementary perspectives: 1) privacy, security, and trust in machine learning models and algorithmic decision making, and 2) secure, privacy-preserving artificial intelligence systems, services, and applications.
Snap, Inc.
Snap, Inc., recognized Ph.D. student Harsh Agrawal of the School of Interactive Computing with the 2019 Snap Research Fellowship and Scholarship. This fellowship recognizes students carrying out research in areas of computer science relevant to the company, including computer graphics, computer vision, machine learning, data mining, computational imaging, human-computer interaction, and other related fields. Each awardee will receive a $10,000 award and an offer for a full-time paid internship with the company.
Agrawal (advised by Assistant Professor Dhruv Batra) does research at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, he spent time as a research engineer at Snap Research, where he was responsible for building large-scale infrastructure for visual recognition, search and developed algorithms for low-shot instance detection.
Facebook Research announced the selection of 21 Fellows and seven Emerging Scholars this year out of more than 900 submitted applications from Ph.D. students all over the world.

His research has been supported by fellowships from Facebook, Adobe, and Snap, Inc., over the years. Oguamanam, who is in the School of Interactive Computing, pursues research in educational technology, human-computer interaction for development, diversity in STEM, and entrepreneurship. She is co-advised by Associate Professor Betsy DiSalvo and Assistant Professor Neha Kumar.
College of Computing Leads Team Awarded $6.25 Million to Study Collective Emergent Behavior
Georgia Tech researchers have been awarded $6.25 million from the Department of Defense (DoD) to use collective emergent behavior to achieve task-oriented objectives.
DoD’s Multidisciplinary University Research Initiatives (MURI) Program funds projects that bring researchers together from diverse backgrounds to work on a complex problem. Institute for Data Engineering and Science co-director and School of Computer Science Professor Dana Randall is the project investigator and leads a team of six that includes Daniel Goldman, Dunn Family Professor in the School of Physics. The Formal Foundations of Algorithmic Matter and Emergent Computation team also includes chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, physics, and computational science researchers from other universities.
The researchers are trying to predict and design emergent behavior within computation by using basic algorithms on simple machines to perform complex tasks. Emergent behavior is when a microscopic change in a parameter creates a macroscopic change to a system. This collective behavior is easy to find in nature, from a swarm of bees to a colony of ants, but also appears in other scientific disciplines.
“A MURI lets us take a deep dive toward understanding how many computationally limited components at the micro-scale can be programmed to work collectively to produce useful behavior at the macro-scale,” said Randall, who is also the ADVANCE Professor of Computing. “Our interdisciplinary team combines expertise in many fields, mimicking the research by forming a collaboration that is also greater than the sum of its parts."
The MURI hybrid approach to algorithmic matter combines traditional logic-based programming with non-traditional computational methods, such as using physical characteristics of the interacting matter to drive a system toward collective behavior. One of the goals is to program based on this predictable emergent behavior. The approach also predicts basic properties of the collective’s emergent behavior, like whether it will behave like a gas, fluid, or solid. In this context, emergent behavior turns into emergent collective computation.
“MURI promises basic algorithms that allow very simple machines to work collectively to perform amazingly complex tasks,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) chemical engineering Professor Michael Strano said. “Our team will examine systems of autonomous cell-like particles that interact and respond to the movement of their neighbors in a programmable way. Theorists will be able to test ideas of emergent computation from these simple devices and learn how to execute tasks from the behavior of relatively simple, autonomous particles.”
Although the behavior has footing in physics, computer science, and swarm robotics, there is no underlying framework to explain why until this research. The multidisciplinary approach allows theory and experiment to continuously inform each other and determine the computational capabilities of emergent behavior. The team has an ideal range of expertise in machine learning, control theory, and non-equilibrium physics and algorithms. They are also working with experimentalists who build collective systems at granular and microscopic scales.
“An exciting aspect of this collaboration will be our attempts to interface and integrate ideas and tools from robotics, non-equilibrium physics, control theory, and computer science to develop task-capable swarms,” Goldman said.
This MURI project will run for five years and is funded by the Army Research Office. In addition to Randall, Goldman, and Strano, the team also includes Arizona State computational science and engineering Professor Andrea Richa, MIT physics Associate Professor Jeremy England, and Northwestern mechanical engineering Professor Todd Murphey.
The overarching goal is to find how simplistic the computation can be for this complexity. This could lead to advances in engineered systems achieving specific task-oriented goals.
“The MURI promises nothing short of the transformation of robots,” Strano said, “from the large, bulky constructions that we think of today, to future clouds or swarms that enable functions that are currently impossible to realize.”
Student Puts OMSCS Knowledge to Use Creating Mind-Controllable Robotic Hand
Glenn Cameron stands in his office wearing a brain-computer interface on his head and holding a 3-D printed robotic hand. He thinks about picking up a spoon, and the hand slowly grasps the handle.
This simple touch has been years in the making, but what started as a fun hobby on vacation has now led Cameron to pursuing an Online Master's of Computer Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) degree and to aspirations of creating his own bionics company.
Finding bionics
His interest in robotics began in 2015, when he stopped by a Radio Shack on vacation and bought a robotic car kit. As a self-taught coder, Cameron discovered with a few modifications he could make the car semi-autonomous. Soon, Cameron had a car that could drive itself around his San Francisco apartment without bumping into things.
The experience made Cameron realize how basic hardware could be used to build complex semi-autonomous systems. He didn’t just want to make fun toys, though; he wanted to create things people could actually use.
Bionics were a natural fit for Cameron because he’s been wanting to help people with disabilities his whole life. In elementary school, Cameron had a friend who was born without a right hand.
“There were simple things like riding a bike that were more difficult for him than for me,” Cameron said. “I wanted to challenge myself to do something difficult and stretch my limits to make an advanced prosthetic robotic hand to help people like him.”
When he found an open source robotic hand on the internet, Cameron 3-D printed it and got started. But he learned there were many limitations to the basic software. Although he could program the hand to open and close, it couldn’t tell where its fingers were. Cameron knew he didn’t have the expertise to make it more agile, but he knew where he could find it.
“I couldn’t do complex programming, and that’s one of the reasons I enrolled in OMSCS in 2017 because I just wanted to get better,” he said.
Bridging the gap with OMSCS
Cameron focuses on interactive intelligence in the program, where he’s taken classes on computer vision and basic programming. The mix allows Cameron to build up his technical skills while also understanding how to design a product people can really use.
“Human computer interaction courses have helped me to think about how this hand would work on a real amputee,” he said.
The first two iterations of the hand used electrical motors in the base, which isn’t an ideal setup for an amputee, as Cameron learned in his classes. The third version now has streamlined motorized bases that fit easily on to an amputee’s arm.
Improving the hand
This is just one of many evolutions since the first hand he printed off the internet. Cameron has trained a standard brain-computer interface to recognize what he’s thinking and turn it into a task. The hand is better able to complete the task because it now has fingers with knuckles that can move and adapt to the shape of an object it's holding while sensing the tightness of its grip and where its fingers have moved. The next version will feature more sensors so the hand can feel what’s in its fingertips.
Each design has been self-funded with around $1,000 in parts and a small team helping Cameron code and test. The limited resources have forced him to be creative and have made the hand more accessible than other companies like NASA, whose Robonaut 2 hand cost $2.5 million to make.
Cameron has been entering his robotic hand in contests as a way of getting feedback for the project and recently won Georgia Tech’s Career, Research, and Innovation Development Conference’s online poster contest with the second version. With this feedback, he hopes to formalize his research by publishing papers.
His ultimate goal is to combine his background in software marketing with his OMSCS degree to run a bionics company or lead a team for another company.
“It’s kind of like a calling,” he said. “I enjoy working toward something good like this.”
Research Reveals Possibly Fatal Consequences of Algorithmic Bias
Self-driving cars are supposed to make driving safer, but they may endanger the lives of certain groups. New Georgia Tech research suggests that pedestrians with darker skin may be more likely to get hit by self-driving cars than those with lighter skin.
The researchers tested machine learning (ML) object detection models to see how well they could see people with different skin tones. Their results revealed models were nearly 5 percent less likely to detect darker-skinned pedestrians.
This predictive imbalance remained regardless of how researchers accounted for variables in the training data set, such as time of day, partially blocked views of pedestrians, and pixel size of the person.
“Companies don’t want the public to know about any issues of inaccuracy, so consumers need to learn to ask a lot of questions,” said Jamie Morgenstern, School of Computer Science (SCS) assistant professor and the study’s lead author.
Biased data
The prediction system is only one possible source of the inequity. The training data is another. The researchers used one of the most comprehensive publicly available self-driving car training datasets and wanted to determine if it represented all skin tones evenly. They classified the images using Fitzpatrick skin typing, a scale to predict UV sensitivity, and found the dataset has roughly 3.5 times as many examples of people with lighter skin.
This discrepancy might introduce problems because of the ML method known as loss function, which determines how well an algorithm can model a dataset. A model learns by measuring loss function between predicted values and actual values. The goal is to get as small of a loss function output as possible, indicating the model fits the data well. This approach is more accurate with larger subsets in the data, but can minimize the value of smaller groups. In effect, this 3.5 difference made the results even more accurate for lighter-skinned pedestrians.
Despite the bias, Morgenstern remains optimistic. The team was able to correct for the inequity by reweighing the model to better analyze smaller groups.
The findings, published earlier this month, have attracted media coverage and some criticism. Much of this stems from the fact that Morgenstern and her fellow researchers – School of Interactive Computing Assistant Professor Judy Hoffman and machine learning Ph.D. student Benjamin Wilson — were not able to investigate ML models and training data actually used by the self-driving car industry because they are not publicly available.
[RELATED: Georgia Tech Researchers Improve Fairness in the Machine Learning Pipeline]
A bigger problem
This is not the first study of ML systems having varying predictive accuracy on different demographics. Other researchers have found examples in the financial sector. Yet in many of these scenarios, developers won’t take responsibility, according to Morgenstern.
“Developers blame any biased outcomes of their system on biased historical trends, such as the fact that more loans were applied for and issued in whiter neighborhoods, or biased training data,” she said. “For example, if the training labels used for creditworthiness instead reflect only the decisions of lenders who are now known to have had higher predictive accuracy on white applicants.”
With self-driving cars, however, a system developer would have a harder time blaming object detection system bias on historical trends or behavior of certain demographic groups. This was what appealed to Morgenstern about this research.
“There is no capacity for arguing that historical behavior of some group should affect the trade-offs made by self-driving cars,” Morgenstern said. “No one deserves to be hit by a car.”
OMSCS Student Creates History of AI Exhibition at Ferst Center for the Arts
In 1898, engineer Nikola Tesla designed a remote-controlled boat and immediately saw its implications for artificial intelligence.
“Time is not distant when I shall show an automaton, which left to itself, will act as though possessed of reason and without any willful control from the outside,” he wrote.
A sketch of this boat is on display at Georgia Tech’s Ferst Center for the Arts as part of a new exhibition History of AI, curated by Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) student Edwardo Martinez. The 18 pieces chronicle the progress of artificial intelligence (AI) from 1770 through today. Martinez pairs actual advancements in AI, like Tesla’s boat, with pop culture’s understanding of it, including Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Mickey Mouse comics, and HBO drama West World.
“AI is starting to impact a lot of individuals' lives, so using art as the medium and choosing commonplace science fiction tropes is a good way to draw people into the exhibition,” Martinez said.
Ultimately, he hopes the exhibition illustrates how AI hasn’t always been seen as a problem but a possibility.
“A lot of what we hear about AI can highlight negative outcomes, with the extreme case of humanity being destroyed, but people like Tesla saw it as the future in a very matter-of-fact way.”
Finding motivation through OMSCS
Martinez, who works as a software engineer, has always been interested in AI and used his OMSCS studies to develop that passion. In one of his first classes, he thought it would be fun to create a timeline of the field, but the idea didn’t become a reality until his final semester when he took OMSCS Associate Director of Student Experience David Joyner’s Educational Technology course, which teaches students how to put together educational research projects.
“It helps students figure out an intended audience, what research should be done, choose a delivery structure, and develop a plan to get a project done,” Martinez said. “It was a really good way of forcing myself to do research on something I thought was interesting.”
Using Google Scholar, Martinez was able to find a narrative of AI’s evolution, but he needed to find a way to present it compellingly because one of his goals was to make the research accessible to people who didn’t work in computing. Soon, he realized art would be the most approachable medium.
Around the same time, Martinez heard of the Ferst Center’s Creative Curricular Initiatives grant program and applied. With a match from the College of Computing, Martinez won the grant and used it to laser cut and 3-D print different pieces for the exhibition at maker-spaces near where he lives in San Francisco.
Perhaps his most ambitious yet is “Theseus.” It’s a piece that combines neon-yellow florescent acrylic and 3-D printing to tell the story of Claude Shannon’s intelligent mouse that could solve a maze on its own.
The exhibition will be on display in the lobby of the Ferst Center until April 25, but Martinez hopes to expand and send the exhibition to other AI research centers. In the meantime, the entire exhibition can be viewed on its website with detailed descriptions of Martinez’s artistic process.
Professor Recognized for Distinguished Record of Leadership in Establishing a School at Georgia Tech
Regent’s Professor and Founding Chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Richard Fujimoto is this year’s recipient of the Class of 1934 Outstanding Interdisciplinary Activities Award.
According to the Georgia Tech Faculty Honors Committee, Fujimoto is being recognized for his distinguished record of leadership in establishing CSE as a school, along with several of its ancillary student programs.
“Georgia Tech has a different view of computational science and engineering than other universities,” said Fujimoto.
“We view CSE as a discipline in its own right, focusing on knowledge at the intersection of computing, mathematics, and science and engineering applications, and have created a department focused on this area. Few other universities have such a department.”
According to Fujimoto, there are distinct advantages to CSE’s designation as a formal department. “In particular, it allows us to hire faculty strategically in important areas. And, there is evidence that other universities are beginning to emulate this approach,” he said.
Building a school from the ground up
Fujimoto came to Georgia Tech as a faculty member shortly before the creation of the College of Computing in 1990. During those initial years, the College’s leadership was navigating issues of scale and change.
“In the early years we had the College of Computing, but in many ways, it looked a lot like a big computer science department. There was tremendous growth in the 1990’s which created many challenges related to scaling our activities,” he said.
Rich DeMillo was hired as dean in 2002 and scalability was one of the issues he aimed to address. His first step was to split the college into two parts: the Division of Computer Science (to become the School of Computer Science in 2007) and the Division of Interactive Computing (to become the School of Interactive Computing in 2007).
Then, in 2005, DeMillo began an initiative in the College focused on high-performance computing. This eventually led to the formation of the CSE school.
“He wanted to take a broader look at the intersection of computation with science and engineering, and that’s really what formed the beginnings of the school. So, in 2005, Rich asked me to serve as chair and founder of this new division, which would officially become the School of Computational Science and Engineering in 2010,” said Fujimoto. “We broadened the initiative to extend beyond high-performance computing to encompass other areas such as data analytics and modeling and simulation. These formed the foundation for the CSE school.”
“When getting started in 2005, all of the faculty in CSE had to be hired, which was very different from the other schools, which were composed of existing faculty. The initial faculty were me and two new faculty, [current CSE Chair] David Bader, and [CSE Professor] Haesun Park. And, we were more or less tasked with figuring things out from there.”
Fujimoto served as CSE chair from 2005 to 2014. During this time, he, Park, and Bader worked together with faculty across campus to establish CSE’s graduate programs and curriculum including:
- The interdisciplinary CSE M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs
- The CSE thread of Georgia Tech’s undergraduate computer science program
- and two undergraduate minor programs
This group also led in creating the Computing Research Undergraduate Intern Summer Experience (CRUISE) program as well as the College’s first online degree program with the online MS program in CSE. Fujimoto later co-led the development of Georgia Tech’s MS in Analytics with faculty from the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering and the Scheller College of Business.
Life after building CSE
Since he ended his role as chair in 2014, Fujimoto says he has spent his time focusing on his research.
“I took a detour from my research activities to start the school. Now, I am focusing on my own core research program in parallel and distributed simulation,” he said.
“My current research is looking at energy issues in distributed simulation. It’s an area that is well studied in embedded systems and mobile systems, but has not been heavily studied in the modeling and simulation community. My mission for the past few years has been to get more people in the modeling and simulation community to engage in this area, which is really important work.”
Fujimoto currently has many active collaborations across Georgia Tech. He has several projects focused on sustainability with the Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems, research in distributed simulation and transportation systems management with Civil and Environmental Engineering, and materials research and education through the NSF-funded FLAMEL Program.
Two New NVIDIA Collaborations Awarded to Georgia Tech with School of CSE’s Leadership
Georgia Tech is now the recipient of a NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab (NVAIL) grant as part of the NVAIL program focusing on graph analytics on graphics processing units (GPUs).
Additionally, Georgia Tech, along with with Texas A&M, and U.C. Davis, will all contribute to the progress of the NVIDIA data science curriculum partnership this year, expanding the open source RAPIDS graph analytics algorithms.
Through these partnerships, Georgia Tech will work closely with NVIDIA researchers on GPU technologies and their application to data analytics. The goal of this collaboration is to build the world’s most advanced accelerated end-to-end pipeline for data analytics, and to support groundbreaking work of the world’s leading AI researchers and labs.
School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Chair David Bader led the NVAIL program proposal effort as part of continuing work at Georgia Tech on GPU technology and scalable graph algorithms.
“Data science is the fastest growing field of computer science today. With this growth in mind, we are excited to further the collaborative relationship of Georgia Tech and NVIDIA,” said Bader. “We will focus on the design and implementation of scalable graph algorithms and primitives for integrating into cuGRAPH, leveraging the Hornet framework that will foster new abilities in the broader community of data scientists.”
As part of the awards, NVIDIA is providing:
- $100,000 cash award for one year toward research into scalable graph algorithms
- (1) NVIDIA DGX Station
- Collaboration on Deep Learning Institute Teaching Kits and educator outreach
- Opportunities for faculty and students of the Georgia Tech NVIDIA AI Lab to work at NVIDIA as visiting professors and interns
College of Computing Student Alex Cabrera Wins Love Family Foundation Scholarship
College of Computing student Ángel (Alex) Cabrera has won the Love Family Foundation Scholarship. The annual award recognizes an undergraduate with outstanding scholastic record and is the highest honor Georgia Tech can give to a graduating student.
This year associate and assistant deans from the six colleges awarded the $10,000 scholarship from the Gay and Erksine Love Foundation to both Cabrera and Scheller College of Business student Meredith Wolpert. Cabrera is a Stamps President’s Scholar and has been a campus leader, dedicated student, and ambitious researcher with an eye for practical problems.
Cabrera — who was also recently awarded the 2019 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship — has pursued challenging projects since he started as a computer science student in 2015. In his first years, he led the software team for the PROX-1 satellite, a student project scheduled to launch on the SpaceX Falcon Heavy. He also worked as a campus tour guide and organized the 2017 Stamps Scholars National Convention.
Cabrera also pursued his interest in computer science outside of the classroom by interning at Google the past three summers. The internships gave him the opportunity to work on difficult real-world problems, such as building an analytics dashboard to monitor errors in Google Maps, designing an anomaly detection system for Google’s data processing pipelines, and working on new car features for the next generation of Android Auto.
“I really enjoyed working on this huge data system that improves the map millions of people use every day,” he said.
While Cabrera liked his software engineering internships, he was most passionate about the research portion of the work. He decided to pursue research directly during his junior year, when he became one of the few undergraduates in the Polo Club of Data Science, a research group run by School of Computational Science and Engineering Associate Professor Polo Chau.
“I was immediately impressed by the leadership and academic achievements he had already accomplished,” Chau said. “I recruited him to join my research group right away.”
Cabrera’s first project with the lab was working to help people better understand deep learning models for image classification. He and his co-authors presented their work, Interactive Classification for Deep Learning Interpretation, as a demo at the premier computer vision conference, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2018.
The research group also introduced Cabrera to one of the biggest challenges machine learning (ML) faces: equity and fairness. With Chau and School of Computer Science Assistant Professor Jamie Morgenstern, Cabrera is working on techniques to aid users in discovering algorithmic bias, a problem in which ML models encode or enforce societal biases by treating different demographic groups disparately.
Using Morgenstern’s knowledge of theory and Chau’s interactive visualization expertise, the group created an algorithm and visual interface to help developers audit ML models for intersectional bias. The research has been accepted to the Debugging Machine Learning Models workshop at the upcoming Seventh International Conference on Learning Representations in May.
“ML models are marketed as being more fair and just, but in reality, they are often trained on biased data, and models can even worsen existing biases,” Cabrera said. “My goal is to create usable tools for fairness that can help developers discover these issues”
Throughout his internships and projects, Cabrera has maintained a 4.0 GPA and worked as a teaching assistant for CS1332 - Data Structures and Algorithms during three semesters.
“Alex does an amazing job as a TA. He has exceptional knowledge of the course content and programming in Java,” said Mary Hudachek-Buswell, College of Computing lecturer and Cabrera’s supervisor. “He’s highly regarded by all and is a wonderful mentor to many of the students.”
He will continue his research this fall as an incoming Ph.D. student in the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.
Understanding How Data Scientists Understand Machine Learning Models
How do data scientists read and understand machine learning model outputs? This is the question that a new design probe built by a team of researchers led by School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Ph.D. student Fred Hohman aims to answer.
“Without good models and the right tools to interpret them, data scientists risk making decisions based on hidden biases, spurious correlations, and false generalizations. This has led to a rallying cry for model interpretability,” said Hohman.
To address this issue, Hohman teamed up with U.C. Berkeley Ph.D. candidate Andrew Head and Microsoft researchers Rich Caruana, Robert DeLine, and Steven Drucker, to create Gamut. Gamut is an interactive system designed to investigate how data scientists interpret models, and how interactive interfaces can support data scientists in answering questions about model interpretability.
“Machine learning is doing all this amazing work nowadays like cancer prediction, predicting fire risks in buildings, and poverty prediction via satellite images. But there are many applications where demographic bias such as gender, age, or race, is learned from data,” continued Hohman.
“That brings us to Gamut, which focuses on an area of machine learning called interpretability, which is essentially trying to understand what a machine learning algorithm has actually learned so data scientists can trust its predictions.”
The system uses generalized additive models (GAMs), that combine high accuracy with an inherently intelligible structure, and interactive data visualization, to display model results and predictions to ultimately study how data scientists use explainable interfaces for interpretability.
Surprisingly, while the term interpretability loosely describes a human understanding of some component of a model, no formal agreed upon definition has been reached about what component should be understood, according to Hohman. This is another reason why Gamut is a critical piece to solving the interpretability puzzle.
Rather than aiming to define interpretability, Hohman says Gamut instead aims to operationalize it, or turn the fuzzy concept of interpretability into something more easily usable and actionable.
“Since machine learning models are still being used despite their problems, the idea is that we can break interpretability down into a suite of techniques to help data scientists interpret models today. And, by collaborating with Microsoft, our human-centered approach using rich user interaction and data visualization can be informed and tested by professional data scientists who work with machine learning daily.
“Our investigation showed that interpretability is not a monolithic concept. Data scientists have different reasons to interpret models and tailor explanations for specific audiences, often balancing competing concerns of simplicity and completeness,” Hohman said.
South Big Data Hub Recognized for Expanding Georgia Tech Research Portfolio and Platform
Georgia Tech’s Office of the Executive Vice President for Research (EVPR) awarded the South Big Data Regional Innovation Hub (SBDH) the Outstanding Achievement in Research Program Development Award for 2019. The annual award is presented to a research team for efforts that create a new thought leadership platform that significantly expands Georgia Tech’s research portfolio.
“We were proud to honor the leadership of the South Big Data Regional Hub this year,” said Chaouki T. Abdallah, Georgia Tech’s executive vice president for Research. “The SBDH provides national visibility for Georgia Tech as a thought leader in big data and further positions the Institute as a regional center of excellence.”
The Georgia Tech team members recognized for their leadership in this program include:
-
Srinivas Aluru, professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and co-executive director of the Institute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS);
-
Renata Rawlings-Goss, executive director of the South Big Data Hub;
-
Ashok Goel, professor in the School of Interactive Computing; and
-
Gari Clifford, adjunct professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering.
"It is extremely gratifying to launch the South Big Data Hub and nurture it to grow into a national asset,” said Aluru, primary investigator of SBDH. “The Hub community is broad, undertaking regionally and nationally important challenges in diverse areas including health disparities, environmental sustainability, energy infrastructure, coastal hazard management, and data science education and workforce training.”
The SBDH was launched in 2015 as part of the National Science Foundation’s Big Data Research and Development Initiative. The SBDH is jointly coordinated with the University of North Carolina and includes broad membership from academia, industry, government, and nonprofit organizations across 16 southern states and Washington, D.C.
The award was presented to the SBDH leadership team at the Institute Faculty and Staff Honors Luncheon last week, shortly after the South Big Data Regional Innovation Hub hosted the annual All-hands Meeting.

Research on Reddit ID’s Opioid Addiction Self-Treatment Risks
Using advanced machine-learning techniques, Georgia Tech researchers have examined nearly 1.5 million Reddit posts to identify risks associated with several of the most common alternative treatments for opioid addiction.
These clinically untested, self-directed treatments are often developed and promoted through online communities like Reddit, which commonly encourage their use without professional medical consultation. According to the study, the three most commonly used are:
- Kratom – an unregulated herbal stimulant
- Imodium – a common anti-diarrheal medication
- Xanax – a psychiatric medication used to treat anxiety and panic disorders
The findings – part of what the researchers say is one of the first large-scale social media study of clinically unproven, alternative treatments (ATs) used in opioid addiction recovery – indicate that these treatments offer:
- Risky results
- Potentially substantial side effects
- High chance of abuse for those struggling with recovery
“Along with identifying what potentially are the most commonly used alternative treatments, we documented a number of important trends and gained valuable insights into how people use ATs, which will be used in part to better inform current treatment strategies,” said Stevie Chancellor, Georgia Tech College of Computing Ph.D. student and chief author of the study.
[PODCAST: Social Media's Role in Opioid Addiction Recovery with Stevie Chancellor]
One of the key trends documented among AT users is the growing use of “stacks” or “kits.” These combine several substances – prescription drugs, illicit drugs, over the counter medications, vitamins/minerals, or other substances – to combat withdrawal symptoms and facilitate recovery.
An anonymous Reddit post evaluated in the study read, “I’ve decided to quit [opioids] for good - what you guys think about my withdrawal strategy?” The post goes on to list what can reasonably be considered as a risky mix of anti-anxiety drugs, OTCs, alcohol, and more. Added to this, the study also found that many of these “stacks” have specific dosing patterns that users follow.
To identify these posts from among the initial dataset of 1.44 million posts from 63 subreddits, Chancellor and her colleagues developed a machine learning binary classifier. The classifier, which used a transfer learning approach to improve results as it scanned from one subreddit to the next, automatically labeled each post as either recovery or non-recovery related.
[RELATED: Researchers Plumb Reddit to Reveal New Insights into Stress Following Campus Violence]
The research team – which included an addiction research scientist – applied natural language processing techniques to the resulting dataset of 93,104 recovery-related posts. Known as “word embeddings,” the process allows a system to find and learn contextual relationships between words and phrases in a large dataset. These relationships often reveal connections between words that may be misspelled or slang terms for common words.
The results were verified through a series of automated and human-in-the-loop validation tests of the machine learning algorithm.
“We found that Imodium, commonly used to relieve nausea and diarrhea, is often referred to as ‘lope’, which is short for the active ingredient Loperamide. We also confirm that it is prone to misuse and dependence,” said Chancellor.
It’s this kind of insight the Georgia Tech team wants to share with treatment and recovery researchers and care providers.
“Because there is little empirical research into alternative treatments for opioid use disorder, professionals overseeing detoxification and behavioral interventions are at a disadvantage,” said Munmun De Choudhury, School of Interactive Computing assistant professor and co-author of the research study.
“Broadly speaking, we’re interested in reducing the harm that can be caused by alternative treatments. We are moving in the right direction by identifying and giving some context to the most commonly used of these, which ultimately gives behavioral health clinicians more insight into how ATs impact their patients.”
Chancellor and De Choudhury’s work on this project was supported in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, #R01GM112697.
Complete details about the study are in a paper Discovering Alternative Treatments for Opioid Use Recovery Using Social Media, which has been accepted to the 2019 ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, set for May 4 through 9 in Glasgow, UK.
IC's Miranda Parker Uncovering Factors that Lead to CS Programs in Georgia
Miranda Parker was early on in her time as a Ph.D. student in the School of Interactive Computing (IC) when she began her first quantitative study. She wanted to see whether they could model the variables that influence whether a school would or would not adopt computer science (CS) as a class for its students.
Prior to the study, the hypothesis was that variables like median income or enrollment numbers or the population of students who qualify for free and reduced cost lunch programs could be an indicator of whether or not computer science was implemented. Lower income levels, for example, might correlate to schools that just didn’t have the resources to deploy such programs.
Somewhat to Parker’s surprise, the short answer to that question was – no. No, a higher median income didn’t mean more computer science; no, schools with lower free and reduced lunch numbers didn’t teach computer science at a higher rate; no, higher enrollment didn’t necessarily mean more young students yearning to learn how to code.
On the surface, that first study might have felt like a failure. If the goal was to prove that income disparity equated to a disparity in who was gaining exposure to a key part of their education, then it may be fair to describe it as such. However, Parker looks back on that study as a key component of what has guided her research at Georgia Tech ever since.
It wasn’t a failure, she said. It just helped open her eyes to some realities she may not have noticed otherwise.
“Part of me wanted my first study to fail because part of me didn’t want to be able to say, ‘Oh, yes, these three things mean more computer science,’” she said. “Sure, it’s snazzy. It’s easy to put on a Facebook post. But it’s so much more complicated than that. And I’m glad that it’s more complicated than that.”
Over the years, Parker, who studies human-centered computing with a focus on computer science education, has gained a deeper understanding of what might influence a public high school in Georgia to offer computer science education. None of the above items are among them. What she said has shown some correlation is a bit more complex.
“If a school had computer science in 2016, the correlation was that it also had computer science in 2015, 2014, and 2013,” she said.
Okay, but how did it get started in 2013? That’s part of the question her research is trying to uncover.
“That’s an endless cycle,” she explained. “You had it before, now you still have it. But how did you get it to begin with?”
One thing she’s learned, which can be said for a majority of research in IC, is that it comes down to the people. Who is involved with a school and what connections do they have to a particular subject? If a connection has worked in CS in the past or may be passionate about adding that to the school, the results indicate the school is much more likely to employ that subject.
Makes sense, right?
“If a school has someone who can teach computer science and there are parents saying we need to teach computer science, then whether it’s rural or urban or high or low income, it doesn’t matter,” Parker said. “They will have computer science. But if there’s no one there to push them, it’s much less likely.”
It’s not just a person, either. Organizations like Georgia Tech’s Constellations Center for Equity in Computing and the Center for Education Integrating Science, Math, and Computing are also championing K-12 CS educational opportunities.
But, Parker said, being successful is a bit more complicated than just serving CS up to the masses in communities that are unfamiliar with these and other organizations.
“Computer science isn’t the end all, be all,” she said. “If a school is in a more agricultural-based county, that may benefit the school more than a heavy computer science program would. It’s about finding how computer science can most benefit students in different ways for different areas.”
The most encouraging thing about that research, Parker said, was that the failure of her original study showed her one important piece of information.
“You don’t need high income to have computer science,” she said. “It really can be for everyone. That’s an important piece of information to know.”
Parker is aiming to finish her Ph.D. work in the fall and will decide between pursuing a faculty position, which she is leaning toward now, or other opportunities that may present themselves down the road. Former Georgia Tech Professor Mark Guzdial, now a faculty member at the University of Michigan, is Parker’s advisor.
Georgia Tech's Child Study Lab Sees Computer Science as New 'Microscope' for Autism Research
What if behavior could be mapped and analyzed in much the same way an MRI provides images of the brain or a microscope an up-close look at cells? Both proved to be paradigm shifts in detecting developmental anomalies or diseases like cancer, and Georgia Tech research at the intersection of computing and early childhood behavior could do the same for autism.
Building upon nearly a decade of research, Georgia Tech’s Child Study Lab, which was established in 2010 by a $10 million grant from the National Science Foundation, and collaborators at Weill Cornell Medical College were awarded last year with a $1.7 million grant from the National Institutes of Health. The grant will help researchers collect new data, using the datasets created over the past decade to develop automated tools that better and more efficiently characterize behaviors that are present and important in typical child development but are often considered to be core, early-emerging markers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when absent.
[RELATED: Using Computer Science to Augment Autism Research at Georgia Tech (VIDEO)]
Psychologists have long understood that there were links between early childhood development and the likelihood of typical language and behavior outcomes throughout life. What they weren’t able to do, however, was to study childhood behavior at a granular level similar to that of a microscope. Given the importance of early detection to inform proper interventions, the tedium of human coding and analysis poses a significant challenge.
“That process is manual and driven by humans specifying what happens in a frame of a video,” said Jim Rehg, a professor in the School of Interactive Computing and the principal investigator on the NIH award. “It takes hours upon hours of data collection and analysis.”
Computing could alter that reality, and this work being done at Georgia Tech is a significant reason why.
“Given enough video, we can model the details of behavior,” Rehg said. “Deep learning, married with the ability to collect the data, allows us to build out how our algorithms work in much the same way computer science has been applied to genetics and imaging to make those more powerful and scalable.”
That has long been the mission of the Child Study Lab, and the latest grant will continue to move the needle forward in autism research at Georgia Tech and beyond. Unlike many other conditions, autism spectrum disorder can’t be found by taking a blood test or viewing images of the brain. Doctors must analyze behavior through developmental screenings and comprehensive diagnostic evaluations.
During screenings, doctors might talk or play with a child to see how they learn, speak, or behave. Do they exhibit typical communicative skills like joint attention, in which two people use gestures or gaze to share their attention with respect to other objects or events? The skills a child demonstrates in these areas are known to be strong indicators of how they will develop throughout childhood and adolescence.
The challenge here is that, given how important it is to detect ASD at an early age and thus tailor interventions and education to meet the child’s specific needs, the manual labor that comes with these screenings and evaluations makes it far less efficient than detection of other developmental challenges. Autism spectrum disorder affects one in 59 children in the United States alone, and not all who are screened are ultimately determined to be one of those individuals.
The need for objective, automated measurements of behavior is clear, and Rehg – along with IC Research Scientist Agata Rozga, Child Study Lab coordinator Audrey Southerland, collaborators at Weill Cornell, and more – are taking steps in that direction.
“For us, the goal is to use these computational capabilities to extract the important key moments and information to give clinicians or psychologists the ability to more easily examine a child’s behavior,” Southerland said. “If we can provide additional details through technology about the quality or coordination of important social and communicative behaviors, we can hopefully provide behavioral experts with the capability of exploring these behaviors in much greater detail than currently possible.”
The first grant from the NSF funded the creation of the Child Study Lab, which has over the years developed an extensive dataset of behaviors in typically developing children. At the time, it was the first large-scale investment in technology that would assist in modeling and sensing behaviors that underlie developmental conditions like autism spectrum disorder. Additional grants have assisted in studies that use computer vision to measure and detect gaze shifts or wearable technology and machine learning to detect and differentiate between types of problem behaviors.
The NIH grant brings all the past research together to compare what the sensory data says in relation to human coding, and how that might ultimately serve to develop reliable, objective, automated tools for measuring early, nonverbal communication behaviors.
“The important thing is for us to make sure that whatever we produce is good enough so that we can actually push it out into the field to people who are specializing in this area,” Southerland said. “We never want to get rid of the human expert in this field, but we want to build technology they can use to augment and streamline their analysis of behavior.”
In addition to the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, the Child Study Lab has also received funding from the Simons Foundation and has partnered with external entities like the Marcus Autism Center.
Southerland and the Child Study Lab are actively seeking families with young children to participate in this study to further develop their automated tools. Anyone interested in playing a part in this exciting work can visit the lab’s website to learn more.

IC’s Caitlyn Seim to Serve as Spring Ph.D. Commencement Speaker
School of Interactive Computing Ph.D. student Caitlyn Seim will serve as commencement speaker for the Georgia Tech Ph.D. graduation ceremony on May 3.
Seim, who is advised by IC Professor Thad Starner, was chosen by a committee of leaders from across campus, including the Office of the Dean of Students, various faculty, and commencement officials. The process included an audition of a speech written by Seim.
Having recently defended her dissertation for her degree in Human-Centered Computing, Seim said that she is honored by her selection and opportunity to share the stage with Georgia Tech President Bud Peterson and Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Faculty Affairs Bonnie Ferri.
“I am so thrilled to represent the graduating class, and I can’t wait to share my message about the importance of research,” Seim said. “I love Georgia Tech so much. After all my time here, I still enjoy it as if it were my first day on campus.”
Seim, whose research in wearable computing and passive haptic rehabilitation has been covered extensively by external media, said that in her speech she hopes to help graduates think about a recent realization that she had.
“That is the significant role we have in society’s progress,” she said. “It’s about the formation of knowledge and how Ph.D. students are uniquely trained to evaluate fact and expand what society can achieve. My training in the Human-Centered Computing program actually helped me to begin recognizing this by introducing me to the concept of epistemology.”
Looking back, Seim will remember Georgia Tech as a unique student body and a beautiful campus.
“For me, I have to put special emphasis on the academic community,” she said. “The faculty made learning a great experience, and as a graduate student I felt like I was really part of a community. The student researchers who I mentor continue to impress me and consistently show curiosity, respect, and dedication. It has been a pleasure working with everyone.”
The Ph.D. commencement ceremony will take place at 9-10:30 a.m. Friday, May 3, at McCamish Pavilion. Ferri will also speak. No tickets are required for the event.
IC Researchers Seek to Improve Treatment for Schizophrenia Under New $2.7 Million NIMH Grant
For the past few years, Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing Assistant Professor Munmun De Choudhury has pursued research that gathers insights about mental health through digital traces individuals leave behind on social media.
Under a new $2.7 million grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH), she and a team of researchers at Northwell Health will apply that new information in a clinical setting in hopes of improving treatment.
“In our past research, we have gained a number of new insights, but I see an opportunity to influence real world people and outcomes,” De Choudhury said. “Going beyond just academic and empirical findings, how do you take that information and make a difference in people’s lives? What research challenges do such translations pose to the computing domain?”
This grant offers the researchers that opportunity. It will be one of the first in which computing researchers and leading experts in psychiatry research are coming together to influence how treatment can be delivered harnessing patient-contributed data. The grant is funded through a new NIMH program designed to inform and support delivery of high quality mental health services.
The idea is to build machine learning algorithms based on data that mental health patients voluntarily share with the research team, including both clinicians at Northwell Health and researchers in De Choudhury’s lab at Georgia Tech. With these algorithms, they hope to identify different risk markers and symptom changes that appear in social media posts to identify changes and trends in an individual over time.
By combing a number of different social media sources, primarily Facebook and Twitter, they will look at the use of words or patterns of words an individual uses. In mental illnesses like schizophrenia, the main population they will explore, that is important information to know.
“If they are feeling delusional or experiencing paranoia, what is it that they are saying,” De Choudhury said. “We can look at social interactions and see whether they might be feeling isolation, which can have a negative impact on mental health. Nuances of language styles, like the way people use articles or pronouns, can say a lot about their psychological state, as well, which has been shown in our and co-investigator (University of Texas Professor) Jamie Pennebaker’s prior work.”
The population they will focus on comprises younger individuals, largely teens and early 20s, who have had a first episode of schizophrenia. Most will have only recently been diagnosed and admitted to a specialized treatment facility directed by the collaborators on the project in New York. The goal is to use the information gathered in their digital traces to identify risk markers that signal a potential relapse.
“Schizophrenia is a challenging and debilitating illness,” De Choudhury said. “Even people under treatment have a high chance of relapse with negative outcomes on quality of life, productivity, and functioning. Symptoms often come back, and most mental illnesses are only managed, not cured.”
Better management means that the treatment is timely and highly adaptable to the patient’s needs, De Choudhury said. Unfortunately, that’s a challenge because, in clinical settings, there is very little knowledge about a patient’s day-to-day life. Unlike a disease such as cancer, which has an objective screening that can identify its presence and severity, mental illnesses are based on what is reported. These self-reports are often skewed, based on what a patient wants to tell or remembers.
“In some ways, the treatment paradigm right now is not very evidence based,” she said. “But to prevent relapse, it’s important that we try to be as precise and proactive as possible.”
The project will span four years and began on April 15.
Cleaning Up Those Messy Notebooks Just Got A Lot Easier
This year’s ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems best paper award winner has developed a set of tools to help programmers and data scientists clean up their computational notebooks so they can program more effectively and efficiently.
“Programming in computational notebooks is helpful for seeing intermediate pieces of code and results interlaced together, but often these notebooks become very long and messy. This likely resonates with many students, but also data science and industry professionals, since it is a widely used technology,” said School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Ph.D. student and co-investigator of the paper, Fred Hohman.
The set of tools, called code gathering tools, allow the user to go to any part of a long notebook, such as a certain variable or equation hidden in messy code, and pull out the relevant information.
“What we did is create a means to pull out, or gather, a desired item out of a large notebook and show all its changes from previous versions. This will show you what minimal set of code you need to get a certain result,” said Hohman.
In conjunction with efficiency, this tool also helps with reproducibility, sharing code, and communication by helping analysts find, clean, recover, and compare versions of code in cluttered, inconsistent notebooks.
According to the paper, Managing Messes in Computational Notebooks, the tools also archive all versions of code outputs, allowing analysts to review these versions and recover the subsets of code that produced them. These subsets can serve as succinct summaries of analysis activity or starting points for new analyses.

Demo Day Shows Future of Cybersecurity is Machine Learning
A School of Computer Science team won the Institute for Information Security and Privacy’s (IISP) Demo Day Finale for their work on making machine learning (ML) models more secure.
The winning project, MLsploit, is a framework for developers to test their ML model against a variety of attacks to strengthen its security. It can be used to evaluate video, image, and audio data, and also includes cybersecurity protections against malware and network intrusions. This research is vital as ML’s prominence makes it more at risk to attacks, which could include forcing self-driving cars to run stop signs.
“We’re not just interested in how accurately we can classify a dataset; we’re interested in how robust the model is and how well it thwarts attacks,” said Evan Downing, the SCS Ph.D. student who presented from the group.
The Demo Day Finale was the culmination of a yearlong annual competition that gives students the opportunity to commercialize their research for up to $125,000 in prizes. Students first presented at IISP’s fall Cybersecurity Summit, where the most promising projects were offered funding and mentorship from industry leaders. The three student-led commercialization projects showcased the future of cybersecurity research, including biometric authentication, preventing power grid attacks, and ML security.
At the April 16 finale, a student from each team gave a TED-style talk on their work and answered questions from three business leaders – Tech Square Ventures Managing Partner Blake Patton, IBM Security Director of Business and Corporate Development Richard Telljohann, and TDF Ventures Venture Partner John Schanz – who were looking for research that showed novelty and innovation in the market. They chose MLsploit for its practical applications.
With the encouraging nod from the judges, and $7,000 from IISP in funding, Downing and his team plan to continue improving MLsploit’s capabilities and release it as an open source tool.
MLsploit is the work of SCS Ph.D. students Downing, Jinho Jung, and Carter Yagemann; School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Ph.D. students Shang-Tse Chen and Nilaksh Das; CSE Associate Professors Polo Chau and Le Song; and SCS Associate Professor Taesoo Kim, with Professor Wenke Lee acting as advisor.
“It can be difficult to apply academic research to the needs of industry, so it's encouraging to hear interest from companies in our tool,” Downing said. “It motivates me to work even harder to provide them a product they can use in the real world that also has impact in research.”
Cybersecurity Experts Receive Faculty Promotions
Two faculty members in the School of Computer Science (SCS) have been promoted. Taesoo Kim was granted tenure as an associate professor, and Associate Chair Alexandra Boldyreva became a full professor.
“In his short time at Georgia Tech, Taesoo Kim has become a world leader in systems security, director of the System Software and Security Center, and a critical member of the Institute for Information Security and Privacy,” SCS Chair Lance Fortnow said.
“Sasha Boldyreva is an expert in applied cryptography, particularly in searchable encryptions, and we are honored to have them both on our faculty.”
Boldyreva has been a cryptographer in SCS since 2005. She is a leader in her field, co-editing the Cryptology ePrint archive, working as an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, and co-chairing the largest cryptography conference—CRYPTO—in 2018 and 2019.

Professor Receives Mozilla Grant to Teach Social Responsibility in Computing
School of Computer Science Professor Ellen Zegura’s project to incorporate ethics in undergraduate computer science classes has been selected for Mozilla’s Responsible Computer Science Challenge.
With $150,000 in funding, Zegura will teach social responsibility in computing through role-playing games (RPG) that show students how a new technology could impact the public. One RPG will simulate an internal company discussion about the ethics of new technology such as facial recognition. The other RPG models a community meeting about allowing a new technology, like self-driving cars, into an area.
Zegura, the Stephen Fleming Chair for Telecommunications, will supplement the RPGs by creating a Responsible Computer Science Fellows Program for training undergraduate teaching assistants and lecturers on how to build ethics into a lecture. She will also conduct video interviews with College of Computing faculty members to show the ethical considerations they make in their work, which students will watch in class.
“I am delighted to work with the Division of Computing Instruction, colleagues across the College of Computing, and ethics experts in public policy on bringing ethical considerations to our undergraduate students as they learn what it means to think like a computer scientist,” Zegura said.
The project is one of 17 initiatives receiving $2.4 million in prizes for the first phase of the program from Mozilla, Omidyar Network, Schmidt Futures, and Craig Newmark Philanthropies. Nineteen independent judges chose projects that change teaching style or course requirements to integrate ethics into current undergraduate computer science classes.
Two Georgia Tech Alums Receive Prestigious Awards at CHI 2019
Two former Georgia Tech students were recognized by the CHI community this week in Glasgow, U.K., one for her overall contributions in human-computer interaction at the conference and another for her long history of promoting social action within the community.
Jennifer Mankoff, one of Professor Gregory Abowd’s first of 30 Ph.D graduates in 2001, was inducted into the prestigious CHI Academy this week, and Gillian Hayes (2007), also advised by Abowd, was awarded the Social Impact award.
Mankoff, who was Abowd’s third ever Ph.D. graduate, joined an exclusive community that includes eight Georgia Tech faculty members. Most recently, Professor Amy Bruckman was inducted a year ago.
Mankoff noted the mentors, like Abowd, she had along the way to give her that opportunity. Abowd provided the introduction for Mankoff at the awards ceremony for the CHI academy. She credited her research community and the CHI community for giving her the freedom to pursue the kind of research that she was passionate about.
“The openness to let people be able to work on whatever they’re passionate about and see that has value is something that’s been important to me over the years,” Mankoff said. “More than once, I’ve shifted to another area that I wasn’t working in before and maybe a lot of others weren’t either. It’s a sign of how open the community is.”
Seated at a reunion party for the Abowd “family” – academics who were part of a lineage that began as doctoral students in Abowd’s lab – she noted the importance of having a vibrant community like that.
“We were very lucky to be there at the beginning, helping to form his group and to learn from him and all the energy he brings to this group,” she said. “It’s one of the strongest networks I have at CHI.”
Hayes received her Social Impact award just 12 years after Abowd received his own in 2007. She said it was an especially proud honor to have the distinction of following in the footsteps of her advisor.
“The way he has instilled in us an ethos of being able to give back, being able to bake in community outcomes with our research outcomes and define good, interesting research problems that also really solve real-world problems, and work in partnership with communities,” Hayes said.
Hayes, whose 30-minute talk at the conference focused on ways in which the community needed to do better in thinking about issues of accessibility, access, racial and gender inequities, and much more, said she thought the CHI community was leading the way as a standard-bearer for diversity, inclusion, and service.
“But we still have a long way to go,” she said.
Her talk, she hoped, would be a call to action to the rest of the community.
“This is our time, and we can control our destinies and we can create truly community-driven innovation,” she said.

Tool First to Automate App 'Slicing' for Developers
Whether it's a theme park, music festival, or vacation destination, there's always a new app. But, downloading a new app onto an already cluttered smartphone can be challenging, particularly with limited network connectivity.
A new plug-in tool created at Georgia Tech for app developers, however, lets people select and use relevant "slices" of an app without the entire download on their phone. Known as "AppSlicer", the tool builds on existing dynamic program slicing capabilities, but it is the first of its kind to eliminate the need for additional coding by automating the process for app developers.
“If the network is as fast as the card on my phone, why would I ever need to install an app? We created AppSlicer, so you wouldn’t have to,” said Ketan Bhardwaj, a research scientist in Georgia Tech's College of Computing who worked on the tool.
To confirm its functionality, AppSlicer was tested on the top 50 apps in the Google Play store. The research team found that the slices served up through their new development tool had security and performance levels equal to those of complete apps.
"By providing only the necessary parts of an app, and then automatically deleting them when no longer in use, AppSlicer saves people time and phone storage space, all with the same user interface and experience they would have with the complete app," Bhardwaj said.
AppSlicer uses dynamic program slicing to determine when an app uses each resource, then divides the app into only these functional elements. Each of these slices can carry out a single task, like determining a ride wait time at a theme park. The tool also expands on existing capabilities by taking advantage of a user’s smartphone network. If a slice isn’t complete, or the user wants to access other app features, the app still works because AppSlicer relies on the network — not the phone — and handles any issues without the user ever knowing.
“In other domains, you have to be precise about the slice, but with app slicing, even approximate slicing makes huge improvements in performance and doesn’t jeopardize service because AppSlicer dynamically streams missing app components. Correctness is never a factor,” said Ada Gavrilovska, School of Computer Science associate professor.
AppSlicer currently only works on Android, but Gavrilovska and Bhardwaj see this work only gaining momentum as the app economy grows. Soon, apps could be customized for specific contexts and different types of devices. They also believe it’s part of a bigger trend in systems research, edge computing, where computation is done closer to the source.
“There are a lot of user-facing cases that won’t work when served from the cloud, so this is just one example we can quantify where there are gaps in the traditional device-cloud model that edge computing can improve,” Gavrilovska said.
Bhardwaj and Gavrilovska presented the research in the paper Serving Mobile Apps — A Slice at a Time, co-authored with master’s students Nikita Juneja and Matt Saunders. It was an accepted paper at EuroSys 2019 in Dresden, Germany, at the end of March.
Identifying Differences in Disease-causing Genomes Just Went from a Few Days to a Few Hours
From disease-causing organisms to mutations caused by cancer, the first step in diagnosing many health concerns often begins with identifying variations in genomes. But, this can take several days with existing technology.
A new algorithm developed at Georgia Tech, however, is shifting this paradigm by dramatically reducing the time it takes to identify genomic variations in a cell or organism to just a few hours or even minutes.
“The faster these variations can be determined, the more quickly a treatment can be prescribed and an outbreak can be thwarted. This is why we need to analyze variations in genomes as accurately and quickly as possible,” said Chirag Jain, the lead investigator on the project.
"Aligning DNA sequences to an annotated reference is a key step for genotyping in biology,” said Jain. “That is why we created PasGAL, the first multi-core parallel algorithm that can align a sequence to a complex genome graph."
“That is why matching a DNA sequence to a reference graph, as is done with PasGAL, speeds up the process of genome analysis so remarkably,” he said.
The software packaging PasGAL, co-designed by School of Computational Science and Engineering and Intel researchers, utilizes modern computer architectures that are able to leverage multiple cores to perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously.
Jain said, “The previous way of identifying variations in genomes was to use reference DNA from a particular individual – which could only asses a single individual genome at a time. This method did not use the extensive genomics data now available across multiple individuals and populations.
Recent studies indicate that by using a graph rather than a linear reference, it is possible to include multiple genomes of multiple individuals simultaneously.
“Now, we are able to compute optimal alignments of DNA sets to large graphs and multiple genomes within a few minutes or hours, which was not feasible with prior algorithms.”
According to Jain, the team intends for this module to eventually be used with other software so that it can be directly used in hospitals and labs for quick analysis.
This research won best poster award at RECOMB 2019 and will be presented as part of the advanced program at the 33rdIEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium next week.

New Techniques May Increase Effective Use of Network Bandwidth
New research from Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) presents a pioneering method of overlapping communications with communications to more effectively use available network bandwidth.
The approach allows for actual data transfer in one operation to be overlapped with overheads, or any combination of memory, bandwidth, or other resources required to perform a specific task, in another operation. This method, and its two suggested techniques, are used on a key kernel in electronic structure calculations, and show up to 91.2 percent faster speeds.
“Communication-intensive applications that use collective operations like broadcast and reduction are likely to benefit from this method. Our techniques are simple to implement and may give better communication performance to such existing applications by modifying just a few lines of code,” said CSE Ph.D. student Hua Huang, the primary investigator of the research.
“We are planning to study the impact of these techniques on more applications. From a computational science perspective, our results may raise the awareness of MPI library developers and inspire them to design better implementations for some communication operations.”
Huang and CSE Associate Professor Edmond Chow are presenting a paper detailing their work this week at the 33rd IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS 2019).

Janus Finds More Bugs in File Systems than any Fuzzer
Georgia Tech researchers have created the first fuzzing framework specifically for file systems that finds memory corruptions better than any existing tool.
Known as Janus, the new framework was tested on eight Linux file systems where it found 90 bugs. It could also reproduce almost all crashes, which no other framework has accomplished before.
Limits of fuzzers
File systems manage user data stored on a disk image. They are the building blocks of any OS, but their size and complexity makes bugs a frequent issue. These bugs can have catastrophic consequences: system reboots, OS deadlock, unrecoverable errors, and security risks.
Because constant updates and system optimizations tend to create more bugs, and removing bugs individually isn’t practical, developers rely on fuzzing. This generalized automatic software testing technique injects mutated inputs to find bugs and test the strength of the system.
Current fuzzers, however, have three limitations, according to the researchers:
- Fuzzing the disk image is inefficient.
- File systems run on two inputs: the disk image and operations, but no existing fuzzer can run both at the same time.
- Fuzzers don’t run on a real-time OS, instead producing crashes on no longer relevant OS.
“We found that existing fuzzers normally keep running new test cases without rebooting the OS between two test runs, meaning after a certain amount of time, we are using an aging OS to test our input,” said School of Computer Science (SCS) Ph.D. student Wen Xu. “This results in unstable OS execution, and any found crash is very hard to reproduce.”
Fixing fuzzers
Janus overcomes these limitations by mutating the metadata in the disk image directly and producing file operations in this context, called system calls, to explore the file system simultaneously. By mutating the metadata only, Janus creates smaller input test cases, which enables more comprehensive system-wide fuzzing.
Janus runs both inputs at the same time by using the image to generate operations. It then strategically schedules the fuzzing image and fuzzing operations.
Lastly, Janus relies on a library OS based application, or executor, to fuzz OS functionalities. This avoids using an aging OS or file system that results in unstable executions and irreproducible bugs. This requires less computing resources, which enables Janus to fuzz on a larger scale.
“Janus provides a one-stop solution to generate test cases of high quality for comprehensive file system testing,” said Xu. “But this is just the start. By extending Janus, developers can easily find other types of bugs in file systems and file systems on other operating systems.”
Xu presented the work in the paper Fuzzing File Systems via Two-Dimensional Input Space Exploration, co-written with SCS Ph.D. student Sanidhya Kashyap, master’s student Po-Ning Tseng, SCS Associate Professor Taesoo Kim, and Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Assistant Professor Hyungon Moon. The paper was accepted into IEEE’s Symposium on Security and Privacy in San Francisco in late May.
Suitable for Framing: Galil Portrait 'Captures Something Real'
Good news! Although Dean Zvi Galil is stepping down on June 30, you will still be able to see him every day in the College of Computing hallway.
A new portrait of Galil now hangs just outside the dean’s suite in the College of Computing Building. The framed oil painting of Galil joins portraits of his John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing predecessors, founding dean Peter Freeman, and Richard DeMillo.
The painting was unveiled on May 3 as part of the College’s Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Freeman, who served as master of ceremonies for this part of the event, spoke about Galil’s lasting contributions to the GT Computing community just before the unveiling of the portrait for Zvi and the 125-plus guests in attendance.
The painting, approximately 24 inches tall and 20 inches wide, is by renowned portrait artist Sergei Chernikov. He also painted DeMillo’s portrait so, according to LaDonna Cherry, the College’s creative services manager, it made sense to work with Chernikov on Zvi’s portrait.
“I’ve always admired Sergei’s portrait of DeMillo. He has a classic sensibility and a real talent for using color and light to identify and animate something real about his portraiture subjects,” said Cherry, art director for the project. “I think that this is certainly true of Zvi’s portrait.”
[RELATED: Charles Isbell Named Next Dean of the College of Computing]
Work to get to the unveiling began in August 2018. That’s when Birney Robert – College event coordinator and project leader – received approval to engage Portrait Associates, a local firm representing artists available for a commission from across the country, to identify an artist for the project.
Once he agreed to pick up the commission, Chernikov was provided a few photos of Galil taken by the College's staff photographer, Terence Rushin. These images served as a starting point for a series of sketches and color studies. With feedback from Robert and Cherry, Chernikov refined these early works over the next few months until he was ready to proceed with the final portrait.

“Zvi means so much to the College community that we wanted to make absolutely sure that this portrait was done right,” said Robert, who holds a bachelor of fine arts degree.
“I’m happy to say, I think Sergei nailed it!”
New Machine Learning Algorithms Reduce Bias in Identifying Groups
A new approach is the first of its kind to address fairness in a popular graph analysis technique used by banks, social networks, and others to identify groups, according to Georgia Tech researchers.
The approach couples new machine learning (ML) algorithms with spectral clustering analysis – a common method for identifying groups by revealing often hidden connections between people in massive, multi-dimensional graphs. The researchers found that groups identified using the new method were as much as 34 percent more diverse than those identified using spectral clustering alone.
“Obviously, you want to figure out who the communities are, but you also want them to be diverse,” said School of Computer Science (SCS) Ph.D. student Samira Samadi and research team member.
As a starting point, the team defined diversity for the project as a representation of each demographic that is proportional between an identified group, also known as a cluster, and the original dataset. The researchers tested their algorithms on a natural variant of the stochastic block model, a famous random graph model used to study the performance of clustering algorithms. On this model, they proved the efficacy of the new algorithms to return diverse clusters in the data.
Beyond the theoretical, the researchers also tested the algorithms on empirical datasets. These tests confirmed the previous findings that the new approach can deliver more proportionally balanced clusters with minimal impact on interconnectivity or quality of the clusters.
“Designing fair clustering algorithms helps ML to draw a more diverse image of communities in a network,” Samadi said. “This not only leads to less representational bias toward specific demographics, but could also help marketers to maximize their full potential customer base.”
The researchers presented their work in the paper, Guarantees for Spectral Clustering with Fairness Constraints, at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) in Long Beach, California, from June 9 to 15. Samadi co-wrote the paper with SCS Assistant Professor Jamie Morgenstern, Rutgers postdoctoral researcher Matthäus Kleindessner, and Rutgers Assistant Professor Pranjal Awasthi.

Deep Learning Model Cuts Time to Produce Hi-Res. Land Cover Maps
A new approach enables the first large-scale charting method that can quickly create high-resolution land maps at a fraction of the cost.
Identifying land cover types from high-resolution satellite imagery is crucial to addressing many sustainability-related issues. However, the process of mapping this information is expensive, computationally complex, and time-consuming.
As a result, portions of these maps can be outdated before they reach conservationists, planners, researchers, and others that rely on this information to make decisions impacting the environment. To provide these groups with timely and actionable land cover maps, a Microsoft research team led by Georgia Tech Ph.D. student Caleb Robinson has developed a new approach that combines satellite and aerial imager with advanced deep learning techniques.
The result is the first high-resolution land cover map of the contiguous United States.
“The goal is to identify and summarize changes in land cover on the scale of days,” said Robinson. “The scale of days is extremely important as this can inform conservation agencies as to how effective their interventions are or this can highlight potential problem areas such as rapid loss of forest cover.”
The new web-based mapping tool is funded by Microsoft AI for Earth and can show daily changes in land cover types such as water, forests, fields, and human developments. It uses a method originally developed for electron microscopy known as multi-resolution data fusion. The method scans all of the imagery at a low resolution, while also collecting a fraction of hi-res. data points at the same time. The two are then merged using existing modeling techniques to create high-quality maps that can be updated in a matter of days rather than in weeks or even months.
“Other deep learning–based methods for land cover mapping have shown to be effective but are limited in their scale,” said Robinson. “By developing methods for generalizing models to new regions, we have achieved high-quality results for the entire U.S.”
To highlight the effectiveness of their new approach the team points to a land cover map of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. The Chesapeake Conservancy spent 10 months and $1.3 million to produce the map for an approximately 64,299 square-mile area. In comparison, the team using its new tool was able to produce a hi-res. land cover map of the contiguous U.S. – all 3.20 million square miles of it – within a week for a cost of $5,000.
Bistra Dilkina, a School of Computational Science and Engineering adjunct professor and researcher who specializes in technology for conservation, is a co-investigator on this project and Robinson’s advisor.
"Overall, artificial intelligence has a lot to offer in helping conserve our environment, from land cover mapping and detection of degradation to optimizing conservation planning and predicting risk of illegal wildlife poaching in protected areas,” she said.
The deep learning method and a detailed account of how the team collaborated with the Chesapeake Conservancy is outlined in a paper, presented at the premier annual computer vision conference, CVPR 2019, on June 20.
An addition to the map outlined in the paper is a new web interface that allows users to:
- Explore land cover model predictions
- Fine-tune the model to new geographic areas
- Extend the model with new, user-defined classes
- Download resulting land cover data
The code for training and testing these models can be accessed here.

New Methods of Reordering Sparse Tensors Show Measurable Increases in Speed
A team of researchers, which includes several School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) faculty, has created two tensor reordering methods, BFS-MCS and Lexi-Order, that are proven to be more effective for storing and operating efficiently with sparse tensors than current state-of-the-art approaches.
On modern multicore central processing units, the reordering algorithm Lexi-Order obtains up to 4.14 times speedup on sequential HiCOO-MTTKRP – a sparse tensor format with one of the most computationally expensive kernels in sparse tensor computations – and 11.88 times speedup on its parallel counterpart.
The full findings from the paper introducing these methods will be presented this Thursday, June 27, at the International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS).
For those new to tensors, a tensor is an algebraic object related to space that provides a natural and concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving problems in computational science. These objects are represented in the form of cubes, with the X and Y axis depths ranging according to the size of data entries they can hold.
Tensors are fed information in the form of numeric data from a variety of applications but, oftentimes, these entries mainly consist of zeroes. In these instances, the tensors are considered sparse and do not need to be stored or explicitly computed on.
The primary investigator of this research, Jiajia Li, is a staff scientist at the High Performance Computing (HPC) group of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and recent doctoral graduate of CSE. Li has led research on sparse tensors in the past, including Supercomputing 2018 Best Student Paper Award winning work, HiCOO, which this new work builds upon.

“A sparse tensor is often a natural way to represent a multifactor or multi-relational dataset, and has found numerous applications in data analysis and mining for healthcare, natural language processing, machine learning, and social network analytics, among many others,” she said.
“This paper formalizes the problem of reordering a sparse tensor to improve the spatial and temporal locality of operations within it, and proposes two reordering algorithms for this problem.”
According to Li, there are a variety of data structures and techniques for storing and operating efficiently with sparse tensors. One technique is to reorder the tensor, which means relabeling the indices – and, therefore, reorganizing the nonzero structure of the tensor.
One form of reordering explored in prior work is to sort the input tensor which can improve locality, but simultaneously aggravates load balance.
She said, “We observe that reordering increases imbalance by as much as 6.7 times in practice. In this paper, we propose improvements to the data structure and corresponding algorithms that address this problem. A new partition-based superblock scheduling is also proposed for the HiCOO format to improve load balance.”
The team of investigators for this paper include Li, PNNL Team Lead Scientist Kevin Barker, French National Center for Scientific Research Scientist Bora Ucar, and CSE Professors Umit Catalyurek, Jimeng Sun, and Rich Vuduc.
The code is released as part of Parallel Tensor Infrastructure (ParTI!) and can be found here.
Queer in AI Fosters Inclusion in the Research Community
Gender bias is one of the most pressing issues in artificial intelligence (AI) today, but what if even just sorting data by gender is part of the problem? This question is one of many that the group Queer in AI asks.
College of Computing alumnus and Google AI Resident Rapha Gontijo Lopes co-founded the group in 2018 to create a community for queer researchers and to raise awareness of LGBTQIA+ issues in AI and machine learning (ML).
Lopes has been active in the AI research community since he joined the College’s student AI networking and discussion group, the Agency, in his sophomore year. As a gay Latino man, though, he didn’t feel welcome at conferences, where other queer people are hard enough to find, let alone a nuanced discussion of gender in a dataset. After he attended the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) in 2017, he realized there wasn’t a group for queer people in the field. So, Lopes helped start Queer in AI.
One of the most basic ways it fosters community and sparks conversation is by hosting socials at prominent conferences for queer researchers to network.
“A lot of researchers might not have the community we do as queer people from cities, but they can see Queer in AI at a conference and not find it’s another environment they feel out of place,” he said.
Although Queer in AI is for the LGBTQIA+ community, it’s inclusive to all. When possible, events are scheduled within the same building as the conference, so everyone from allies to people who may not be out to their community can attend.
The group also offers workshops to raise awareness of fairness and accountability issues in AI. These panels may be about inclusion through gender-neutral bathrooms and stickers where attendees can display their pronouns. They also raise awareness for research issues such the role of gender in natural language processing or ensuring people aren’t erased from data because they don’t fall into the gender binary.
“There are some implicit assumptions about the things we do in AI,” Lopes said. “The way we challenge them and reevaluate how we think about them is important.”
Although the group put on its first event less than a year ago at NeurIPS in Montreal, it’s already a success. It has hosted social mixers at four major conferences and workshops at two events with 50 to 90 people attending each event. According to Lopes, the goal is to continue to expand. He hopes Queer in AI will have a presence at every major ML and AI conference and eventually offer conference scholarships for queer researchers. Beyond conferences, Lopes said it’s also about creating a community year-round through the group’s mailing list.
“We want to make sure ML systems aren't another force of oppression in society, and we're positive about its future,” Lopes said. “There are so many awesome people who do research on fairness and justice in AI and radical AI. Queer in AI is lifting those voices and bring awareness to fairness and accountability.”
Georgia Tech Team Wins New Fetch Robot at ICRA's FetchIt! Mobile Manipulation Challenge
A paper published in the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR) by researchers in the School of Interactive Computing (IC) was selected as the 2018 IJRR Paper of the Year.
Chosen from a shortlist considered by the IJRR Executive Committee, the paper, Continuous-time Gaussian Process Motion Planning via Probabilistic Inference, was recognized for its technical rigor, relevance, and potential for impact in the robotics research community. The research comes from IC Ph.D. students Mustafa Mukadam, Jing Dong, and Xinyan Yan, and advisors Professor Frank Dellaert and Assistant Professor Byron Boots.
This paper introduces a novel formulation of motion planning that treats the problem of finding an efficient, feasible path between two points as probabilistic inference with Gaussian Processes. Motion planning is a hard problem, and state-of-the art sampling-based and trajectory optimization algorithms have well-known drawbacks. The former can effectively find feasible trajectories but often exhibits jerky and redundant motion, and the latter requires a fine approximation of the trajectory to reason about thin obstacles or tight constraints.
In their paper, the team of researchers adopts a continuous-time representation of trajectories, viewing them as functions that map time to robot state. Combing this representation with fast approaches to probabilistic inference, they developed a computationally-efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm called a Gaussian Process Motion Planner that can overcome large computational costs associated with fine discretization, while still maintaining smoothness of motion in the result.
With the award comes a $1,000 prize. Boots attended the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference in the Freiburg, Germany, this week, where he accepted the award on behalf of his team.
Another paper involving Boots was also awarded a Best Student Paper Award at RSS. Titled An Online Learning Approach to Model Predictive Control, the paper was written by Robotics Ph.D. students Nolan Wagener, Ching-An Cheng, and Jacob Sacks, along with Boots.
It shows that there exists a close connection between model predictive control (MPC), a popular technique for solving dynamic control tasks, and online learning, an abstract theoretical framework for analyzing online decision making. This new perspective provides a foundation for leveraging powerful online learning algorithms to design MPC algorithms. Toward this end, the researchers propose a generic framework for synthesizing new MPC algorithms called Dynamic Mirror Decent Model Predictive Control.
The framework exposes key design choices that can help practitioners easily develop new control algorithms tailored to the challenges of their specific task. The approach is validated by developing new MPC algorithms that consistently match or outperform the state-of-the-art on several tasks including an aggressive driving problem with the goal of racing an autonomous car around a dirt track under computational resource constraints.
IC's Dhruv Batra Named PECASE Winner, One of Three at Georgia Tech
School of Interactive Computing Assistant Professor Dhruv Batra was awarded the prestigious Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) on Wednesday in an announcement by President Donald Trump. The PECASE is the highest honor bestowed by the United States government to outstanding scientists and engineers beginning independent research careers.
Batra is one of three Georgia Tech faculty members this year to earn the award, giving the Institute a total of 18 in its history. The other two awardees in this class are Associate Professor Mark Davenport of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Assistant Professor Matthew McDowell of the School of Materials Science and Engineering.
Along with the Department of Defense, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy will provide $1 million over the course of five years to support Batra’s research to make artificial intelligence (AI) systems more transparent, explainable, and trustworthy. The award comes as a result of Batra’s selection for a similar early-career award by the Army Research Office Young Investigator Program in 2014.
The research Batra’s lab will pursue with the funding addresses a fundamental challenge in development of AI – their “black-box” nature, the consequent difficulty humans face in identifying why or how AI systems fail, and how to improve upon those technologies. When a self-driving car from a major tech company, for example, suffered its first fatality in 2015, legal and regulatory agencies understandably questioned what went wrong. The challenge at the time was providing a sufficient answer to that question.
“Your response can’t just be, ‘Well, there was this machine learning box in there, and it just didn’t detect the car. We don’t know why,’” Batra said.
Batra’s research aims to create AI systems that can more readily explain what they do and why. This could come in the form of natural language or visual explanations, both of which – computer vision and natural language processing – are central areas of focus in Batra’s lab. The machine could, for example, identify regions in image that provide support for its predictions, potentially assisting a user’s understanding of what the machine can or cannot do.
It’s an important area of study for a few reasons, Batra said. He classifies AI technology into three levels of maturity:
- Level 1 is technology that is in its infancy. It is not near deployment to everyday users, and the consumers of the technology are researchers. The goal for transparency and explanation is to help researchers and developers to understand the failure modes and current limitations, and deduce how to improve the technology – “actionable insight,” as Batra called it.
- Level 2 is when things are working to a degree, enough so that the technology can and has been deployed.
“The technology may be mature in a narrow range, and you can ship the product,” Batra said. “Like face detection or fingerprint technology. It’s built into products and being used at agencies, airports, or other places.”
In such cases, you want explanations and interpretability that helps build appropriate trust with users. Users can understand when the system reliably works and when it might not work – face detection in bad lighting, for example – and make efforts to use in a more appropriate setting.
- Level 3 is typically a fairly narrow category where the AI is better – sometimes significantly so – than the human. Batra used chess-playing and Go-playing bots as an example. The best chess-playing bots convincingly outperform the best humans and reliably hand a resounding defeat to the average human player.
“We already know bots play much better than humans,” he said. “In such cases, you don’t need to improve the machine and you already trust its skill level. You want the machine to give you explanations not so that you can improve the AI, but so that you can improve yourself.”
Batra envisions scenarios where the techniques his lab develops could assist at all three levels, but the experiments will take place between Levels 1 and 2. They will work in Visual Question Answering, which are agents that answer natural language questions about visual content, and other areas of maturity that may reach the product level in five or more years.
Batra has served as an assistant professor at Georgia Tech since Fall 2016. Visit his website for more information about his research.
Samira Samadi Researches Theory that Can Help Everyone
When Samira Samadi was in her third year of college, she took a class on theory of computation where she learned about the Turing machine. The Church-Turing thesis, named after two renowned mathematicians, states that a simple abstract machine can determine any algorithmically solvable problem. The class was life-changing for the Sharif University of Technology mathematics student.
“It was super cool that such a simple structure can describe any algorithm or computation that a computer or a human could do,” she said. “It was a window for me that what I study could go far beyond the abstract. I could do great things with it.”
After the class, Samadi shifted her focus to theoretical computer science. Now a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science, she has made it her mission to apply fundamental ideas in theoretical CS to practical problems, such as an easy way to generate secure passwords.
Breaking the theory down so it’s simple for anyone to understand and benefit from has always been how Samadi approached problems.
“When I start thinking about a problem, I have to first get rid of a lot of conditions and transform it into a basic question, and that is the point when I can think creatively and connect the problem to different concepts,” she said. “That is when the motivation and the excitement sparks, thinking that what I’m doing could be used by another person or in an influential application.”
Improving Fairness
One of those connecting points is the growing field of fairness in machine learning (ML). As more products and services use ML for everything from home loans to self-driving cars, ethical issues can arise because much of the data models are trained on is historical and subject to bias.
Many researchers believe bias is the model or data’s fault, but it can often start as early as the data processing step, as Samadi has been researching. Last year, she offered a solution to remove bias from one of the first steps in the ML pipeline, principal component analysis. Her work reduced bias in low-dimensional representations of large datasets. This year, she tackled models to ensure group data was fairly represented.
Fairness is a burgeoning field, which enables Samadi to pick the problems that most interest her, but she also has a more personal motivation for this research as a woman in computer science.
“In fifth grade, I was the only girl competing for math olympiad in our state,” she said. “That was probably the first time I felt I would be in the minority if I continued in this field.”
The experience has impacted how she views gender ever since.
“No matter how confident one is, working in a male-dominated environment can negatively affect a woman’s perception of her abilities,” she said. “If I was in a more diverse environment or if I had seen more women in my field, this harm could be prevented, so I want to really grab this opportunity now that people care about fairness, diversity, and discrimination.”
OMSCS Dominates at Learning @ Scale
The Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) is leading the future of higher education online. The program’s prominence was evident at this June’s Learning @ Scale (L@S), an annual Association for Computing Machinery conference focusing on the digital learning environment.
OMSCS had influence in all areas of the conference, from leadership to research. OMSCS Associate Director of Student Experience David Joyner served as general chair for this year’s conference. Yet he wasn’t the only OMSCS connection in the conferences’ leadership. OMSCS alumnus and current teaching assistant (TA) Tony Mason was registration chair, and OMSCS student and TA Michael Swenson served as communications chair.
OMSCS is a great fit for L@S, according to Joyner.
“Learning @ Scale puts an emphasis not just on using technology in the act of teaching, but also on using technology to scale the overall enterprise of learning,” Joyner said. “So much of scaling OMSCS has been not to scaling instruction itself, but scaling the things that have to happen for instruction to take place, like admissions and advising. Learning @ Scale has been a great place to explore the problem holistically.”
Joyner and John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing Charles Isbell presented Master’s at Scale: Five Years in a Scalable Online Graduate Degree. The paper looks at the program from a bird’s eye view, showing how the degree has diversified computing.
“My favorite trend is that our fraction of women in the program has doubled since its inception, and our fraction of underrepresented minorities has cruised at double the on-campus rate,” Joyner said. “Online education has a mixed track record with underrepresented groups, but we're seeing evidence that it can be a powerful positive force.”
GT Computing researchers also presented four posters on in-progress research:

Next year L@S will be held in Atlanta and chaired by Joyner.
Machine Learning Makes Memory Management More Efficient
As big data becomes more critical to society, computer scientists are searching for ways to make it run more efficiently. Georgia Tech researchers are finding solutions to this challenge by using machine learning (ML) to make data storage and access easier.
Kleio is a hybrid memory management system that uses ML and more common historical methods to predict which data is most frequently accessed. The tool is 80 percent more effective than prior methods and shows the potential for applying ML to systems research.
Mixing Memories
There are two popular memory types: the efficient yet expensive dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and the more affordable but slower non-volatile memory. Researchers often combine their benefits by merging DRAM and non-volatile into one system commonly referred to as heterogeneous memory.
A heterogeneous memory system may be inefficient and must be used strategically to get maximum benefit.
“There is a difference in access speed, so we need to be clever on where we place the data,” said Thaleia Dimitra Doudali, a fifth-year School of Computer Science (SCS) Ph.D. student.
Most computer scientists put frequently accessed data, or hot data, in DRAM and the remaining in non-volatile. Hot data is typically determined by which data is historically accessed most, but this can lead to faulty predictions.
ML and Memory
The researchers knew using ML for systems problems like this was becoming a more popular solution and thought it could apply to memory management. They determined deep recurrent neural networks (RNN) were the best ML option because they use as input a sequence of data to make a prediction.
“Recurrent neural networks fit perfectly because given past access information, they can predict future access patterns,” Doudali said.
The challenge came in determining which part of the memory access process to predict. The researchers wanted ML prediction for every piece of data. Yet they also needed the system to be practical and scalable.
To achieve both, they created Kleio, a hybrid memory management system that combines ML and historical methods in order to predict the data access frequency and efficiently manage data across the memory components.
Given the available system resources, Kleio prioritizes ML training for data that can increase application performance if placed in the right order. Periodically, Kleio combines the historical and ML access pattern predictions to identify hot data in real-time and migrate them in DRAM. In this way, Kleio can deliver on average 80 percent of the feasible application performance improvements.
“We showed that the use of ML in memory management is very promising,” Doudali said. “Its accuracy can bridge the performance gap between existing and oracular solutions.”
Doudali presented the work at the eighth International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing in Phoenix, Arizona, in June. The paper, Kleio: A Hybrid Memory Page Scheduler with Machine Intelligence, was honored as a best paper finalist. Doudali co-wrote it with SCS Associate Professor Ada Gavrilovska and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. researchers Sergey Blagodurov, Abhinav Vishnu, and Sudhanva Gurumurthi.
MLsploit Tackles Machine Learning Security with a Cloud-based Platform
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are pervasive in our daily lives and are the basis for everything from suggestions on streaming platforms to fraud detection services, yet recent research has found that they are highly vulnerable to attacks. These attacks come in many forms, including bypassing Android and Linux malware detection, and attacking deep learning models for image misclassification and objection detection.
To patch these vulnerabilities and increase security for safety-critical applications, researchers at Georgia Tech and Intel have teamed up to create MLsploit. It is the first user-friendly, cloud-based framework that enables researchers and developers to rapidly evaluate and compare state-of-the-art adversarial attacks and defenses for ML models.
What Does MLsploit Do?
MLsploit’s web interface is open-source and allows researchers to quickly perform experiments on attack and defense algorithms by easily adjusting their parameters. Once tests are finished, the user may store the results in the framework to serve as a growing database for future adversarial ML research to build on.
“MLsploit is unique in that it is a collection and repository in the specific space of adversarial ML,” said School of Computational Science and Engineering Ph.D. student Nilaksh Das, a primary student investigator of the project.
MLsploit researchers built the tool as the springboard for students and researchers in adversarial ML, deep learning practitioners in industry who want to perform in-depth experimentation on a new model before rolling it out for private or public use.
“Ultimately, our goal is for MLsploit to become a collection of all the literature in the adversarial ML space,” he said.
How Does MLsploit Work?
MLsploit was built to be modular so that users can easily integrate their own work into the framework.
MLsploit provides the user the web-user interface and the back-end computation engine. Then, the user can upload their own modules or functions. Once these are created, they can be used in conjunction with the whole MLsploit framework.
The tool was developed at the Intel® Science & Technology Center for Adversary-Resilient Security Analytics (ISTC-ARSA) housed at Tech. The center specializes in identifying vulnerabilities of ML algorithms and developing new security approaches to improve the resilience of ML applications.The project represents a culmination of the last three years of research in the center.
MLsploit was first presented at Black Hat Asia 2019 and will be presented again as a Project Showcase at the 25th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.
An extended abstract and complete listing of co-authors for the paper can be found here.
Data Mining Experts Showcase Research at KDD 2019
Data mining allows us to extract meaningful insights from raw data, enabling us to make more informed decisions in many areas of our lives.

Civic Data Science Pairs with Smart Cities for Sixth Summer
Students presented data science solutions for problems like climate change and traffic at the Civic Data Science (CDS) finale on July 28. This was the first year the National Science Foundation–funded summer program partnered with the Georgia Smart Communities Challenge.
Since 2013, undergraduates from colleges across the country come to campus for the 10-week program, where they learn how to use data science to tackle civic problems. This year, CDS paired with Smart Cities’ Smart Communities, an initiative that integrates technology-based research with a community’s goals.
This year’s CDS projects were:
- Smart Sea Level Tools for Emergency Planning and Response, in which students found a better way to conduct maintenance for 30 smart sea level sensors that are part of a program run by School of Computer Science and Institute for People and Technology Senior Research Scientist Russell Clark in Savannah, Georgia.
- Albany Housing Data Initiative, where students cleaned city data from disparate sources and created a database to help the city of Albany, Georgia, understanding the effect of programs to reduce energy costs.
- Connected Vehicle Technology Master Plan, in which students analyzed data to better handle the flow of traffic in Gwinnett county for emergency vehicles.
The program’s co-director and SCS Professor Ellen Zegura believes students connected to these projects more because of their real-world application.
“It’s a pleasure to watch the work progress from the early first days to getting to see how much you all have learned and how much you all understand the context of the projects you’re doing,” she said during the finale ceremony held in the Technology Square Research Building.
“It’s not just that you built a database, but here’s what a sensor looks like and here’s how it can go wrong.”
The students agree. Angela Lau, a rising sophomore at Cornell Unviersity, wanted an internship that coud help the community.
“I was really interested in this program because of the local applicability of the projects,” she said. “It surprised me how real it was and how we could help a community over a few weeks.”
Working with real data also presented unique learning experiences that students wouldn’t normally encounter in a classroom setting.
“There were a lot of challenges working with a real data,” said Kutub Gandhi, a rising senior at Rice University. “Our entire project was figuring out what was wrong with the data collected from sea level sensors.”
For many students, this was their first time learning data science skills that they can now use throughout their career.
“I had heard of data visualization but didn’t know much about it,” said David Li, a rising senior at Stony Brook University. “But by the end I realized, ‘Wow I learned this and I never knew I could do this before!’”
'MacGyver'-like Robot Can Build Own Tools By Assessing Form, Function of Supplies
Thanks to new technology that enables them to create simple tools, robots may be on the verge of their own version of the Stone Age.
Using a novel capability to reason about shape, function, and attachment of unrelated parts, researchers have for the first time successfully trained an intelligent agent to create basic tools by combining objects.
The breakthrough comes from Georgia Tech’s Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning (RAIL) research lab and is a significant step toward enabling intelligent agents to devise more advanced tools that could prove useful in hazardous – and potentially life-threatening – environments.
The concept may sound familiar. It’s called “MacGyvering,” based off the name of a 1980s — and recently rebooted — television series. In the series, the title character is known for his unconventional problem-solving ability using differing resources available to him.
For years, computer scientists and others have been working to provide robots with similar capabilities. In their new robot-MacGyvering work, RAIL lab researchers led by Associate Professor Sonia Chernova used as a starting point a robotics technique previously developed by former Georgia Tech Professor Mike Stilman.
In this latest work, a robot trained using the team’s novel approach is given a set of optional parts and told to make a specific tool. Much like its human counterparts, the robot first examines the shapes of each part and how one might be attached to another.
Using machine learning, the robot is trained to match form to function – which object shapes facilitate a particular outcome – from numerous examples of everyday objects. For example, by learning that the concavity of bowls enables them to hold liquids, it makes use of this knowledge when constructing a spoon. Similarly, the robots were taught how to attach objects together from examples of materials that could be pierced or grasped.
In the study, researchers successfully created hammers, spatulas, scoops, squeegees, and screwdrivers.
“The screwdriver was particularly interesting because the robot combined pliers and a coin,” said Lakshmi Nair, a Ph.D. student in the School of Interactive Computing and one of the researchers on the project. “It reasoned that the pliers were able to grasp something and said that the coin sort of matched the head of a screwdriver. Put them together, and it creates an effective tool.”
Currently, the robot is limited only to the shape and attachment. It cannot yet effectively reason about particular material properties, a crucial step in advancing to a real-world scenario.

“People reason that hammers are sturdy and strong, so you wouldn’t make a hammer out of foam blocks,” Nair said. “We want to reach that level of reasoning in our work, which is something we’re working on now.”
The inspiration for the work comes from the popular story of Apollo 13, the doomed seventh crewed flight of the Apollo space program. After an oxygen tank in the ship’s service module exploded two days into the mission, crew members were forced to make makeshift modifications to the carbon dioxide removal system.
Despite a dangerously tight window of time and extremely high tension among all aboard and at mission control, the rescue proved successful. Nair and collaborators hope this research will prove foundational to future robotics technology that could reason faster and without the burden of stress.
“They were able to make this filter, but the solution took a long time to come up with,” Nair said. “We want to make robots that can assist humans in these kinds of scenarios to take the pressure off of them to come up with innovative solutions and potentially save their lives.”
This work was presented at the 2019 Robotics: Science and Systems conference in a paper titled Autonomous Tool Construction Using Part Shape and Attachment Prediction (Lakshmi Nair, Nithin Shrivatsav, Zackory Erickson, Sonia Chernova). It is sponsored in part by grants from the National Science Foundation an the Office of Naval Research.
Students Now Have Opportunity for Hands-on Supercomputing Experience
Students have one more compelling reason to study computing at Georgia Tech: they now have access to work on a state-of-the-art supercomputer.
The NVIDIA DGX-1 supercomputer is a specialty graphics processing unit (GPU)-based platform designed to facilitate faster and more efficient big data sequencing, machine learning (ML), and deep learning processes.
“There aren’t many computers or servers significant enough to be recognizable by model name. But, a DGX-1 is well-known throughout the computing community, particularly by the artificial intelligence and machine learning crowd,” said School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Research Technologist Will Powell.
Although the DGX-1 is a well-known system, these high-profile computers are not normally accessible to the broader computational science community because of their cost, which is why this opportunity is unique for Georgia Tech students.
CSE won funding for the DGX-1 as part of a bid approved in this fiscal year’s campus Technology Fee Funding. This institute-level program is orchestrated by a committee comprised of faculty, staff, and students that review proposals from across campus to purchase various technologies for instruction and learning.
“CSE strives to cultivate a diverse computing environment with ground-breaking technologies, such as the DGX-1. Providing students with the opportunity to use and study best-in-class, forward-thinking architectures allows us to further pioneer new computational methods,” said Powell.
The DGX-1 will become available for the Fall 2019 semester in the data and visual analytics classes (CX4242 and CSE6242) taught by Lecturer Mahdi Roozbahani and Associate Professor Polo Chau. Students in these classes will use this platform to accelerate computational analysis performed on large-scale real-world datasets.
“This is a great opportunity for students to have access to a high performance platform designed for artificial intelligence, ML, deep learning, and analytics,” said Joint CSE and NVIDIA Senior Graph Software Engineer Oded Green, whose research focuses on improving the performance and scalability of large-scale graph analytics using platforms such as the DGX-1.
Watch the DGX-1 unboxing video below:
The DGX-1 is powered by 8 NVIDIA TESLA V100 GPUs, has over 40,000 CUDA Cores, 5,000 Tensor cores, and 1,000 TFLOPS built specially for deep learning.
And while the DGX-1 arriving at Georgia Tech for student-use is exciting enough, there is cause for more celebration as a DGX Station also arrived this year as part of the new NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab (NVAIL) grant awarded to CSE.
The NVAIL grant focuses on developing multi-GPU graph analytics and the DGX station is constructed specifically for data science and artificial intelligence development. The station will be used for graduate students and researchers associated with the NVAIL.

Undergrad MOOC Makes Top 100 List
Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS)’s courses already lead the field of online education, and now the College of Computing’s undergraduate offerings are receiving accolades. Online education review site Class Central named an undergraduate massive open online course (MOOC) as one of the top 100 MOOCs ever.
Python programming class CS1301xI (the first mini-course in the divided CS1301 MOOC series) is now one of Class Central’s highest-rated MOOCs of all time with more than 30 five-star reviews. Students praise the course for its strong explanations, interactive learning, and accessibility to beginning programmers.
Since 2017, more than 83,000 students have taken the full programming course. OMSCS Associate Director of Student Experience David Joyner, who created and teaches the course, thinks it shows the desire for MOOCs that compare to courses for credit.
“There is an appreciation and thirst for MOOCs that really capture the full depth and breadth of what students could learn on campus,” he said. “There’s always been a question about whether students even want the depth of an on-campus class in their MOOCs. I think this shows that they do."
Stella Biderman Builds Community Through OMSCS
Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) student Stella Biderman has always used computer science to foster community.
As an avid theory researcher both personally and professionally, she loves exchanging ideas and making room for different ones. It’s also something she does as an advocate for transgender and other LGBTQ+ people in tech. Biderman has found a home for all of it since she joined OMSCS in 2017.
Discovering Computer Science
Biderman has always loved theoretical computer science problems she can fit in her head.
“I don’t like not thinking,” she said. “I much prefer figuring out how to build the model more than actually building it.”
She discovered her love for research in fifth grade when her school in Fairfax, Virginia, joined the FIRST Robotics Competition, a national science competition for students from elementary to high school. After that experience, Biderman wanted to be a roboticist. A few years later, though, she became passionate about math when she attended a math summer camp at Boston University that taught everything from elementary number theory to how to use computers for mathematical experiments.
When she went to college at the University of Chicago, she realized computer science would let her do both. She double majored in mathematics and philosophy but wanted more of a challenge and found herself in a graduate-level algorithms course as a sophomore.
“It combined all of the coolest part of theoretical math with applications to CS, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI),” she said. “It felt like my whole life was coming together.”
College was also the time she started to explore her gender identity. Ever the researcher, Biderman took a very scientific approach.
“I asked my friend, ‘Can you call me Stella and refer to me with she pronouns?’” she said. “I wanted to experiment with how I dressed and presented myself. Gender is a complicated and messy thing, and I wanted to see what felt best.”
Researching in the Real World
Although she loved the research in college, she was looking for a job that could combine her interests in a real-world environment and let her bring her full identity to work. She found it at Booz Allen Hamilton, where government agencies come when they want to add data science and analytics to their work. Currently her team uses reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique, to predict how foreign powers might act in conflict.
“Using game theory to describe how countries negotiate has always been popular in international relations,” Biderman said. “My work asks what if we applied some heavy-duty computer science techniques to this in a different way.”
Booz Allen Hamilton is also an inclusive workplace where Biderman regularly participates in mixers for LGBTQ+ employees in the company and helps with resume review workshops for queer college students.
Building Knowledge with OMSCS
Yet, as Biderman got deeper into her research, the job became less about theoretical CS and more applied AI. Biderman thought OMSCS could help her fill the knowledge gap on areas like databases and operating systems while still working at the job she loved.
“A lot of things in CS don’t have to do with algorithms, and I didn’t really know anything,” she said. “I wanted to get a deeper knowledge of AI, too.”
Finding Community
OMSCS has also given her the opportunity to pursue research outside of work. In April, she released a paper on the computational complexity of the game Magic: The Gathering. Magic: The Gathering is Turing Complete, co-written with Alex Churchill and Austin Herrick, determined that Magic was ultimately unsolvable by an algorithm. The result generated a lot of buzz in the gaming and theory communities, becoming Arxiv’s most tweeted paper in April and receiving press.
Biderman is a passionate researcher, but she also appreciates the collaboration. She is a member of Lucy Labs, an OMSCS digital lab for online education research.
“Participating in online forums where people teach, learn, and present research has always been important to me, and something I value about OMSCS is there is a community of people talking about stuff I love,” she said.
It’s also important for Biderman to give back. She has been a teaching assistant for the AI Robotics course for this reason, and she is also a transgender rights advocate. Last December, Biderman gave a speech on transgender rights before the general assembly of the Organization of American States to illuminate the transgender experience.
“My name is Stella Rose Biderman,” she began her speech. “I'm a mathematician, a computer scientist, and a philosopher. I am a researcher who works here in D.C. to create new forms of AI and technologies that will improve the world in the future...In many ways I'm not like my colleagues, when I take the metro to the office I am regularly vigilant to people who might harm or attack me.”
Biderman works to bring visibility to transgender people in tech. In fact, she successfully pushed for Booz Allen Hamilton to sign the Transgender Business Statement for Equality and has been working with company leadership to create opportunities for other transgender employees. She was recently recognized for her work at the DC FemTech Awards, which honor women and non-binary people in DC tech organizations.
For students like Biderman, community is not just something to join, but to build and shape for the better.
Researchers Use Social Media to Help Measure Outcomes of Psychiatric Medication
Social media posts are becoming a vital tool to assessing the effects of psychiatric medication, according to a new study from researchers in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing (IC). The approach offers clinicians a more effective method to measure mental health outcomes in a notoriously imprecise space.
In treating mental illness, clinicians are often forced into a trial-and-error approach to prescribing medication to patients. Each patient may react differently – oftentimes with negative outcomes – to drugs that have been matched with conditions based on incomplete and potentially biased data from clinical trials.
“In most non-mental health treatment where particular symptoms like a fever or chronic pain might indicate a specific physical condition, there exists a more definitive matching approach to prescription,” said Koustuv Saha, an IC Ph.D. student who led the study. “In psychiatric care, that matching approach is unknown.”
Patients taking the wrong medication could experience increased depression or anxiety, suicidal ideation, or other symptoms like fluctuations in sleep and weight. In many cases, they are forced to return to their clinician for a change in medication or, in worse cases, may lose trust in the medication entirely and stop using it.
“Considering that five of the top 50 drugs sold in the United States are psychiatric medications, it’s extremely important to understand how they actually work on individuals,” Saha said.
In the past, clinical trials have taken a disease-centered approach that attempts to prescribe specific medications with psychiatric symptoms, neglecting those psychoactive effects of the drug. Trials are conducted for smaller cohorts over shorter periods of time, eliminate some individuals who experience more extreme symptoms, and are often biased, being conducted by the drug companies themselves.
Adopting a “patient-centered” model that considers individual outcomes for patients using a specific medication, this study leveraged longitudinal and large-scale social media data to achieve a form of digital-based matching of patients to medications.
The researchers collected a list of medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration, then collected Tweets that mentioned these medications between 2015-16. From that, they collected over 600,000 Tweets that identified users of a specific medication. Interestingly enough, their data matched the top four prescription psychiatric medications in that period: Sertraline (Zoloft), Escitalopram (Lexapro), Fluoxetine (Prozac), and Duloxetine (Cymbalta).
Using a control group of random Twitter users that did not take the medication and building on prior work that showed the ability for language found in social posts to predict mental health conditions, researchers could match specific medications with their outcomes, positive or negative, after use.
The findings indicated that Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (Sertraline, Escitalopram, Fluoxetine) – three of the most popular prescription medications – are actually associated with worsening symptoms. Tricyclic Antidepressants like Dosulepin, Imipramine, and Clomipramine, by comparison, were more associated with improving conditions.
“Clinically, our findings reveal signals of the most common effects of the psychiatric medications over a large population, with the potential for improved characterization of their occurrence,” Saha writes in the paper. “Technologically, we show the potential of novel technologies in digital therapeutics.”
This research, Saha said, exists as a proof of concept to show levels of a specific condition – before and after medication use – using digital data. He stressed it is not a replacement for clinical care, only a way to help augment treatment using additional available data.
The work was presented at the 13th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media in a paper titled A Social Media Study on the Effects of Psychiatric Medication Use (Koustuv Saha, Benjamin Sugar, John Torous, Bruno Abrahao, Emre Kiciman, Munmun De Choudhury). It was awarded Outstanding Study Design Paper at the conference. It is funded in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health.
New Mining Techniques Effortlessly Provide Greater Insight for Unstructured Text Data
The ability to effectively and efficiently harness unstructured data is the proverbial race to the moon for the data mining research world.
Unstructured data is information that is typically text-heavy and does not have a predefined model or is not organized in a predefined manner. It can represent the name of a disease, the location of a sale, a type of product sold, and much more. According to some estimates, it also accounts for roughly 85 percent of the data in the world.
However, acquiring useful insights from massive unstructured text data remains a challenge that was not readily addressed by existing mining techniques.
Now, a recently published Ph.D. defense combining two algorithms specializing in neural text classification and taxonomy construction, claims to do just that.
According to the defense, when these algorithms are used together, they create an elegant data mining pipeline that can effortlessly turn text data into useful insights. The algorithms allow for multi-dimensional analysis of unstructured text data using an integrated structuring-and-mining framework and discover multi-granular structures from the text.
School of Computational Science and Engineering Assistant Professor Chao Zhang developed the new techniques while studying under the direction of famed computer scientist Jiawei Han.The work has garnered so much recognition that it won the 2019 SIGKDD Runner Up Dissertation Award.
“As one of the most important data forms, unstructured text data plays a crucial role in data-driven decision making in domains ranging from social networking and information retrieval to healthcare and scientific research,” said Zhang.
“In many emerging applications, people's information needs from text data are becoming multi-dimensional – they demand useful insights for multiple aspects from the given body of a text.”
Zhang’s two-part pipeline addresses this multi-dimensional need while also tackling one of the biggest bottlenecks of mining unstructured text data: labeling. Labeled data represents a set of samples that have been tagged with one or more labels and is used in a form of machine learning called supervised learning.
Unfortunately, this is not always the practical approach for our world as data is often unlabeled and labeling a sufficient amount for training supervised models is often too expensive.
Therefore, an elegant data mining algorithm has to be able to discover latent structures from unstructured text data, or, be able to sort unstructured data into multiple categories without extensive labeling.This is where Zhang’s methods, which require no or very little labeling effort, truly shine.
“The algorithms for multidimensional text analysis require little supervision, making this framework appealing for many applications where labeled data are expensive to obtain,” he said.
Ultimately, while being more effective than other models, this proposed framework has two distinctive advantages: flexibility and label efficiency. Both of which, drive costs down dramatically.

Startup Connects Job Seekers with Autism to New Opportunities
Applying for jobs can be one of the biggest challenges for people with autism. Disclosing autism to an employer is difficult, but sometimes even the interview is daunting. But a new app called Mentra could make the process a lot easier.
Mentra pairs autistic people with students not on the spectrum to help them navigate the job hunt. Once the algorithm matches a team, they can meet and develop a mentorship together.
“The goal of Mentra is to help autistic individuals find meaningful employment, and for mentors to cultivate a friendship with someone who might have a different perspective,” said fourth-year computational media student Jhillika Kumar, the founder of AxisAbility, the startup behind the app.
Finding Technology for Autism
For Kumar, the work has a personal connection: Her older brother, Vikram, has nonverbal autism. She noticed that when Vikram got an iPad when they were kids, everything changed for him.
“It was so intuitive and allowed him to meaningfully and independently interact with the world,” she said. “I realized this is a form of using technology to empower people in a different way than we think.”
Vikram’s use of the iPad got Kumar interested in user interaction design. She was attracted to Georgia Tech because of its unique computational media degree that combines design and computer science.
“One thing this degree really taught me is that we need to work side-by-side with our users so we’re not just designing what’s in our heads, but we’re actually getting feedback at every point,” Kumar said.
Researching Autism and Technology
Vikram’s experience with the iPad was direct feedback, but there isn’t any quantifiable research right now on why using technology to communicate works so well for many people with autism. Kumar’s desire to prove this that treatment was effective lead her to working with Regents’ Professor Gregory Abowd in the School of Interactive Computing.
Abowd spearheaded Tech’s presence in the autism and technology research field after he noticed he could start to see his son presenting signs of autism in a family home video before he even got diagnosed. In the years since, this initial observation has led a network of researchers and labs to study all aspects of autism and technology, such as mapping behaviors to diagnose the disability.

When Kumar met Abowd, though, he told her one of the main problems people with autism face isn’t a lack of technology, but that there aren’t enough people willing to help. Kumar decided her role would be to connect the people to the technology she saw change her brother’s life.
Launching AxisAbility
She launched the startup AxisAbility in 2019 to empower people with autism to enter the workforce. The team includes three other Tech students: Conner Reinhardt, Rishma Mendhekar, and Ricky Yu. They are launching the Mentra app in partnership with GT Bits of Good as their first initiative.
Kumar has been awarded the Student of Vision Abie Award from women in computing conference Grace Hopper for her work. She will speak at the upcoming conference on Thursday, October 3, from 2:15 to 3:15 p.m., in room OCCC W300.
Machine Learning Fuels Campus Romance
The old adage about there being a lot of fish in the sea is certainly true at Georgia Tech. But, with more than 30,000 students enrolled, it can be a challenge to find the right fish for you.
Taking this challenge for action, The Agency, Georgia Tech’s student machine learning club, jumped into the online dating pool earlier this year with the launch of Love Machine (Learning). LM(L) is a matchmaking survey to help connect Georgia Tech students with their ideal partner.
Inspired by her studies in a social psychology course, fourth-year computer science major Valentine Wilson initially brought the idea to a club meeting in fall 2018.
“In class we learned about four key relationship indicators. The researcher was able to quantify what makes a relationship fail, so we decided to find out if we could quantify what makes a relationship succeed,” said Wilson.
Finding Love in a ‘Swipe Right’ Culture
While ideas like this exist at Stanford University and Harvard University, Georgia Tech wanted to put their own spin on campus matchmaking.
The club crafted a 32-question survey that asks students a variety of questions about their demographics, personality, and interests. For the survey, the team looked at questions from online matchmaking sites like Match.com and debated about which questions their survey should ask. Though the LM(L) questions are written in a joking manner, Wilson explained that the team spent a great deal of time thinking about what the answers might mean for finding someone’s soulmate.
“We debated a lot about questions like, ‘is it important to you to date someone of the same ethnicity as you?’ or ‘how important is it that your partner is of the same political party as you?,’” said Wilson, who was one of 24 students that worked on the project.
Once collected, the survey results were analyzed using an unsupervised machine-learning method and a genetic algorithm that is inspired by natural selection and genetic crossover.
E-Love Note Delivered
The LM(L) survey was promoted last spring through posters, emails, fraternity and sorority GroupMe’s, and the @GTStudents Twitter handle. While the project was first intended to be a joke, and a fun first project for novice machine learning students, more than 780 undergraduate and graduate students filled out the survey.
Students completing the survey received their match the week before finals last May – a time frame Wilson says they will work to avoid in the future – and love was in the air from there.
Matches included only the ideal partner’s email address. Names and photos were excluded from the survey to prevent bias and students felt like their peers would be more honest if their identities were initially kept anonymous.
The club says they are looking into adding social media handles, photos, and a short bio into next year’s iteration. They’re also considering alternatives to email for delivering matches.
To date, The Agency has record of one couple that is still dating as a result of the survey. There might be more happy couples, but the club did not issue a follow-up survey to evaluate their success. Wilson stumbled upon the lovebirds via the Georgia Tech Reddit feed.
The couple, which wants to remain anonymous, admits that they may have met sometime in the next three years, but it was unlikely, and that it would have taken them a lot longer to start dating had it not been for the survey.
When asked about her perspective on love after conducting this research, Wilson said, “I don’t necessarily think that there is ‘The One’, but there are many people who are good for you in different ways. That’s what I saw from the data, though I’m not sure I should base my opinion on love from data even though that is a very Georgia Tech thing to do!"
The club aims to distribute the survey again in Spring 2020.

MURI Launches at Georgia Tech
A single ant can’t accomplish much, but an entire colony can gather food, build nests, and protect the queen. When powerless individuals can accomplish powerful goals together, it’s called collective emergent behavior, and it’s something researchers in physics, robotics, and computer science are trying to understand better.
Harnessing collective emergent behavior could lead to exciting new initiatives in computing. More than 40 researchers gathered at Georgia Tech’s CODA building on August 22 to discuss these possibilities at the kick-off for a $6.25 million Department of Defense’s Multidisciplinary University Research Initiatives (MURI) grant to study the phenomena over a five-year period.
ADVANCE Professor in Computing Dana Randall (pictured at right) leads a diverse team, including mechanical and chemical engineering, physics, and computational science professors from Georgia Tech and three other universities.
The team also includes Dunn Family Professor in the School of Physics Daniel Goldman, Arizona State computational science and engineering Professor Andrea Richa, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) chemical engineering Professor Michael Strano, MIT physics Associate Professor Jeremy England, and Northwestern mechanical engineering Professor Todd Murphey.
“This really is the most exceptional group I’ve ever collaborated with, and collectively we’re trying to do something even greater than we’d do individually—true to the theme of MURI,” said Randall, who is also a professor in the School of Computer Science and co-executive director of the Institute for Data Engineering and Science.
The Possibilities of Emergent Behavior
Emergent behavior is when microscopic changes can impact an entire system, like in an ant colony or robotic swarm. Although this has been observed in physics and computation, there has been no formal theoretical framework to explain how it functions until this work. The researchers will use basic algorithms on simple machines to perform complex tasks to predict and design emergent behaviors within computation.
[RELATED: Research and Collaboration Thrive @ GT Computing]
“This MURI brings together Georgia Tech’s main areas of strength and expertise,” said Executive Vice President for Research Chaouki Abdallah. “The partnership with other universities makes it really exciting. Hopefully we will solve some of these problems.”
The MURI’s Goals
Throughout the day, researchers explained their respective plans to tackle each of MURI’s three aims:
· identifying and predicting emergent computation
· actively evolving systems
· determining optimal design and control
According to Richa, the first step is one of discovery.
“From a local distributed algorithm point of view, it’s very difficult,” said Richa. “For example, it’s easy to introduce phase transitions globally, but the challenge lies in handling multiple concurrent waves of transition in the system.”
To do this, researchers must discover which experimental and theoretical characteristics create emergent computation. Then they must determine how to model system capabilities, find language for describing what is possible, and learn how things can be designed to perform certain tasks.
Once the systems are understood, researchers work to use them to perform directed initiatives. These include efficient computation, finding equivalences between computation and physical properties, and employing fluctuation reduction as a design principle for cultivating active matter.
Goldman will explore this through his "smarticles,’’ a collective of simply computed robots.
“We’re discovering how to make a task-specific robot made of non-specific task incapable robots,” he said.
The third aim intends to predictably manipulate the behavior by finding optimization-based principles to design and control emergent computation systems.
This portion of the project is about discovering limitations and possibilities to achieve collective emergent behavior of an ensemble. This includes determining metrics for emergence and physical constraints that limit the system, and exploiting the system to solve prohibitively complicated computations.
“Part of the excitement is not knowing what might be next,” Randall said.
Grad Student Finalist in National Collegiate Inventors Competition
A project that grew out of personal experience with one of the trickiest parts of military medical airlifts is now among the 10 finalists in the Collegiate Inventors Competition (CIC) organized by the National Inventors Hall of Fame (NIHF).
College of Computing alumnus and current computer science master’s student Mahdi Al-Husseini has developed a tool that improves safety during helicopter rescue operations.
Working with his first-year Tech roommates Joshua Barnett and Anthony Chen, Al-Husseini has produced a prototype stabilization system for helicopter hoist operations — the rescue or medical evacuation procedures that usually happen under the worst of circumstances.
“Patients often must be evacuated over water, above sloping terrain, and in hostile territory,” said Al-Husseini, now a U.S. Army officer and helicopter pilot who flies medical evacuation missions.
“Helicopter hoist operations are some of the most dangerous work Army aviation crews perform.”
Usually, aircrews must lower a stretcher-like basket called a litter to carry a patient. Then the patient is lifted through the air to the helicopter cabin. But it’s no simple task.
“The rotor blades of a hovering helicopter force a turbulent downwind deflection of air known as downwash. Downwash, in conjunction with low-wind conditions and poor helicopter control, can cause a hoisted load to rotate quickly — up to several full revolutions per second.
“In addition to psychological trauma and disorientation, uncontrolled spin like that can result in physical injury or even death,” Al-Husseini said.
The team’s solution is the Stabilizing Aerial Loads Utility System, or SALUS (pronounced SAL-us, and derived from the Latin word for safety). It’s a reaction-wheel stabilizer that stops the litter from spinning out of control. The team is close to signing a research and development agreement with the military for a battery of tests, including testing on a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter.
The team has been working from opposite sides of the continent since they all finished their bachelor’s degrees at Georgia Tech in 2018. Barnett and Chen are pursuing doctorates at Stanford University while Al-Husseini, who also earned bachelor’s degrees in biomedical engineering and public policy, works full-time in the Army and is finishing his master’s degree in Atlanta. Despite the physical distance, they have developed a proof of concept and five ever-more-advanced prototypes in a year.
“We developed SALUS to allow hoist operators to focus their efforts on the already risky process of extracting a patient,” Al-Husseini said.
“Soldiers complete their missions with valor knowing that, should they be wounded, medical evacuation crews will expedite their treatment and facilitate their return home. SALUS seeks to support those efforts as seamlessly as possible.”
The SALUS team is presenting its proof of concept to a panel of NIHF inductees and officials from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The event is set for October 30 at USPTO headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia.
Along with SALUS, one other Georgia Tech invention, SecURO, is among the 10 CIC finalists this year.

Researchers Set to Receive Two Innovation Awards at HPEC’19
Defined by the practice of aggregating power in an effort to achieve greater performance, high-performance computing (HPC) is increasingly becoming more diverse. Now, this market, which is expected to reach $59.65 billion by 2025, is setting its sights on new applications including the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) for deep learning, cloud computing, and more.
These applications will ultimately speed processing rates and cut computational costs for embedded computing systems used in transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and a host of other industries.
But, there are specific requirements and unique challenges – known and unknown – to deploying HPC applications outside of a data center. To address these challenges and advance this growing research area, School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) HPC researchers are bringing their expertise to this week’s 2019 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC).
HPEC is one of the leading conferences of its kind. It brings HPC and embedded systems researchers together to identify obstacles and develop effective solutions for delivering HPC capabilities to edge computing applications, augment big data with GPUs, and more.
Researchers from CSE are set to present several papers at this year’s HPEC, which runs from Sept. 24 to 26 in Waltham, Massachusetts. Of these, two papers were submitted to the HPEC 2019 GraphChallenge and are set to receive Innovation Awards.
“The GraphChallenge creates an annual benchmark that drives community development of new solutions for analyzing graphs and sparse data from social media, sensor feeds, and scientific data to discover relationships between events,” said CSE Ph.D. student Abdurrahman Yasar, an investigator on two of the four Innovation Award winning papers, and a 2018 GraphChallenge champion.
One of the two CSE winning papers, Linear Algebra-Based Triangle Counting via Fine-Grained Tasking on Heterogeneous Environments, describes an update to the linear-algebraic formulation of the classic triangle-counting problem.
“Triangle counting is a representative graph analysis algorithm with several applications and is also one of the three benchmarks used in the IEEE HPEC GraphChallenge,” said Yasar.
“In this work we propose a novel multi-core multi-GPU triangle counting algorithm. Our new approach does not require architecture specific changes on code which is crucial for portability on heterogenous environments and the way we distribute the tasks between GPUs and CPUs is highly appreciated.”
While triangle counting remains an important benchmark in the GraphChallenge, several other research areas are also prevalent in this year’s CSE HPEC proceedings.
See the list below to view all Georgia Tech papers being presented at this year’s HPEC conference:
- Concurrent Katz Centrality for Streaming Graphs - Chunxing Yin, Jason Riedy
- Skip the Intersection: Quickly Counting Common Neighbors on Shared-Memory Systems – Xiaojing An, Kasimir Gabert, James Fox, Oded Green, David A. Bader
- Improving Scheduling for Irregular Applications with Logarithmic Radix Binning – James Fox, Alok Tripathy, Oded Green

Cleaning Up the Community: Shagun Jhaver Explores Impact of Content Moderation Practices on Social Media
Online communities like Reddit or Twitter act like town halls, where opinions are shared and everyone, in theory, has a voice. Only, it doesn’t always work like that. What was once optimistically viewed as a solution to public discourse, offering promises of open and logical discussions where anyone with a keyboard and an internet connection could speak their piece, has instead become a bit of a Wild West. Message boards have degraded into sources of harassment, misinformation, radicalization, and more.
Now, the largely techno-utopian view has been adjusted, and moderation of content has become the norm. The question is: how can you moderate, while also maintaining the promise of free speech? Also, how can you avoid discouraging posters whose content was moderated or removed while encouraging them to remain a part of the public discourse?
These are just a few of the questions being posed and pursued by Shagun Jhaver, a Ph.D. student in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing (IC), whose papers at the upcoming Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) conference provide some context and, perhaps, solutions.
Fairness, accountability, and transparency
Jhaver is a computer scientist at heart. He earned his bachelor’s degree in India in electrical engineering and then studied computer science for his master’s at the University of Texas at Dallas. Like most in IC, though, his primary focus is on humans.
“One of the main attractions to our School was that, although it is a computer science school, I am able to do interviews and surveys with people,” Jhaver explained. “What good are technological developments if they don’t work for humans, if they don’t improve society? In order to understand the interactions between technology and society, I wanted to develop a mixed-methods background, and the resources and faculty here are perfect for that.”
One of his first projects as a graduate student was investigating communication on social media around the Black Lives Matter movement.
“I wanted to understand the emergent collective participation around this movement and what people were feeling on the ground in the moment,” he said. “That’s how I entered this area of social computing.”
Social computing is an area of computer science that focuses on the intersection between social behavior and computational systems. Integral to Jhaver’s study was how social media and the data gathered within those systems reflected what was happening within society as a whole.
There may be no more adequate reflection of this phenomena than on Reddit and Twitter, two communities his research has looked at. At CSCW, he’ll present a handful of studies that have examined the topic of content moderation. One of the papers, titled Does Transparency in Moderation Really Matter?: User Behavior After Content Removal Explanations on Reddit, earned a best paper award. Another, titled Did You Suspect the Post Would be Removed?: Understanding User Reactions to Content Removals on Reddit, earned an honorable mention.
How, he wonders, do you develop good moderation practices that enforce community rules while also maintaining the free expression of ideas? And, what practices improve how posters feel about their moderated content and encourage them to continue participating in these forums?
“Content moderation is more nuanced than just editing and removing content,” Jhaver said. “It’s about the overall experience of the user and the community and how they interact.”
His research came to a few conclusions:
One, fairness matters; two, accountability is important; three, the platforms should be transparent in their decisions. From the perspective of end users, that means that rules are clear and easy to follow, and when the post is removed they are notified and given a clear explanation of why. If they appeal, they are given an appropriate response.
But there are multiple stakeholders involved in the exchange, and who determines what is fair?
“These Reddit moderators are volunteers,” Jhaver said. “Is it fair for us to expect them to take on these increased responsibilities for providing explanations?”
In other words, these issues are much more nuanced than they would seem to many casual participants. Amy Bruckman, a professor in IC and Jhaver’s co-advisor (with IC adjunct faculty Eric Gilbert), said she can’t think of other research that has examined this aspect of social communities.
“I don’t think it has been studied – okay, your content was just removed, so how do you feel about that?” she said. “Taking that other side of it is unique.”
Giving everyone a voice
So, why do these explanations even matter? Why not just remove bad content and move on?
“But free speech is interesting,” Jhaver said. “There’s this dichotomy where if you are free to harass certain people over their race, gender, or other aspects of identity, then you are preventing them from having the voice to speak their truth. So, you are infringing on their freedom of speech. That’s why there’s this need.”
Whatever the case, these issues are not going away. Methods of communication will continue to change over time, particularly as technology continues to advance. But, Jhaver said, these conversations aren’t anything new either.
“These are age old problems,” he said. “Harassment, free speech, suppression of free speech. These topics have always been discussed, but the internet has changed the way we see them and changed how they manifest themselves.
“I want my research to help minorities and other vulnerable groups have a greater voice in society,” Jhaver said. “I want to contribute to the design of more equitable, inclusive, and participatory technologies.”
Researchers Create Database for News Quality
In this era of “fake news,” it is often the responsibility of the reader to determine what is accurate. Yet a new data project puts the onus back on the industry.
News Quality Aggregator (NewsQA) is a database for news veracity. The database aims to enable media and technology stakeholders to see what factors create high-quality journalism while also preserving freedom of expression and ensuring journalism continues to be economically viable.
The work is showcased in the paper Misinformation Needs a Data Community: the NewsQA project, for which School of Computer Science Professor Ellen Zegura and Hacks/Hackers - Credibility Coalition’s Connie Moon Sehat won the Computing Research Association’s Best Overall Paper award in a CS for Social Good competition for their paper. The award includes a $10,000 grant from Schmidt Futures, a computing for good venture facility.
“The effort to create the database, and a community around it, is an effort to contribute to understanding and addressing this misinformation problem at scale,” said Sehat.
The Project’s Goals
Working with the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at City University of New York, the project has three objectives:
- Creating a database to determine the extent of the problem. From this data, it would be easier to see patterns of information (or “signals”), such as inflammatory language, award-winning reporting. and fact-checked stories.
- Starting a collaborative discussion on characteristics of quality news and the role of freedom of expression with different communities.
- Inviting all stakeholders, including readers, journalists, and technological platforms, to the discussion in order to build solutions.
NewsQA Progress
NewsQA currently has identified about 90 signals from more than 12,500 U.S.-based news and information sites that are being reviewed by advisors to the project. Signals include everything from internet traffic data to self-reported journalist correction policies.
Key to the project is a strong group of advisors and stakeholders who represent all areas of media generation and consumption, and that can provide data. NewsQA’s advising group includes researchers from technological platforms, private artificial intelligence companies, non-profit organizations, and advertisers, such as members from the Facebook Journalism Project, Google Research, and Alphabet Jigsaw.
NewsQA is also establishing partnerships with news misinformation organizations such as Duke University Reporters’ Lab and ClaimReview, TED’s civic initiative, First Draft News, and more.
The goal of the project is to grow the database and the stakeholders participating in it. The researchers plan for NewsQA to scale across languages, countries, and topics, and to grow their community of users, researchers, and advisors.
Ultimately NewsQA aims to preserve freedom of expression while ensuring news is accurate across the internet. The database will show how misinformation enters the news cycle and how it can be mitigated, which will help focus research efforts and inform how media platforms design sites and algorithms. This affects everyone in the news ecosystem, from journalists who want to see their reporting prioritized to consumers who value fair news.
“Democracies need a shared set of facts around which to have constructive conversation,” Sehat said. “Disagreement and conflict are absolutely a part of this, but we need to have confidence in basic narratives and our ability to describe reality, and our technologies should try to support this.”
Fast Times at Student Startup as Global Client List Grows
All they need are some tasty waves and a cool breeze, and kitesurfing instructors are fine.
But no wind, no waves means no dice for scheduled client lessons, likely leading to long hours of rescheduling work and potentially lost revenue for these small business operators.
Seeing a business-to-business opportunity, an Atlanta-based startup has developed a suite of cloud-based services tailored to help kitesurfing instructors manage and grow their businesses.
Board Off–founded in 2018 by four Georgia Tech computer science (CS) majors–released the first version of its product in June. The company now has 30 clients in 17 countries and is on the verge of securing its first round of venture capital funding.
There are other business management apps out there, “but they can be complicated and difficult to use, which is why they have no adoption in this market,” said Philippos Tsamantanis, Board Off co-founder and third-year CS major.
“We are helping people who never went to business school share their passion by giving them tools to efficiently manage their businesses so they can spend more time doing what they love,” said Tsamantanis, who has been kitesurfing since he was 11 and is the inspiration behind Board Off.
Along with scheduling tools for clients, employees, and equipment, Board Off's B2B services provide customer, marketing, and business analytics capabilities.
“People working in this industry aren’t always the most tech-savvy, which requires us to make the product as easy to use as possible,” said Zach Panzarino, co-founder and third-year CS major. “So, we approach every new feature with a focus on good design that minimizes the number of clicks required to complete a certain task.”
The focus on meeting customer needs and “good design” has become a hallmark of the company, which began as one of 40 teams in CREATE-X's 12-week Startup Launch Program at Georgia Tech in late 2018.
“During the phase of customer research we were setting up phone calls with center owners around the world in order to identify their problems and tailor our solution toward them,” said Talib Kateeb, co-founder and alumnus (BS CS 2019).
“Many of our clients have told us that scheduling is consistently a major pain because of the unpredictability of the wind and water. We have been working on making scheduling and rescheduling an easy process that now takes minutes rather than hours,” Kateeb said.
With its initial success in the kitesurfing market, Board Off is beginning to expand to other watersport sectors and is now acquiring clients that offer windsurfing, surfing, and stand-up paddleboarding at their centers.
Along with this vertical expansion, the company believes it can ultimately expand horizontally as well.
“Vertically, Board Off could become the leading company in digitizing the watersports industry from both a business and consumer perspective. Horizontally, the core backend software is applicable in many industries such as landscaping, pilot schools, yoga studios, and more. I see a bright future for the company,” said Kateeb.
Despite having a bright future, it hasn't always been smooth sailing for Board Off. In fact, the team was initially rejected following their first interview to participate in the CREATE-X Startup Launch.
“I didn't know if my idea was good enough to help people, but we did research for a few months and I started to feel more certain that we were on to something. Then, we got rejected by CREATE-X,” said Tsamantanis.
Undaunted by the setback, Tsamantanis, Panzarino, Kateeb, and fellow co-founder and CS major Sudharshan Venkatesh kept at it. After coming back to the table with actual customers using their product–something that set them apart from most of the other teams–Board Off was accepted by CREATE-X.
“The most important lesson I've been taught from this past year is to constantly give 100 percent even when I'm not sure,” said Tsamantanis.
New $1.2 Million NSF Grant Aims to Improve Treatment for PTSD Patients
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), particularly among veterans returning from combat zones or other troubling situations, is a devastating mental condition with tremendous individual and societal costs. About 12 percent of Gulf War veterans and 15 percent of Vietnam veterans suffer from PTSD according to a 2019 article in U.S. News and World Report. While recovery is possible, it requires intensive therapeutic engagement that less than 50 percent of affected veterans actually seek out.
A new four-year, $1.2 million grant from the National Science Foundation to a team of researchers from Georgia Tech, Emory University, and the University of Rochester will help bridge this gap by funding the development of a computational assessment toolkit for PTSD patients and clinicians, called PE Collective Sensing System (PECSS). PECSS, which will sit atop the PE Coach App developed by the Veterans Health Administration and the Department of Defense, will aim to improve current treatment practices and increase the number of veterans who seek treatment.
“PECSS will allow clinicians to use automated predictions to deliver better therapeutic treatment and individualized feedback, and patients to better understand the progress they are making and how to improve their exposure exercises,” said Rosa Arriaga, a Senior Research Scientist in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing and the principal investigator on the project.
[THE INTERACTION HOUR PODCAST: IS TECHNOLOGY A GAME CHANGER FOR CARE OF PTSD PATIENTS?, FEATURING DR. ROSA ARRIAGA]
Currently, the most common and empirically-supported treatment for PTSD is “prolonged exposure” (PE) therapy. The treatment consists of imaginal exposure, where patients imagine themselves and narrate their traumatic event, and in-vivo exposure to real-world stimuli in safe but challenging environments.
There are, however, challenges in data collection and extraction, which is often subjective and narrow. This project will address those challenges by developing a novel, user-tailored sensing system that can record and transfer information from exercises, continuously monitoring patients and clinicians
“Clinicians are in urgent need of methods, tools, and data to efficiently track, assess, and respond to mental health needs throughout the treatment process,” Arriaga said.
The project will involve insights from experts in multiple fields – ubiquitous computing, human-computer interaction, applied machine learning, psychology, and more. IC Associate Professor Thomas Ploetz, a co-principal investigator on the project, will lead the design of novel machine learning methods that will play a key role in analyzing the multi-modal data that will be collected. When complete, the system will be deployed at the Emory Healthcare Veterans Program, a nationally-renowned initiative that treats members of the military suffering from PTSD.
“The Trauma and Anxiety Recovery Program that includes the Emory Veterans Program has been on the cutting edge in using technology to advance the care of people suffering with anxiety since it was founded by Dr. Barbara Rothbaum over 25 years ago,” said Sheila Rauch, an associate professor in Emory’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and a co-principal investigator on the project.
“As a team of international experts in PTSD treatment, we integrate technology to speed response to treatment and help patients to visualize the changes as they respond to care. Our aim is to use this real-time data to find tune practice for the individual patient and learn across patients how we can improve care.”
“Mental health clinicians and their patients are in urgent need of 21st-centural methods, tools, and objective data to optimize therapy,” added Emory Assistant Professor Andrew Sherrill, another co-principal investigator. “This partnership will bring together innovators in HCI and evidence-based psychotherapy to transform mental health care for PTSD patients.”
This grant is provided under the NSF Smart and Connect Health Funding Program in its Division of Information and Intelligent Systems.
Google AI Chief Spends Time with Students during Campus Visit
It’s not every day that Google’s head of artificial intelligence visits Georgia Tech, but when he does he makes an impact. Hosted by the College of Computing and the Machine Learning Center (ML@GT), Jeff Dean, senior fellow and senior vice president at Google AI, spent the day with students and faculty on Oct. 1.
Dean’s main talk was held in the Clough Undergraduate Learning Center. More than 600 people attended to hear his perspective on Using Deep Learning to Solve Challenging Problems. Dean touched on topics including how Google is working to improve diversity, solve healthcare problems, and put autonomous cars on the road during the talk.
Although the talk was his only publicly scheduled event, Dean found time to meet with smaller groups of students while on campus. One of these meetings included an informal Q&A session with students in the machine learning club, The Agency, the evening before his talk.
“It meant a lot to us that Jeff was willing to come talk with us right after getting off a plane from Paris. We had a great conversation and are very appreciative of his time and perspective on so many topics,” said Arda Pekis, a first-year master’s in computer science student who helped to organize the gathering.
Machine learning Ph.D. student Cusuh Ham was one of the select students to eat breakfast with Dean before his talk. A former Google AI intern who still works with Google’s Atlanta office, Ham was thrilled to hear Dean talk about Google Research’s plans to expand to the city.
“A few students expressed their hopes that more companies would come to Atlanta, presenting more opportunities to work in tech outside of the Bay area, and improve diversity within companies. It was great news to me to hear that that’s something of interest to Google,” said Ham.
Many students were thrilled to have the chance to discuss their opinions with someone as influential as Dean.
“Our conversation touched on a variety of topics—how researchers need to be better at multitask learning, the direction of machine learning, and what can be done to make the tech field more diverse. It was exciting to have a conversation with someone as prolific as Jeff Dean and have him hear our opinions,” said Steven Hickson, a machine learning Ph.D. student.
Dean also participated in a round table discussion with key faculty members from each of the College’s three schools and toured the new Coda building.

Partnership Looks for Computing Solutions to Social Challenges
A new six-figure grant is connecting Georgia Tech computer scientists with Georgia State University social scientists in a unique collaboration to address historic social inequities.
The $180,000 grant from the Public Interest Technology Universities Network (PITUN) will fund a two-semester fellowship program for 16 faculty members. PITUN is supported by the Ford Foundation, New America, and the Hewlett Foundation. The grant is the first of its kind awarded by PITUN.
These 16 will split into eight pairs–each with a Georgia Tech computer scientist and a Georgia State social scientist. Each pair will then work to develop interdisciplinary projects addressing historic and continuing inequity challenges in the southeastern United States.
“This collaboration is a unique opportunity to showcase the power of computer science to drive meaningful social progress, as well as the impact that interdisciplinary research can have on real-world issues,” said Ellen Zegura, Georgia Tech computer science professor and co-lead on the fellowship program.
[RELATED: Professor Receives Mozilla Grant to Teach Social Responsibility in Computing]
Susan Snyder, Georgia State School of Social Work associate professor, and Scott Jacques, Georgia State Criminal Justice and Criminology Department associate professor, are co-leads with Zegura on the project.
The grant is one of 27 awarded today as part of PITUN’s inaugural “Network Challenge,” which supports the development of new public interest technology initiatives, especially those that bring together multiple partner schools.
At the end of the two-semester program, the eight teams will present their collaborative projects during a public showcase. The projects will also be documented on a program website, and the program’s structure and materials will be made publicly available for use at other institutions.
According to Zegura, who is the Stephen Fleming Chair in Telecommunications at the Georgia Tech School of Computer Science, the progress won’t end when this initial fellowship does.
“Of course, we can’t solve historic issues of inequity in two semesters,” Zegura said. “But we can highight current public interest challenges in the region, identify potential solutions, and create resources for those at colleges and universities across the Southeast that are interested in picking up the torch on these important issues.”
PITUN, which was convened earlier this year, is a partnership of 21 colleges and universities dedicated to building the nascent field of public interest technology, as well as growing a new generation of civic-minded technologists and digitally-fluent policy leaders.
Award Recognizes Professor's Lasting Contributions to Information Retrieval
Unsupervised learning relies on finding relevant information in large databases. This is possible thanks in part to groundbreaking research by College of Computing Professor Santosh Vempala and his collaborators that was done 20 years ago.
The team's lasting contributions to information retrieval were recently recognized with a test-of-time award. The annual conference Principles of Database Systems (PODS) gave their paper, Latent Semantic Indexing: A Probabilistic Analysis, its Gems of PODS honor at the this year’s conference.
The 1998 paper analyzed a popular spectral algorithm and introduced the very first topic model, now a standard in unsupervised learning.
The researchers discovered that if a database is viewed as a matrix, a computer algorithm can perform singular-value decomposition, a matrix reduction technique that pulls out the most significant directions to explain the data. This step not only involves minimal distortion of data, but it actually yields better retrieval results than the full original matrix.
“This was one of the first provable techniques for automatically extracting information from data,” Vempala said.
The model has been significantly enhanced in the decades since the paper was published. In that time, the work has influenced prominent computing fields such as spectral methods, data mining, machine learning, and deep neural networks.
Vempala wrote the paper as a summer intern at IBM with Prabhakar Raghavan (now VP of Engineering at Google), together with Columbia University Professor Christos Papadimitriou (then at Berkeley), and Meiji University Professor Hisao Tamaki.
As part of the award, Papadimitriou gave a talk during the PODs conference about the paper and its influence.
Premier Computer Vision Conference Accepts 10 Georgia Tech Papers
From helping chair umpires make better line calls in professional tennis to teaching robots to “see”, the field of computer vision continues to expand and become a part of people’s everyday lives. A subfield of artificial intelligence, computer vision teaches computers to understand and interpret the visual world through photos or videos.
The International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) takes place from Oct. 27 to Nov. 2 and brings together researchers from Georgia Tech and around the world to discuss recent breakthroughs and research in the field. Researchers in the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) have ten accepted papers in the conference.
School of Interactive Computing (IC) and ML@GT associate professor Devi Parikh leads with seven research papers. Her work spans from using artificial intelligence (AI) to help people make more stylish outfit choices to embodied visual recognition.
IC assistant professor Judy Hoffman and professor James Rehg are 2019 area chairs.
“As the computer vision field continues to expand and create novel ideas, conferences like ICCV become increasingly important. There was a lot of impressive work submitted to the conference this year. With computer vision being one of ML@GT’s strongest areas, I’m thrilled to see the center’s presence in this premier conference,” said Hoffman.
Other work from Georgia Tech includes papers on lessening the need for additional annotation in videos, making vision and language models more grounded, and agents learning to move to better perceive objects.
"Having a paper accepted, especially as an oral presentation, especially in a top conference gives me lots of confidence and encouragement for my Ph.D. research. I can't wait to attend ICCV to share my work, talk with other talented people, and learn other interesting topics in both academic and industrial areas," said Min-Hung Chen, a sixth-year electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. student.
Organized by IEEE, ICCV is one of the premier international computer vision conferences and will take place at the COEX Convention Center in Seoul, South Korea.

New Insights on Old Solution May Improve HPC Bottleneck
In the realm of high-performance computing (HPC), also known as supercomputing, the idea of “better, faster, stronger” is only as good as the number of tasks a computer can efficiently run at once or complete before moving on to the next step.
Jordi Wolfson-Pou, a Ph.D. student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), is an HPC researcher who has spent the past few months traveling the globe, presenting new insights on an old solution that aims to tackle synchronization bottlenecks in supercomputers.
These new insights highlight the efficacy of using asynchronous multigrid iterative methods for solving large linear systems on exascale computers. The researchers who discovered these findings believe this approach can quicken the computing processes used in a variety of fields, such as physics and engineering.
“Solving equations in physics and engineering often requires highly accurate solutions, which means very large problems need to be solved. This is where supercomputers come in. The next generation of supercomputers will be capable of doing calculations at the exascale and will certainly be fast, but synchronization will limit their speed,” said Wolfson-Pou.
Iterative methods are old computing techniques that start with an initial guess and generate a sequence of improved approximations to the true solution. These methods have achieved remarkable results and showed measurable progress for completing calculations simultaneously. However, the nature of these methods involves one or more synchronization points within each iteration.
“Supercomputers are composed of many parallel processes doing calculations concurrently. If many processes have to synchronize, some may be idle while waiting for others to finish,” said Wolfson-Pou. “For example, this could be due to some processes having to do more calculations than others, or the underlying hardware that a process uses is slower than the hardware another uses. In asynchronous methods, the faster processes simply move on to the next step using the most available information.”
From Brazil to China, Wolfson-Pou presented the new observations he and CSE Professor Edmond Chow discovered while examining multigrid methods in an effort to understand how they can be executed asynchronously.
Their findings are detailed in the paper, Asynchronous Multigrid Methods, which was presented at the following:
- International Parallel & Distributed Computing Symposium (IPDPS), May 20-24, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
- International Conference on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM), July 15-19, Valencia, Spain
- International Multigrid Conference (IMG), August 11-16, Kunming, China
- AMG Summit, September 30 – October 3, Santa Fe, New Mexico
The paper’s experimental results show that asynchronous multigrid can be faster than classical multigrid in terms of reducing the time it takes to converge to the solution.
Students Cultivate Community at Grace Hopper
Infinite possibility is the general theme of the Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC), and College of Computing women were in the center of it.
Eighty students represented the College, including fourth-year computer science student Jhillika Kumar, who was given the Student of Vision Abie Award and delivered part of the opening keynote.
Kumar helped kick-off the three-day conference with her speech on improving employment opportunities for people with autism through her startup, AxisAbility. The project has shown her how computing can reframe common misconceptions and empower individuals.
“Together we can turn disability into a world filled with infinite possibility,” she said.

The conference has become the largest gathering of women in technology with a record-breaking 26,000 attendees at this year’s event in Orlando, Florida. Organized by the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology and the Association for Computing Machinery, GHC brings together industry leaders, pioneering academics, and students for keynotes, technical and career development panels, mentoring sessions, and a career fair.
With scholarships provided by the College, 36 undergraduate students, 18 master’s students, 2 Ph.D. students, and 24 Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) students attended.
Faculty also joined, including School of Interactive Computing (IC) Chair Ayanna Howard and IC Senior Research Scientist Carrie Bruce. Howard led mentoring sessions and moderated a panel on design inclusion in artificial intelligence.
College staff from the Office of Outreach, Enrollment and Community hosted a recruiting booth at the career fair as a gold-level sponsor of the conference.
Although many students come to find internship and job opportunities, one of the conference’s strongest attractions for attendees is the community it provides.
Niaz Pour, a third-year computational media student, believed seeing different examples of what women do in the field could influence her career in user experience (UX) design.
“I really wanted to see the diversity of women in computing,” she said. “I don’t want to work somewhere that’s only designers. I’m a Persian in UX design, so I wanted to find someone on a similar path, and I met two women on the first day.”
GHC was also a networking opportunity for many students, like for OMSCS student Shijie Shi. As a financial analyst for the World Bank, she doesn’t get to interact with many women in computing on a day-to-day basis.
“I wanted to find a community because working in finance, sometimes I forget I have another part of me that does computing,” she said. “It’s very inspiring to see there are computer scientists making amazing things.”
Slice of New $20 Million NSF Project Funding Research to Advance Network Resiliency
As climate change brings more extreme weather around the world, network reliability is vital to getting people out of harm’s way. Yet these systems are increasingly vulnerable to service outages caused by severe storms and rising sea levels.
To ensure computing and telecommunications networks can be counted on to work when they are most needed, the National Science Foundation (NSF) is earmarking part of a new $20 million networking project for Georgia Tech researchers to improve network resilience.
The five-year FABRIC project aims to design and build a large-scale network structure with enhanced resiliency that can be programmed from anywhere and optimized for storage and performance. School of Computer Science Senior Research Scientist Russell Clark’s Smart Sea Level Sensors is one of the application test beds that will be used in validating the proposed infrastructure’s effectiveness.
“The unique piece Georgia Tech is bringing to FABRIC is this emphasis on resilience and survivability,” Clark said. “We need networks to work during storms and earthquakes.”
Since 2017, Clark and his team have installed 43 internet-enabled sensors to collect real-time data on coastal flooding for Chatham County as part of the Georgia Smart Communities Challenge. They next model the data to make projections for emergency response planning.
Although the sensors have improved data collection, they often lose network connectivity during storm events, according to Clark.
“These sensors are designed to meet a critical first responder need during a storm, so it is important that the network and applications are also available,” he said.
Clark will consult on the network’s design and ultimately lead experiments on it using the sensor data. He is one of 23 principal investigators on the endeavor, which also includes researchers in distributed systems, machine learning, and cybersecurity. FABRIC is anchored at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
HPC Framework Blocks May Instigate a New Era of Accessibility for Software Engineers
Researchers are beginning a three-year cross-institute project that aims to lower the barrier to entry for software engineers developing new high-performance applications on large scale parallel systems.
The new $1.26 million National Science Foundation (NSF) project seeks to develop compiler tools and runtime systems to create a framework, named Parallel Algorithms by Blocks (PAbB), built specifically to facilitate simpler programming of scalable parallel systems in high-performance computing (HPC) and exascale machines.
“Current supercomputers and exascale machines are getting harder to program because of how technology is evolving,” said School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Professor Ümit Çatalyürek.
Çatalyürek is Georgia Tech’s principal investigator (PI) for the project and joins the project’s lead PI, University of Utah Professor Ponnuswamy Sadayappan, and co-PIs, Ananth Kalyanaraman, Aravind Sukumaran Rajam, and Sriram Krishnamoorthy of Washington State University. The team of researchers plan to combine user insights, new compiler optimizations, and advanced runtime support to create the PAbB framework which will ultimately create building blocks of parallel code for heterogeneous environments to use across a number of applications from computational science and data science.
From caches to networks, architectures are written so that a system inherently wants to transfer multiple items at once. And, according to Çatalyürek, when looking at algorithms and problems, and thinking of them in terms of blocks – or packages of data – they are able to take advantage of hardware transfer and have better scheduling of communication and computation in these heterogeneous systems.
“We cannot make the single core in a computer much faster anymore, which is why sequential programs are not gettingfaster, and why we have to do everything in parallel computing,” he said.
“If you look at today’s supercomputers you will see that all of the architectures are becoming more and more heterogenous. So, writing parallel code by itself without heterogeneity is difficult, but, when combined, it becomes a barrier for many engineers.”
Heterogenous systems are made up of hardware and software components that necessitate the use of different languages, run on different operations, and usually incorporate specialized processing capabilities to handle particular tasks.
Researchers, particularly those in the HPC and exascale spaces, need a way to ensure they write their data and computation to work in these heterogenous environments, on multiple nodes, and are still able to communicate effectively with the rest of a program while producing the results fast. PAbB aims to become the first framework that achieves both high productivity and high performance in such environments by creating a framework that utilizes block programming.
Opportunities for Impact: Startup Zyrobotics Helped Ayanna Howard Reach More People
Ayanna Howard was not thinking about starting a business. Working as a professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) in 2013, her focus was on her research into assistive robotics and therapy gaming applications for children, not launching a startup outside of her lab.
Doing research in an environment like Georgia Tech’s, however, where entrepreneurship and risk-taking is not only encouraged but required, has a way of making even the clearest of plans veer off in varying unforeseen directions. Thus, out of her lab came Zyrobotics, a technology company that develops educational technologies for children with differing abilities.
For the past six years, Zyrobotics has developed personalized technologies that stimulate social, cognitive, and motor skill development using fun and educational applications. Now, there are five products, three hardware and two software. The software comprises about 15 different programs in math, robot, and coding education. There have been over 600,000 downloads and about 80 distributors using or distributing the products in clinics and school systems.
“As researchers, we’re not only concerned with development,” said Howard, now the Chair of Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing (IC). “We want to know the impact. What Zyrobotics has done is allowed the research we were doing in the lab to touch so many more people than we otherwise would have done.”
A proof of concept
It started as the work of one of her graduate students in ECE. Hae Won Park was finishing up her Ph.D. when she came to a bit of a crossroads. Trying to decide whether to pursue a career in academia or to, perhaps, go into industry, she looked to Howard for some guidance.
“There was an opportunity with the National Science Foundation I-Corps grant where you have to write a proposal, put your ideas down, defend to a program manager, et cetera,” Howard said. “It seemed like a good program that would allow her to experience all of these aspects in a low-risk way. If it didn’t work out, oh well.”
Park’s research examined methods for utilizing touchscreen interfaces for accessible human-robot interaction. It was a project called TabAccess, an assistive technology that provides alternative switch inputs to control smartphones and tablets for users with motor impairments.
VIDEO: How does TabAccess work?
Throughout the course of customer discovery, where Park and Howard spoke with varying professionals and potential users, Howard said she realized just how big of a difference the technology could make outside of the lab.
“A year later, it was enough of a concept,” Howard said. “It looked like we could design something that made sense. The company was founded, and then it went off and did its own thing.”
A broader impact
It was the impact that led Howard to push forward on the project as a startup. At the time, she had been doing robotics educational STEM camps focused on children with special needs. Students, who had primarily visual and motor impairments, were taught how to code robots.
The camps were successful, but the touch points, as Howard called them, were relatively few.
“The touch points were just the kids I was able to recruit along with my clinical collaborator,” she said. “My touch point was: If I show up, I touched. If I didn’t, there was nothing going on. Whereas, in customer discovery, you weren’t necessarily speaking with the people you were impacting – the kids – but you were speaking with the teachers who interact with kids.”
Suddenly, the impact in her mind shifted from the 1-to-1 relationship of STEM camps to 1-to-100, 1-to-1,000, and more.
“My workshop on a good day had maybe 10 kids,” she said. “I did these in a good year maybe twice. So, maybe like 20 kids in a year. You can’t possibly do what we’re doing now without Zyrobotics.”
'For students, (entrepreneurship) is a no-brainer'
Howard said it’s this mindset that sets Georgia Tech apart.
“Students have always thought about the impact of what they’re doing,” she said. “Socially-responsible engineering. That’s always been the core mission. Being an entrepreneur has this aspect of knowing the exact problems you want to attack, versus maybe going into industry and working on someone else’s.”
It’s important, she said, that academics continue to have a place in the technological market. If left to major tech conglomerates, we up against group think and hesitating to take necessary risks.
“For students, it’s a no-brainer to engage in some entrepreneurial pursuit,” she said. “That mindset of thinking about problems and impacts allows you to view it differently.
“We need to be willing to make mistakes. The probability is that your startup will fail. But students understand that and still do it. We need to get rid of that fear of failure, or else we’ll never make significant change.”
Keep Forgetting Your Password? Try This Novel Virtual Authentication Technique
First-person Virtual Maze Offers More Memorable, Harder-to Break Passwords for Infrequent Authentication
We’ve all been there. For the first time in months, you’ve been logged out of your social media account and need to log back in. The problem is it’s been so long since your last log in that you don’t remember your password. You try every combination of baby and pet name, sister’s birthday, childhood street address – nothing works, and now you’re locked out.
If only there was a better way to remember these passwords after extended periods of disuse.
Luckily, researchers at Georgia Tech have come up with a novel solution to this longstanding problem, applying an old memory technique to new technology to offer users a more effective authentication method. Known as ‘the Memory Palace, the new tool is a three-dimensional virtual labyrinth navigated in the first-person perspective.
In cases of infrequent authentication, the Memory Palace works in place of an account’s password. Users create their own personal path with multiple left or right turns through a maze that must then be recreated to log in to their account. If the user makes it through the maze, similar to the one found in the old Windows three-dimensional labyrinth screensaver, they gain access.
Studies evaluating the technique showed that visual-spatial secrets were most memorable if navigated in the three-dimensional first-person perspective. They also showed that, in comparison to Android’s 9-dot pattern lock, the Memory Palace was significantly more memorable after one week, was harder to break through shoulder surfing (capturing passwords by looking over someone’s shoulders), and were not significantly slower to enter.
VIDEO: Explore 'The Memory Palace'
“Humans have evolved with remarkably persistent and fast-imprinting spatial memories, owing in no small part to our nomadic history,” said School of Interactive Computing Assistant Professor Sauvik Das, the lead researcher on the project. “Many people can, for example, clearly visualize and mentally walk through their childhood homes, even if they haven’t stepped foot in it for decades. They may only need to be shown once or twice how to drive to a new part of a familiar city.
“Our key insight was simple: Why not co-opt this incredibly strong spatial memory system for infrequent authentication?”
This visual-spacial authentication is based upon an old memory technique of the same name, also called the “method of loci.” That approach uses visualizations with the use of spatial memory, familiar information about one’s environment, to quickly and efficiently recall information. World Memory champions have applied this technique in competition for years, associating vivid images along a specific path with digits, letters, or playing cards they are required to memorize. In fact, the technique dates all the way back to ancient Greeks and Romans.
When developing their program, researchers focused on a few keys to their method. In addition to security against common attacks like random guessing or shoulder surfing, they needed the authentication secret to be memorable without much practice or reinforcement and they needed it to be deployable to the public.
“Users are unlikely to accept a solution that requires significant upfront training or effort,” said Das, an expert in a field dubbed social cybersecurity that examines social norms that impact the adoption or rejection of security techniques. “Also, the solution should be cost-effective and not require specialized hardware. Many authentication solutions have been proposed, but most fail to be widely adopted for these reasons.”
Existing solutions fall short in these requirements. Biometrics, like a thumb print or facial recognition, require specialized hardware that can be expensive for infrequent use cases. PINs and graphical passwords have problems in long-term memorability without frequent reinforcement, or are otherwise vulnerable to shoulder surfing.
“The Memory Palace addresses each of these concerns with a proven memory technique that can hold up over time but is not easily stolen,” Das said.
Das provided a handful of potential instances of infrequent authentication. Perhaps a session persists for a long period of time, like social media accounts, or a user must log in on a different device than normal, like a Netflix account on a web browser versus a smart TV. Other situations include occasionally-accessed resources, like a conference room secured with a smart lock, or as a fallback authentication method where a secondary secret is needed to recover access to an account where the primary secret has been compromised.
To deploy to the public, an app could implement the Memory Palace as a means of authenticating users. Alternatively, an operating system like Android could implement it as a means of authenticating into a device and automatically handle authenticating into any existing apps on the device.
This work was presented in a paper, titled The Memory Palace: Exploring Visual-Spatial Paths for Strong, Memorable, Infrequent Authentication (Sauvik Das, David Lu, Taehoon Lee, Joanne Lo, Jason I. Hong), at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST 2019), which was held Oct. 20-23 in New Orleans.
FairVis is Helping Data Scientists Discover Societal Biases in their Machine Learning Models
Researchers at Georgia Tech, Carnegie Mellon University, and University of Washington have developed a data visualization system that can help data scientists discover bias in machine learning algorithms.
FairVis, presented at IEEE Vis 2019 in Vancouver, is the first system to integrate a novel technique that allows users to audit the fairness of machine learning models by identifying and comparing different populations in their data sets.
According to School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Professor and co-investigator Polo Chau, this feat has never been accomplished by any platform before, and is a major contribution of FairVis to the data science and machine learning communities.
“Computers are never going to be perfect. So, the question is how to help people prioritize where to look in their data, and then, in a scalable way, enable them to compare these areas to other similar or dissimilar groups in the data. By enabling comparison of groups in a data set, FairVis allows data to become very scannable,” he said.
In order to do accomplish this, FairVis uses two novel techniques to find subgroups that are statistically similar.
The first technique groups similar items together in the training data set, calculates various performance metrics like accuracy, and then shows users which groups of people the algorithm may be biased against. The second technique uses statistical divergence to measure the distance between subgroups to allow users to compare similar groups and find larger patterns of bias.
These outputs are then viewed and analyzed through FairVis’ visual analytics system, which is designed to specifically discover and show intersectional bias.
Intersectional bias, or bias that is found when looking at populations defined by multiple features, is a mounting challenge for scientists to tackle in an increasingly diverse world.
“While a machine learning algorithm may work very well in general, there may be certain groups for which it fails. For example, various face detection algorithms were found to be 30 percent less accurate for darker skinned women than for lighter skinned men. When you look at more specific groups of sex, race, nationality, and more, there can be hundreds or thousands of groups to audit,” said Carnegie Mellon University Ph.D. student Alex Cabrera.
Cabrera is the primary investigator of FairVis and has been pursuing this problem since he was an undergraduate student at Georgia Tech.
“During the summer of my junior year I had been researching various topics in machine learning, and discovered some recent work showing how machine learning models can encode and worsen societal biases. I quickly realized that not only was this a significant issue, with examples of biased algorithms in everything from hiring systems to self-driving cars, but that my own work during my internship had the possibility to be biased against lower socioeconomic groups.”
This is when Cabrera reached out to Chau who then recruited the help of CSE alumni Minsuk Kahng, CSE Ph.D. Fred Hohman, College of Computing undergraduate student Will Epperson, and University of Washington Assistant Professor Jamie Morgenstern.
Morgenstern is the lead researcher for a number of projects related to fairness in machine learning, including the study Cabrera mentioned about self-driving cars. This particular study shows the potentially fatal consequences of algorithmic bias which highlights the severity of software created without fairness embedded into its core.
FairVis is one of the first systems that helps us achieve a dramatic step towards understanding and addressing the problem of fairness in machine learning, and prevents similar headlines from making their way to reality in the future.
However, Cabrera stressed that the solution does not simply end with better data practices.
“Fairness is an extremely difficult problem, a so-called ‘wicked problem’, that will not be solved by technology alone,” he said.
“Social scientists, policy makers, and engineers need to work together to make inroads and ensure that our algorithms are equitable for all people. We hope FairVis is a step in this direction and helps people start the conversation about how to tackle and address these issues.”
Hydra is the First Fuzzing Framework to Find Any File System Bug
Georgia Tech researchers have developed a new tool that can find one of the most challenging types of bug.
Called Hydra, the framework provides building blocks for file system fuzzers to find semantic errors, helping developers save time. Using Hydra, the researchers have found 155 new bugs in Linux file systems.
“The name Hydra comes from the Greek mythological monster that has multiple heads because our approach brings multiple bug checkers into a unified framework, enabling the testing of multiple aspects of file systems,” said School of Computer Science (SCS) Ph.D. student Seulbae Kim.
Finding Semantic Bugs
File systems are the center of any operating systems. Yet as they grow larger, the potential for bugs only increases. Bugs can cause chaos for users, from unwanted reboots to corruption of an entire system — not to mention security vulnerabilities.
Eliminating bugs individually is nearly impossible, so developers often rely on fuzzing to expedite the process. The generalized automatic software testing technique injects mutated inputs to discover bugs and test how robust the system is. Typically, fuzzing is only designed for detecting memory errors, but the researchers wanted to tackle a more challenging category, semantic bugs.
Sematic bugs come in many forms, from violating main properties of the system like crash safety to the developers’ incorrect assumptions. Each issue often requires a specialized checker to find the bug. Yet, all semantic bugs have one thing in common: Their failure does not register in the kernel in the same way memory bugs do. Their undetectable nature means previous fuzzers can’t be used out of the box.
“Semantic bugs do not explicitly manifest themselves,” Kim said. “They are silent. The effects are often internal and only revealed upon some special condition.”
Expanding Fuzzing
Hydra enables plugged-in bug checkers to work on their own while offloading file system checking to Hydra. This helps eliminate any type of file system bugs, including three common types:
·Crash inconsistency, when a file system fails to recover to a correct state after a crash
·Specification violation (often known as POSIX standards), when the file system’s behavior does not conform to the specifications of how it should behave
·Logic bugs, when bugs are specific to a file system’s implementation of an algorithm or an invalid assumption

Building from the researchers’ prior work with the fuzzer Janus, Hydra provides common tools developers need to debug a file system, including:
·Input mutator to generate test cases that are likely to trigger bugs
· libOS-based executor that executes the test case against targeted file system and runs plugged-in bug checkers
· Feedback engines that summarize the effects of test cases and determine if they are effective enough to further mutate
·Bug reproducer with a test case minimizer that automatically verifies the reported test cases and reduces the size of the test case, respectively
“With these jobs offloaded, a developer now can only focus on writing a reliable bug checker (if it does not already exist) for the bug type he or she is interested in finding,” Kim said.
Kim presented the work at ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP) in Huntsville, Ontario, Canada from Oct. 27 to 30. He co-wrote the paper, Finding Semantic Bugs in File Systems with an Extensible Fuzzing Framework with SCS Ph.D. students Meng Xu, Sanidhya Kashyap, Jungyeon Yoon, and Wen Xu, and SCS Associate Professor Taesoo Kim.
Making Sure Computing Machines Don’t Stereotype People
Machine learning algorithms dominate society, from helping judges with courtroom decisions to influencing banks on who gets loans. With big and small decisions potentially being swayed by these mathematical equations, research has become dedicated to making algorithms more transparent and fair.
Uthaipon (Tao) Tantipongpipat and Samira Samadi, Georgia Tech Ph.D. students in the School of Computer Science, recently published a new paper that takes large data sets for population analysis and reduces the dimension of those data sets while also preserving essential traits of the groups being analyzed. Algorithms can handle millions of records but the process might compress information and lose details. This, in turn, can lead to groups of people being unfairly associated with certain behaviors or characteristics.
Samadi and Tantipongpipat’s previous work uses principal component analysis (PCA), a dimension reduction technique that has been the gold standard for analyzing large data sets more efficiently. Their own version, Fair-PCA, uses the strength of PCA and retains more information so that algorithms can, in theory, have better data for decision-making.
In their latest work, the duo is optimizing Fair-dimensionality reduction, allowing populations to be more accurately represented when not only using PCA, but a wider class of dimension reduction techniques.
The updated algorithm incorporates multiple equity measurements for populations – i.e. with respect to social and economic welfare – and takes into account multiple demographical attributes. For example, gender is usually analyzed as male and female, but this leaves transgender people and other non-binary people out of an algorithm’s calculations leading to unfair or biased assessments.
This new work is designed to allow machine learning researchers to analyze complex data sets more accurately, potentially leading to less bias.
"I feel like if fairness and bias are not being taken seriously into account at this point, then our problems are only going to compound. Machine learning algorithms are dominating our lives every day and they learn to behave based on previous outcomes. If we just let this build up and if we don't take care of it now, it will have a huge impact, one that may not be as positive as we had hoped,” said Samadi.
The team will present Multi-Criteria Dimensionality Reduction with Applications to Fairness in December at the 33rd Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2019 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
HPC Researchers Boast Two Best Student Paper Finalists at SC19
Supercomputers are crunching numbers to facilitate data analysis in social computing, genomics in healthcare, three-dimensional modeling in materials engineering, and more. And, the number of computational problems that are too large to solve on standard computers is growing rapidly causing high-performance computing (HPC) to become a necessity for industry and academia alike.
Georgia Tech researchers are stepping in to answer this growing need by leading HPC research from a variety of approaches and are preparing to present their latest findings in Denver, Colorado next week at the 2019 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis.
Also known as Supercomputing or SC19, the annual conference features leading research in the fields of HPC and exascale computing with an emphasis on real-world application.
This year, Georgia Tech’s presence boasts four papers, four workshops, two posters, and one Birds of a Feather discussion.
Two of the four papers, CARE: Compiler-Assisted Recovery from Soft Failures and GPU Acceleration of Extreme Scale Pseudo-Spectral Simulations of Turbulence Using Asynchronism are best student paper award finalists. The announcement naming the winner of the award will be made at the SC19 award ceremony on Nov. 21.
Georgia Tech’s presence also comprises a number of activities outside of the conference agenda, including the Georgia Tech booth (#1809) on the vendor floor, which will give SC19 attendees an opportunity to engage directly with researchers, students, and staff alike.
This year, booth #1809 features four live demos provided by researchers and students, including a presentation about the Women in High Performance Computing (WHPC) program by WHPC Director and Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing Research Scientist II Lorna Rivera.

"I’m really proud of Georgia Tech’s presence at SC19 this year, especially the two best paper finalists. It’s a good warm-up for SC20, where we will be the home team,” he said.
Vuduc is referencing the fact that Supercomputing is making its way for the first time to Atlanta next year. This means Georgia Tech’s HPC community is buzzing with anticipation to showcase its newest HPC resource, the Hive.
Advisor Shares Memories of Lecture Series Namesake
Software testing expert Mary Lou Soffa delivered the Mary Jean Harrold Memorial Distinguished Lecture on Nov. 8. Soffa was Harrold’s advisor and discussed the advancements the two made in the field in her talk, Software Testing: And the Challenges (and Opportunities) Keep Coming!
Now in its fifth year, the annual event honors former School of Computer Science (SCS) Professor Mary Jean Harrold by inviting prominent women in computer science to share their work and research philosophies.
“Mary Jean was the third most prolific software engineer, but she also just contributed with her heart and soul to diversity and service of every aspect of the academic community,” SCS and Georgia Tech ADVANCE Professor Dana Randall said in her introduction.
For Soffa, the lecture was personal and a chance to pay tribute to someone whose career ran in tandem with hers.
“Mary Jean was my Ph.D. student, and she was also my dearest friend for a number of years,” Soffa said.
As the Owen R. Cheatham Professor of Sciences in the Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia, Soffa has made her career in software testing, program analysis, warehouse-scale computing, software systems for multi-core architectures, and compiler optimization.
For her talk, Soffa traced the evolution of testing. The idea of separating debugging from testing started in the 1970s. Testing only became a critical part of software development in the 1980s and 1990s, according to Soffa.
“The software industry uses testing as primary way of ensuring software behaves the way we would like it behave and has the quality we want it to have,” Soffa said.
Her lecture broke down software testing field through four concepts:
- coverage criteria, determining how much of the code has been used in the test suite
- regression testing, making sure testing doesn’t make program behave incorrectly and doesn’t adversely impact code or structure
- input generation and test case prioritization and minimization, selecting the minimum number of text cases you need to meet all requirement
- testing oracles, checking the correctness of test cases
All these advances have made it easier for software testing to work with new technologies, such as the cloud or machine learning (ML), Soffa noted. Yet there are still challenges.
“If you make a change in the cloud environment, how do you retest your application?” she said. “If you’re running an app, you have to make sure there’s no change and expand accuracy with low testing costs.”
ML is a completely new environment because it’s based on data, not code, so software engineers must develop a new systematic way of testing that ensures coverage. This is vital as innovations like autonomous vehicles get closer to market.
Soffa underscored the importance of this field by explaining the recent Boeing 737 Max crashes as a failure of software testing. When the plane’s engines were made larger for fuel efficiency, it fundamentally changed the overall design of the plane and its center of gravity. To compensate, Boeing relied on new software. Yet this software wasn’t consistently tested and often by those underqualified to handle such a complex design.
“Is this what we would expect in testing a critical system?” she said. “Perhaps using inexperienced software developers and testers is not a good idea."
Hive Supercomputer Makes its Debut
Georgia Tech now boasts a $5.3 million high-performance computing (HPC) system that is enabling data-driven discovery in data science, computational astrophysics, biology, chemistry, and materials science at the institute.
Known as Hive, this newly operational supercomputer supports research for over 33 faculty, 54 research scientists and postdocs, 195 graduate students, and 56 undergraduate students from the colleges of Computing, Engineering, and Sciences.
Hive was acquired by the Institute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS) through a $3.7 million National Science Foundation (NSF) Major Research and Instrumentation Program grant and a $1.6 million contribution by Georgia Tech in 2018.
[Related News: Georgia Tech Award Equips Coda’s Data Center with New Supercomputer]
IDEaS Director and School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Professor and Interim Chair Srinivas Aluru is the primary investigator on the grant. According to Aluru, “Hive allows us to solve large scale of data-intensive problems and will be an asset to Georgia Tech for the next five years or so.”
The supercomputer has over 100 trillion bytes of memory, 11,500 compute cores, and 2.5 quadrillion bytes of storage. To put it simply, this cluster, which delivers 0.7 petaflops of performance based on the LINPACK Benchmark, is fast.
Local and National Collaborations
Hive represents several interdisciplinary, cross-institute collaborative efforts. One of these is the attachment of this supercomputer to the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) program, which funds and interconnects supercomputers nationwide, enabling national collaborative use of this resource.
“We have reserved about 20 percent capacity of the machine to support research activities of regional partners, minority-serving institutions, and others through the XSEDE Program,” Aluru said.
“One particular segment that we are focusing on is supporting historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and minority institutions in or around Atlanta. We are also providing active training programs to bring faculty and students from these institutions on board to use high-performance computing,” he said.
Currently, Morehouse College, Spelman College, and Clark Atlanta University all have research on the machine with the support of this program.
Georgia Tech’s HPC Future
Hive made its official debut with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Oct. 21 at the Coda datacenter. Georgia Tech Executive Vice President of Research Chouki Abdallah delivered opening remarks before attendees were invited for a private tour of the new facility and an up-close view of the Hive computer – which featured newly-added blue LED lights across its many stacks.
“The institute is trying to come up with a long-term plan for high-performance computing, and this is a manifestation of our performance so far,” said Abdallah during the ceremony.
Part of this plan includes moving all of Georgia Tech’s computing services and the Office of Information Technology to the new data center by the end of the school year.
Six Years in the Making
Hive’s existence represents roughly six years of planning and preparation across Georgia Tech units and several external organizations. This includes the construction of an entirely new 80,000 sq. ft. data center in the Coda building which is managed by DataBank.
Integral to this datacenter planning and readying for the Hive supercomputer was Georgia Tech’s Partnership for an Advanced Computing Environment (PACE) team.
According to PACE Senior HPC Architect Paul Manno, “We have partnered with DataBank and we are working with them to create what is essentially a great research resource, but also a great operations datacenter, for Georgia Tech and others. Before, we were limited by space, power, and cooling in the old datacenter on campus.”
He said, “Now, in addition to having much more space, we are starting out with roughly two megawatts of power for Georgia Tech and we can expand that up to 8-10 megawatts, which gives us the ability to expand well beyond what people had originally envisioned and provides Georgia Tech a means to grow into the future.”
Team Advances to World Finals of Student Programming Contest
With a recent regional victory, a student team from Georgia Tech has qualified to compete for the 2020 global championship in one of the world’s most highly regarded programming contests.
Georgia Tech 5 (GT 5), a team of three College of Computing students, earned first place in the International Collegiate Programming Contest’s (ICPC) 2019 southeast regional qualifier held Nov. 9. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) sponsored the event, which took place at four onsite university locations.
ICPC is an annual algorithmic programming competition for university students around the world.
As regional winners, the team – computer science (CS) major Animesh Fatehpuria and Ph.D. students Li Chen and Yu Gao – automatically advances to the 2020 ICPC World Finals set for June 2020 in Moscow, Russia.
Before heading to Russia, GT 5 is competing in the inaugural ICPC North America Championship, which is being hosted in Atlanta by the College of Computing.
[RELATED: Top Student Programmers Heading to Atlanta for Shot at World Finals]
They will join more than 50 top collegiate computing teams from the U.S. and Canada that will vie to be the first-ever ICPC North America Champions and compete to fill remaining slots in the upcoming World Finals. The event will be held at the Georgia World Congress Center from Feb. 19 - 23.
Along with GT 5, two other Tech teams, GT 1 and GT 7, took top-10 spots in Division I of the southeast regional qualifier.
Team members for GT 1 are CS MS students Yufan Huang and Somnath Sarkar, and CS undergraduate Chris Jung. GT 7 team members include CS undergraduates Amaan Marfatia, Shyamal Patel, and Arvind Ramaswami. A complete listing of 2019 ACM ICPC Southeast Regional competition results are available online.
GT Experts Bring Diverse Perspectives on the Challenges and Importance of Algorithmic Fairness
Academics and industry experts are still not entirely on the same page when it comes to researching fairness and bias in machine learning, even though the results impact people in huge ways, such as if they can receive an organ transplant, are recognized by autonomous vehicles, or advance in the hiring process.
To help aid discussion around this hot topic, the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) hosted a seminar and panel discussion about the work that its faculty members are doing in these areas. On Nov. 6, four faculty members affiliated with ML@GT presented their recent research that is focused on different aspects of fairness and bias.
Panelist and H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) assistant professor Rachel Cummings encouraged attendees to make fairness a priority.
“This field is still so new but also so important. We need more people doing fairness research,” said Cummings.
Cummings’ presentation focused on privacy, data, and algorithmic fairness. Her colleagues Swati Gupta, an assistant professor in ISyE, and Judy Hoffman, an assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing discussed the mathematics of bias and fairness and analyzing fairness in computer vision systems respectively.
“This work encourages us to get back to the basics of what we are doing and why we are doing it. Looking into how these algorithms actually affect people is huge, and we should all be thinking about the impact our work can have on all kinds of people,” said Gupta.
The session was moderated by Deven Desai, an associate professor in the Scheller College of Business.
“A goal of ML@GT’s is to develop the next generation of AI pioneers who are creating new technology that is both socially and ethically responsible, and events like these are a great way to continue to have that conversation with our students,” said Desai.
The center plans to continue hosting events like this on a variety of topics.

CS Professor Earns Award for Pioneering Security Research
Professor Wenke Lee recently received the ACM Special Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC) Outstanding Innovation Award. He is one of several School of Computer Science (SCS) researchers honored at the group’s ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) in London this month.
Lee was recognized for his pioneering contributions to network and systems security. His team was among the first to study how adversaries can subvert machine learning (ML)-based systems. Their work brought ML to security analytics such as tackling intrusion and botnet detection.
“While it is now a standard practice to apply ML to security analytics, we developed the first comprehensive ML framework for intrusion detection 20 years ago, and our papers have since been cited several thousands of times,” Lee said.
Lee’s team has continued to pursue forward-looking research in this important intersection of ML and security. Their recent work focuses on protecting user privacy in deep-learning based biometric authentication and surveillance.
“I have been very fortunate to have the opportunities to work on interesting research projects with my mentors, colleagues, and students in my career,” Lee said. “This award is really for all of us.”
SCS received multiple awards at the conference. Lee’s students earned the best paper award. Kangjie Lu, a former student of Lee and SCS Associate Professor Taesoo Kim, and SCS research scientist Hong Hu won for their paper, Where Does It Go? Refining Indirect-Call Targets with Multi-Layer Type Analysis.
SCS Assistant Professor Paul Pearce was also given the runner-up of the 2019 ACS SIGSAC Doctoral Dissertation Award.
Georgia Tech Researchers Explore New Ways to Give Navigation Directions to Robots
Robots can navigate buildings, but how do they know where to go? While some robots can follow pre-programmed routes, or be controlled by setting waypoints on a map, these methods are inflexible and can be unnatural to use. Researchers at Georgia Tech believe the best way to give robots navigation instructions is by talking to them.
“Giving natural language instructions to a robot is a fundamental research problem on the critical path to developing more flexible domestic robots that can work with people,” said Peter Anderson, a research scientist at Georgia Tech.
In a recent paper, Georgia Tech has introduced a new way for robots to reason about navigation instructions in an unknown environment.
The team created a semantic map representation that updates each time the robot moves or sees something new. To reason about navigation instructions using this map, the lab found a way to leverage an algorithm used in classical robotics and apply it to artificial intelligence. The algorithm, called Bayesian state estimation, usually tracks the location of a robot from sensor measurements like lidar and wheel odometry. By manipulating the algorithm, Georgia Tech says their robots can use it model language instruction inputs instead.
The paper got its title "Chasing Ghosts: Instruction Following as Bayesian State Tracking" because rather than tracking a robot from sensor measurements, the team is tracking the likely trajectory taken by an ideal agent or human demonstrator in response to the instructions. In this approach, the sensor measurements are the instructions themselves. This algorithm allows the agent to “reason” about all the different trajectories it could take and the probability of each trajectory when completing a task. By using an explicit map, researchers are easily able to inspect the model to see where the agent thinks the goal is and where it is likely to move next.
Currently, the robots move in simulated reconstructions of buildings, and communication is through written text, though some applications and off-the-shelf speech-to-text systems could work in conjunction with the existing system, according to researchers.
“Spoken language would definitely be more natural in many situations, so we might in the future investigate models that go directly from speech to robot actions,” said Anderson.
Anderson particularly likes to think about this work in regards to telepresence robots, though it could be applied to any robot.
“Telepresence robots are a great idea, but they are not as popular as they could be. Maybe we need smarter, more natural robots that just go where you tell them to go and look at what you ask them to look at,” said Anderson.
Think about all of the time that is lost commuting to work and walking to meetings. Imagine how climate change might be positively impacted if people needed to travel less for business. Anderson hopes that this work will allow people to focus more on their meetings, conversations with people, and, perhaps, help with climate change, rather than micromanaging a robot or jetting off around the world.
This work will be presented in December at the Thirty-third Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2019 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
ML@GT Displays Diverse Research Interests at NeurIPS
With 30 papers to present, the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) will make a strong showing at this year’s Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, Dec. 8-14 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
The conference fosters the exchange of research on the theoretical, technological, biological, and mathematical aspects of neural information processing systems. ML@GT research spans all of the categories, including work on neural data, fairness in machine learning algorithms, and teaching artificial intelligence to work in changing environments.
“NeurIPS continues to be an exciting conference to attend because of the diverse research that is being presented each year. It is one of the most sought-after and anticipated conferences every year, and it’s good to see ML@GT have a good variety of papers being accepted,” said Tuo Zhao, an assistant professor in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE). Zhao has three accepted papers.
NeurIPS also continues to be a hotspot for major technology companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and to recruit new talent.

Helping Underserved Populations Through Evaluation
Every year, thousands of researchers flock to Supercomputing (SC), the leading conference for high-performance computing (HPC) research, to present best practices and findings in the HPC field. Groups focused on creating inclusive measures in the HPC community have been steadily growing over the past few years at SC, and Georgia Tech’s own Lorna Rivera is a catalyst for several of these initiatives.
Rivera is a research scientist at Georgia Tech’s Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC) and for the Women in High-Performance Computing (WHPC).
Her research for both of these programs helps aggregate and analyze data in meaningful ways to determine custom-tailored approaches to advance initiatives focused on minority or underserved groups.
After providing a booth talk detailing initiatives in CEISMC and WHPC during SC19, the School of Computational Science and Engineering had the opportunity to discuss with Rivera updates on her latest efforts.
[Related News: Diversifying the HPC Community: Q&A with Georgia Tech’s Lorna Rivera]
For those unfamiliar, can you give a CEISMC from 30,000-foot view?
CEISMC connects Georgia Tech to surrounding K12 schools, focusing on underserved and minority areas, and works to move the needle in the state of Georgia to improve representation in the scientific areas of STEM and computing. It is led by Dr. Lizanne DeStefano who has a reputation for not only pushing those programs but also in evaluating their effectiveness.
A lot of what CEISMC does is focused on evaluation of these programs. Can you tell us a what this evaluation looks like and what you are looking for?
Evaluation can mean a lot of things and it differs from research, although you can do both research and evaluation. Evaluation differs in that you want to have a deep understanding of the context in which you are working. In research, you often want to wash out context because you want to be able to replicate things, and you can do that with evaluation too, they’re not completely separate boxes. But sometimes in evaluation, you study things not necessarily with the intention of replicating but because you want to understand the unique factors of that particular situation.
What kind of communities are you looking to serve or help enhance in your initiatives?
I personally try to always pay attention to those who are underserved in a particular community. I use an evaluation approach that accounts for what we look at in thirds. So, one third is focused on the quality of science being done, another third is focused on the way that science is being taught, and the remaining third is focused on the disadvantaged in that group that is being served. Then, in the middle, if you think about it like a Venn Diagram, those three come together and that is where you find the program and evaluation.
For more information about the approach, which was pioneered by CEISMC Executive Director Lizanne DeStefano, click here.
Does this approach transcend or translate to your efforts with the WHPC program?
Absolutely! I am the director of research for Women in HPC and it’s an organization that started at the University of Edinburgh’s EPCC and it is now an international organization. My role with WHPC is to understand the unique experiences of women in the international HPC community. You may notice that women of color are extremely underrepresented in this community, so, I am particularly passionate about moving the needle in this space. It is very important to me and, the way that we can accomplish this is, yet again, by evaluation. The WHPC programs are all new and are being rolled out now, so I am in the initial phases of evaluating. We have the mentoring program, which I got to talk about today in the Georgia Tech booth, we have a fellowship program that we just started, and we have our first three fellows with us this year. Then we are looking to broaden and see what else we can do in this space while growing sustainably because we do not want to grow too fast.
This sounds like WHPC has a lot going on – not to mention your first inaugural event is coming up! Can you tell us a little about it and what to expect?
We have our first Women in HPC Summit at the end of April and early May that is going to be held together with Simon Fraser University and will be held in Vancouver, Canada. We are very excited! There will be a series of technical talks, workshops, and tutorials. Sometimes, we hear from our members that they do not want to focus on the technical content and rather they want to focus on the experience of women, or vice versa and that they want to focus on the technical. We are hoping, now that we have our own event and are not limited to a one-day workshop, we can meet both of those needs.
Is there anything else you want to stress to people regarding the WHPC?
If you are interested in this topic, regardless of your gender, WHPC is for everybody. We need everybody involved and as many advocates as possible. Please don’t let the name turn anyone off, we are open to all and we want to make this a better space for everyone!
OMSCS Wins Oscars of Educational Technology
The Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) won Reimagine Education’s gold award for the best distributed/online program for nurturing 21st-century skills. The program also received a bronze award in Computing & IT for OMSCS course CS1301: Introduction to Computing Using Python.
“These awards really show that the world recognizes the need to expand access to affordable, high-quality CS education, and also shows that the College of Computing is leading the way in creating those experiences," said Associate Director of Student Experience David Joyner.
Reimagine Education, an annual educational technology conference and award ceremony, took place in London, U.K., from Dec. 8 to 10. The awards highlight work from startups, universities, and corporations that enhances student learning outcomes and employability in what is known as the “Oscars of Education.”
This year’s awards were competitive with a pool including 1,518 submissions in 16 major categories. OMSCS was one of 160 finalists. A panel of 180 international judges selected the winners. OMSCS was also one of 12 finalists for the competition's grand prize.
Former John P. Imlay, Jr. Dean of Computing Zvi Galil and Joyner represented the program at the awards gala, where Joyner provided attendees with an overview of the OMSCS program.
“David wrote our submission and gave an excellent presentation,” said Galil. “Many thanks to David and congratulations to all of us!”
Yet OMSCS’s impact is the work of many, according to Joyner.
"This award really does belong to everyone involved in the program: the faculty, the advisers, the staff, the teaching assistants, the students, everyone,” Joyner said. “Without any of them, this program wouldn't be what it is today."
In the five years since the College of Computing launched OMSCS, the program has grown from 380 students to nearly 10,000 with 2,000 alumni. Now the largest computer science master’s in the country, it also led to the creation of two more online degrees from Georgia Tech: OMS Analytics and OMS Cybersecurity.
Polo Chau Receives Intel Outstanding Researcher Award
School of Computational Science and Engineering Associate Professor Polo Chau received the 2019 Outstanding Researcher Award from Intel, honoring his innovations in artificial intelligence and security, and for his contributions to the Intel Science & Technology Center for Adversary-Resilient Security Analytics (ISTC-ARSA) at Georgia Tech.
The award is given annually to recognize researchers across scientific disciplines who have demonstrated exceptional innovation for work related to Intel initiatives.
According to the award description, Chau was recognized specifically for his enthusiasm to share knowledge with his fellow researchers while helping advance and demonstrate the ARSA center’s research values.
“Periodically, Intel funds different centers to nurture and strengthen long-term collaborative relationships with academia. Intel is an excellent partner for transitioning research into practice to to solve challenging real world problems to benefit society,” said Chau.
Established in 2016 through a $1.5 million gift from Intel to Georgia Tech, the ISTC-ARSA has developed new security approaches for machine learning algorithms by studying application vulnerabilities in security analytics, search engines, facial and voice recognition, fraud detection, and more.
Chau said, “Machine learning is used in all sorts of applications including high-stake problems such as directing self-driving cars or creating systems that determine how resources get allocated in an organization. So, a lot of critical solutions came out of the initial ARSA project in a short time.”
Several large projects with real-world solutions that were led by Chau in the three short years that the center has been in operation include:
- Keeping the Bad Guys Out: Protecting and Vaccinating Deep Learning with JPEG Compression
- MLsploit
- ShapeShifter
- SHIELD
“The research focus of the center has really shaped a lot of the work I have been doing in the past three years and also what we are doing now. I think that it is an excellent problem space to work in because machine learning is is increasingly used in society to help make sense of large amount of complex data in the world,” he said.
ML@GT Adds Six New Associate Directors to Leadership Team
The Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) continues to diversify and expand its leadership team. Starting in January the leadership team will add Deven Desai, Polo Chau, Mark Davenport, Yao Xie, Mark Riedl, and George Lan as associate directors.
Desai, an associate professor in the Scheller College of Business, will be the center’s first associate director for Legal, Policy, Ethics, and Machine Learning. Not a technologist by training, Desai will draw from his experience working at Princeton's Center for Information Technology Policy and Google as Academic Research Counsel to help policy makers, legal scholars and technologists work better together. This includes helping each party understand how a given technology works and what issues it might raise.
“I am excited to be part of ML@GT because of the opportunity to be part of a world class group of thinkers and to connect our work to the world. I believe there is a need to bridge the worlds of technology and law, policy, and ethics,” said Desai. “ML@GT is poised to increase not only machine learning insights and breakthroughs but also the way in which machine learning is built and used to serve society. I am honored and thrilled to be part of building that future.”
Xie, an associate professor in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial Systems Engineering (ISyE), is the first woman to join the leadership team. She will serve as the associate director for machine learning and data science where she will create better synergy between the ongoing research and education efforts between data science and machine learning as Georgia Tech builds a leading program in these areas.
“I am particularly excited to work with the broader community of students and faculty on campus who are interested or involved with machine learning and data science and foster their participation,” said Xie.
Lan, also an associate professor in ISyE has been appointed as the associate director for machine learning and statistics. In this role, Lan will promote research at the intersections between optimization, statistics, and machine learning and how they also apply in engineering. He will also help better facilitate communications for students coming from different home colleges or schools across campus.
“I am excited to be joining the team with active and dynamic academic leaders. I look forward to working with them to address a diverse set of challenges that ML@GT faces, e.g., being adaptive to the priorities and criterions for our affiliated faculty members and students across different academic units,” said Lan.
As the associate director for machine learning and artificial intelligence, Riedl, an associate professor in the School of Interactive Computing, will coordinate ML@GT’s strategy with respect to the broader field of artificial intelligence.
“Artificial intelligence and machine learning have the potential to radically change virtually every aspect of our lives. With thought and care, these technologies can be a force for good. Georgia Tech is well-positioned to be a major voice in how technology and policy shape the future,” said Riedl.
With more corporations integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence into their businesses, the center’s need for managing those relationships has increased significantly. Chau, an associate professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering, will lead those relationships as the associate director for corporate relations for machine learning.
“I enjoy bringing people together, connecting industry with Georgia Tech researchers, bridging disciplines and innovating at their intersections. I’m excited to begin my new role as it will be a great way to help Georgia Tech further expand its national and global footprint,” said Chau.
As the associate director for community and students, Davenport is charged with creating a tight-knit community among faculty and students. Davenport, an associate professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, will work closely with the center staff to coordinate events and other opportunities to increase discussion and collaboration between research units.
The six new members will join existing leadership members Irfan Essa, Justin Romberg, Zsolt Kira, and Le Song.

Professor Awarded Two Fellow Titles for Modeling and Simulation in Same Week
Earning the distinction of fellow for scientific societies is an honor that many researchers spend their careers working toward. For School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Regents’ Professor Richard Fujimoto, this was an honor earned not only once, but twice in early December.
Fujimoto was named an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Fellow and a 2019 Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) Fellow for his work in parallel and distributed discrete event simulation. The announcement for both of these recognitions came only two years after he was named an Association for Computing Machinery Fellow in 2017.
According to the IEEE association, the IEEE Fellow is the highest grade of membership and is recognized by the technical community as a prestigious honor and an important career achievement. No more than one-tenth of one percent of the society’s membership is selected for the fellow grade each year.
I/ITSEC is the world’s largest modeling, simulation, and training conference. Each year, one individual is selected as the I/ITSEC Fellow, an award that is given in recognition of a researcher’s exceptional contributions to the field of modeling and simulation.
In this field, discrete event simulations are used to model operations within a system and have uses in a wide variety of applications. Fujimoto has authored and co-authored hundreds of technical papers on the as well as several books subject, which span application areas including transportation systems, telecommunication networks, and multiprocessor and defense systems.
Among his various accomplishments, Fujimoto cited one body of work that had perhaps the greatest impact: “The High Level Architecture (HLA) for modeling and simulation (M&S) originally came out of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) at a time when their strategy was shifting from single stand-alone simulators to networking many simulators together,” said Fujimoto.
“HLA created a common architecture for all modeling and simulation in the DoD. I was responsible for leading the team responsible for defining the time management services that enabled different simulators to synchronize their interactions.”
Fujimoto’s team completed the HLA effort in 1996, which became standardized with IEEE 1516, and is still in use today.
Now, much of Fujimoto’s current work focuses on executing discrete event simulations for mobile devices.
“In mobile computing environments, energy consumed by the computation is a large concern because it affects battery life. So, focusing on how to build energy efficient distributed simulations is where a lot of my work has been focused in the past couple of years,” he said.
Fujimoto’s work in the field of discrete event simulation began in the 1980’s, long before mobile environments were a significant concern. However, as the fields of analytics and computing has shifted toward smart phones and mobile computing, Fujimoto urges the modeling and simulation community to keep pace by developing approaches focused on running simulations on mobile devices that interact with live data streams.
Fujimoto said, “We moved from a phase where analytics are no longer restricted to the scientists, engineers, or experts in an area. Now, analytics are being used by everyone and mobile devices are being used everywhere.”
“And my message to the simulation community is that modeling and simulation needs to be more widely used in mobile devices,” he said.
New Professor is Taking the Measure of Cybersecurity’s Toughest Problems
Cybercrime is one of the most pressing security threats today, but it’s almost impossible to detect. Yet new Assistant Professor Paul Pearce thinks measuring attacks is one of the first ways to better understand them and shutdown future threats.
“If we want to figure out how to effectively mitigate these threats, really understanding how they work is a core facet of that,” Pearce said. “That’s where my work is: designing methods and systems, and conducting studies to really understand these threats.”
Pearce’s research in this area earned a Special Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control Doctoral Dissertation Award Runner-Up honor at the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Computer and Communications Security in London last month.
Practical computer science
Pearce has always been interested in computers. Although he never had a chance to take classes in high school, he won several hacking competitions at community colleges he attended before transferring to University of California, Berkeley to study electrical engineering and computer science.
During his studies, he preferred research with practical applications, eventually discovering an interest in cybersecurity during his Ph.D. at Berkeley. Under his advisor, Professor Vern Paxson, Pearce joined the Center for Evidence-based Security Research, a research center that focuses on the economic and social motivations behind cybercrime.
“I gravitate toward stuff that has direct measurable impact in problems that are still important,” he said.
Combatting cybercrime
During his Ph.D., Pearce tackled some of the largest and most nebulous cybersecurity problems: cybercrime and censorship.
Cybercrime covers everything from denial of service attacks to malware. Despite its prevalence, cybercrime is difficult to recognize because the attackers’ goal is to make money as quickly as possible rather than using advanced tactics that are easier to trace.
Pearce’s research has focused on advertising abuse, such as bots that click on ads to make money for companies. Applying new hybrid tools to real-world situations, Pearce identified weak links in underground advertising abuse structures. Working with law enforcement and Microsoft, Pearce mitigated fraud in the network and helped take down one of the most prominent bots.
Measuring censorship
Censorship is an entirely different problem, but equally as complex as cybercrimes.
“In the cybercrime case, you know where to start,” Pearce said. “With censorship, though, how do you even know what to measure and where do measure it from?”
Compounding these issues, censorship is even more challenging to measure remotely, and even if there is one consistent source, that data may not be accurate.
To measure censorship, Pearce developed methods and layers of the network stack to be able to remotely infer censorship. By using common cybersecurity concepts such as side channels and checking manipulation of the Domain Name Servers (DNS) layer, Pearce was able to obtain measurements.
In the future, Pearce plans to continue this work here. With its strong cybersecurity department, Georgia Tech is the ideal place to pursue this research for Pearce, who joined the school in fall 2019.
Award Recognizes Professor's Impact on the Evolution of Online Learning
A longtime College of Computing professor is among the recently announced winners of 2020 Regents’ Awards for Teaching Excellence.
Ashok Goel will receive a Regents’ Award for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning from the University System of Georgia Board of Regents. The Regent’s Award for Goel recognizes his groundbreaking contributions to the evolution of online learning.
Goel and the other Regents’ Award winners, one of whom is also from Georgia Tech, are being honored as part of the Board of Regents’ upcoming Scholarship Gala, which is set for Feb. 21.
Widely known as creators of Jill Watson – the world’s first artificially intelligent (AI) teaching assistant – Goel and his Design and Intelligence Lab team continue to build upon the Jill platform to create next-generation AI tools that increase engagement, help retention, and improve learning outcomes for online teachers and learners.
[RELATED: A Teaching Assistant Named Jill Watson]
“We’re moving well beyond answering questions about a particular class and getting closer to developing AI technologies that can scale globally, work in tandem with other AIs, and truly be transformative for a broad spectrum of online learners,” said Goel, a professor in the School of Interactive Computing.
“I’m honored to receive a Regents’ Award and proud to accept it on behalf of the Design and Intelligence Lab.”
Under the team name, Emprize, Goel and his lab team are currently semifinalists in the $5 million IBM Watson Artificial Intelligence XPrize Initiative.

XPrize finalists will be announced in conjunction with an Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence conference in New York City next month.
This BioTrac Platform is Helping First Responders Stay Safe
After witnessing the intensity of the wildfires in Australia over the course of late 2019 and early 2020, it’s easy to see why firefighters need help gauging their vitals when working in extreme conditions for long periods.
“Overexertion injuries are the leading cause of injury for firefighters and can trigger cardiac events which comprise over half of the deaths in the field,” said Zack Braun, a current Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) student and co-founder of FireHUD, the first physiological monitoring device designed to mitigate the risk of overexertion.
Created by Braun and two other Georgia Tech graduates, FireHUD is a wearable technology that prevents heat stress by sending alerts to a cloud-based platform when a user has an abnormally high body temperature. The alert helps commanders keep track of their team’s vitals and gives them the ability to instruct users to seek safety before ever needing medical help.
The technology is currently used by firefighters in 12 departments with 120 FireHUD Bands now in use. Bolstered by a $750,000 grant from the National Science Foundation and a secondary grant with the United States Air Force, the startup is now looking to expand its reach and deliver 500 additional devices for military evaluation and use.
“FireHUD Bands require no configuration and will send alerts when necessary – allowing users to be notified before injuries occur, but to be able to focus on the task at hand,” said Braun.
Additionally, FireHUD’s design focuses on safety through customization by utilizing a machine learning algorithm that modifies its thresholds for individual users.
“We developed an algorithm for ‘exertion’ that quantifies the current state of physiological strain for each individual user. This exertion metric is a zero to 100 percent value that allows commanders to easily glean the current workload of each responder in their team — removing the need to know individual heart rate thresholds.”
A History in Georgia Tech Startup Programs
Braun was a year away from graduating with a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Georgia Tech’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) when a conversation with a family friend about firefighting safety concerns would instigate the launch of the startup.
“I came up with the original idea for a heads-up display after talking to a family friend at the Atlanta Fire Department. There I learned about firefighting in general as well as the lack of situational awareness that occurs in such a chaotic environment,” said Braun.
With this inspiration, Braun recruited the help of long-time friend and fellow ECE student, Tyler Sisk. Together, they joined Georgia Tech’s CREATE-X Idea-to-Prototype class as a means to work on the original prototype while earning class credit. The duo then won the InVenture Prize in 2016, a competition program that fosters entrepreneurial endeavors for undergraduate and recent graduates from Georgia Tech.
[Related News: FireHUD Wins the 2016 InVenture Prize]
With this recognition and funding under their belts, the team recruited fellow classmate, Joe Boettcher to join them. Over the course of their undergraduate academic careers, the team of three was involved in a number of additional Georgia Tech startup incubation programs including three CREATE-X courses and Startup Launch.
Braun said, “All three of these programs provided mentorship and support in order to develop FireHUD’s prototypes and launch the company upon graduation in December 2017. On our last day before graduation, we won a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the National Science Foundation to continue development full-time.”
Now, after graduating with their B.S. degrees from Georgia Tech, Braun and Boettcher are continuing their education as OMSCS students.
Understanding Firefighters’ Experiences
Thanks to the SBIR grant, the FireHUD team was able to rapidly prototype and send 30 heads-up display units to select fire departments to trial. However, they were met with mixed responses and pivoted their design to an arm band after the heads-up display was found to be distracting.
However, this was not the first time that wearable technology in firefighting has been met with mixed responses.
[Related News: Firefighters Have Mixed Response to Wearable Tech for Emergency Work]
“In parallel with these trials, we attended a conference called the National Fallen Firefighter Foundation (NFFF) Physiological Monitoring Technology Summit, which was crucial in pivoting the company towards a product that was more usable and adoptable. The keynote presentation given by a fire chief who talked about his department’s experience with physiological monitoring and the problems current physiological systems encounter,” said Braun.
Nine months later, the FireHUD team finished development of the first commercially viable physiological monitoring platform tailored to first responders which is now called the BioTrac Platform.
The BioTrac Platform is made up of three parts:
- the BioTrac Band, which is the wearable device,
- the BioTrac Gateway, which is the long-range radio transceiver,
- and the BioTrac Web Application, which is the real-time software dashboard.
The FireHUD developers are now working with a local contract manufacturer in Georgia to begin scaling the development for the BioTrac Platform’s hardware and plan to begin production by April 2020.
“We plan to sell to three markets that suffer injuries and deaths from heat stress and overexertion: first responders, the military, and industrial facilities,” said Braun.
New Computational Media Thread First to Cross Three Colleges
Georgia Tech’s Computational Media (CM) program is set to expand later this year with the launch of a new Music Technology curriculum. The new thread will available to CM undergraduates for the Fall 2020 semester.
First developed by the College of Computing at Georgia Tech in 2006, the Threads concept lets students combine computer science (CS) instruction with classes related to particular application areas.
Along with eight Threads for CS majors, the College of Computing currently partners with the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Design on three Threads for CM majors. With the addition of the new thread, CM majors now have four curricula to choose from – Film & Media Studies, Games, Interaction Design, and Music Technology, which they can combine with one of three CS Threads: People, Media, or Intelligence.
“This is a tremendous opportunity for our students. The new thread has some similarities to the existing music technology minor, but has more extensive coursework,” said Charles Isbell, dean of the College of Computing and John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
“This addition makes Computational Media not only the only Bachelor of Science degree program to cross colleges but the only one to cross more than two, bringing Computing together with both Liberal Arts and Design,” Isbell said.
An information session about computational media and the new music technology thread will take place on Jan. 16 at 11 a.m. in the College of Computing Building, room 155.
New Research Applies Theoretical Computer Science to the Brain
How does the human brain work? It's a question that has stymied scientists for centuries. For the past few years, College of Computing Professor Santosh Vempala has been exploring the question using theoretical computer science.
“This is one of the most fundamental questions in science,” Vempala said.
His starting point is the observation that the brain is able to do many things computers still cannot — and more reliably and robustly. For example, humans are great at pattern recognition and generalization, from identifying letters to walking on new surfaces, after just a few “training” examples.
A particularly striking example is language. After hearing relatively few sentences, a neurotypical 2-year-old can understand and generate virtually infinite correct sentences.
“How is the brain able to do this?” Vempala asks. “How does the mind emerge from the brain? From neurons and synapses, how do we get to perception, language, and stories?”
Computers, however, need a lot of data and computational power, and work only in limited settings — at least for now. This is why Captchas became popular for keeping applications secure.
[RELATED: Real-Time Captcha Technique Improves Biometric Authentication]
While machine learning is interested in using insights from the brain, it mostly examines it from a data perspective. Vempala, however, wants to develop an algorithmic theory of brain function. He plans to approach this at an intermediate scale that is higher than neurons and synapses, but doesn’t examine the brain as a whole.
Vempala and Columbia Professor Christos Papadimitriou hypothesize that assemblies of large, densely inter-connected neurons are the engine of brain computation. Assemblies are a strong basis for a computational system because they can be used to perform higher-level operations while at the same time can be compiled down to tangible units, such as neurons and synapses.
This has been an ongoing project. In the Spring of 2018, they co-organized a Simons Institute semester The Brain and Computation. In recent work, assemblies have been shown to be able to explain several experimental findings by neuroscientists.
Their research, currently funded by a $500,000 National Science Foundation grant, will develop a theory to understand how the brain functions from a computational perspective. This is a collaborative effort with computer scientists at Columbia and cognitive scientists at City University of New York who will also contribute experimental studies.
The research addresses the assembly hypothesis through five goals:
- Expanding modeling and mathematical techniques of analysis for the study of assembly computation
- Developing more accurate and efficient simulation methodology
- Exploring assemblies’ computational power through new modes outside formal computation, such as pattern completion, learning, and prediction
- Modeling and algorithmic investigation of how synaptic connectivity dynamics and biases of affect the various modes of brain computation
- Creating and analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments and electrocorticography data through new algorithmic and machine learning techniques
Machine Learning Examines Effects of Sea Levels Rising to Help Communities Plan Better for Future Generations
With Australia continuing to burn, increases in floods and other natural disasters around the world, it is no surprise that researchers are looking for new ways to explore the effects of climate change on human populations.
Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, collaborating with the University of Southern California and the University of Waterloo, recently published a paper that looks into the impacts of sea-level rise on human migration. The paper, “Modeling Migration Patterns in the USA Under Sea Level Rise”, proposes a framework to couple sea level rise models with human migration models so that researchers can see the indirect effects of rising sea levels on human populations.
“Traditionally sea level rise has been talked about in terms of the number of people on the coastline that will be affected, how many homes may be flooded, and how day-to-day activities may be disrupted. But in our modeling we can see the effects go much further beyond just the coast,” said Georgia Tech Ph.D. student and lead author Caleb Robinson.
Previous work in this area has mainly explored existing migration pathways, like people moving from New York City to Los Angeles. This new research looks into pathways between counties and cities that previously might not exist. For example, Atlanta and Dallas are becoming inland cities that many coastal residents migrate to, while they were not previously thought of as cities affected by rising sea levels.
Using History to Better Predict the Future
Researchers used historical migration data from 2005 and 2006 after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita nearly destroyed the city of New Orleans. Both of the hurricanes resulted in mass flooding across several counties, resulting in an outpouring of migrants. Using machine learning, researchers were able to better understand people’s moving patterns and build a separate model for people impacted by similar scenarios of forced migration compared to regular migration patterns.
They combined this model with future estimates of the human population and sea-level rise in 2100 to look at what areas might be underwater and better understand where the affected people from these areas might go.
"Our study emphasizes that modeling and understanding better forced migration dynamics is key to more accurately estimating the more global ripple effects of sea-level rise," says University of Southern California assistant professor Bistra Dilkina, who is the corresponding author of the study.
Understanding Patterns Leads to Better Planning
Robinson emphasized that while this work is a huge step in the right direction, they built the framework so that it could be continued to be refined upon by other researchers.
“Our framework allows others to plug in different information like population projections that will allow researchers to develop more complicated and better-understood models. If that happens, we can all continue to update our results and make even better predictions and assessments,” said Robinson.
The researchers hope that their work will not only lead to more research being done in this area and lead to more people understanding other effects of climate change but that it will also help city planners better plan for shifting migration patterns in the future.
Understanding this data will hopefully help coastal cities increase funding for sea walls and other measures so that there will be fewer homes destroyed by a flood, or for other inland cities to reconsider how they are structuring their transportation options.
The paper and more of its findings will be published in the latest issue of PLOS ONE in January 2020.
CRNCH Brings Together Researchers Across Computing at Annual Summit
The Center for Research Into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH) hosts its third summit on Jan. 31.
This annual gathering has become one of the top forums to discuss the future of computing after Moore’s law, the past industry-wide trend of doubling transistors in a microchip nearly every two years that exponentially fueled computing innovation. Now dozens of experts will meet to discuss computing’s new frontier from the perspective of diverse areas including devices, edge computing, computer architecture, systems software, machine learning, quantum computing, and theory.
“The CRNCH Summit is an exciting opportunity for Georgia Tech researchers and our visitors to share their latest breakthrough ideas for post-Moore computing,” said CRNCH Co-Director Vivek Sarkar. “We look forward to a productive meeting, and all the great research that will follow.”
This year’s keynote is on computer architecture by David Mountain, the senior technical director at Advanced Computing Systems Research Program. Other leaders in their field follow, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory AI Institute Director David Womble, Notre Dame Professor Peter Kogge, National Instruments Academic Business Development Manager Igor Alvarado, Northrop Grumman System Architect Brian Konigsburg, and GTRI Quantum Systems Division Senior Research Scientist Craig Clark.
The event is also a chance for Georgia Tech faculty to showcase their research. School of Computer Science (SCS) Associate Professor Ada Gavrilovska discusses edge computing possibilities. SCS Professor Dana Randall offers emergent computation as a possibility. SCS Associate Professor Hyesoon Kim presents heterogeneous computing systems. School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Professors Arijit Raychowdhury and Moin Qureshi bring their perspectives on future devices and quantum computers.
The event highlights how CRNCH’s influence spans the entire institute with more than 30 dedicated faculty members from the College of Computing, the College of Engineering, the College of Sciences, and the Georgia Tech Research Institute. With their expertise in quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, design science, approximate computing, and more, CRNCH’s team is uniquely qualified to tackle the challenges of computing’s future. Since it was founded in 2017 by Co-director Tom Conte, the center has paired researchers with funding, students with internships, companies with research labs on campus to test their leading-edge products, and even started a collection of specialized hardware called the Rogues Gallery (RG).
The RG has supported close to 75 users with a quarter coming from external labs and institutions. In 2019, co-directors Jason Riedy and Jeff Young also ran external tutorials at the ASPLOS and PEARC conferences and presented RG-related work at multiple venues including SIAM CSE, PEARC, and ICRC. Looking forward, Young expects more challenging projects.
“In 2020, the Rogues Gallery will see the deployment of additional hardware focused on Arm high-performance computing as well as new neuromorphic prototypes and support for quantum programming” he said. “We’re looking to support a more diverse set of research hardware as well as a more inclusive userbase to tackle the toughest challenges in post-Moore computing”
Team Makes Semifinals in Global AI Competition
The Georgia Tech research team behind the world’s first artificially intelligent (AI) teaching assistant is one step closer to winning the $5 million IBM Watson AI XPRIZE competition.
Led by College of Computing Professor Ashok Goel, team Emprize is among 10 semifinalists announced this week remaining in the global competition. The teams are vying for a top prize of $3 million.
The IBM AI XPRIZE is a multi-year competition that started in 2016 with 147 teams. The competition highlights the power of human and AI collaboration to solve real-world challenges.
The Emprize team’s entry is based on the Jill Watson platform first developed as an AI teaching assistant (TA) supporting Georgia Tech’s groundbreaking Online Master of Science in Computer Science program. The entry includes other AI-learning agents developed by the team currently deployed in online and residential courses.
According to Goel, these next-generation AI tools are designed to increase engagement, help retention, and improve learning outcomes for online teachers and learners.

“We’re moving well beyond answering questions about a particular class and getting closer to developing AI technologies that can scale globally, work in tandem with other AIs, and truly be transformative for a broad spectrum of online learners,” said Goel in a recent interview.
Finalists for the XPRIZE will be announced in February with the winner expected to be announced in April. The second-place team will earn $1 million. The third-place team will win $500,000. The remaining $500,000 has been given out to teams as milestone awards.
Changing the Conversation: Georgia Tech Researchers Provide New Approach to Automated Story Generation
It’s a situation familiar to anyone who’s ever communicated with a voice assistant on a smart device. You pose a request: “Hey Voice Assistant, tell me a story about Georgia Tech.” More often than not, you get a related response – “Georgia Tech is located in Atlanta, Georgia. Would you like me to provide you with directions?” – but one with slightly unnatural language and only limited information.
Despite the enormous strides made in artificial intelligence to develop systems that can answer simple questions and requests, the kinds of natural conversational language humans have with each other when giving more complex directions or telling stories has thus far been out of reach.
Research from Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing, however, provides a novel approach that improves the combination of automated story generation with natural language. The development is an important step in providing AI assistants the capability to more naturally converse with humans.
“Let’s think of a future version of Siri or Alexa, where you have a complex task that’s not just ‘Look this thing up on the internet,’ or ‘Tell me what the weather is outside,’” said Mark Riedl, an associate professor at Georgia Tech and the faculty lead on the research. “Maybe you want to plan your day or a birthday party. Think of the response like a little story, a narrative that conveys the requested information.
“It’s a missing capability in AI – they just don’t understand us or communicate with us in the same ways that we understand each other.”
Riedl and his team approached the challenge by viewing the exchange of information as stories – a series of events, one after the other, that leads to some conclusion. Past research on the topic identified patterns in language to identify how stories are constructed – namely that a verb generally changes the action and conveys a new event in a story.
“By boiling down these stories drawn from the internet to essential verbs and actions, we can extract patterns from stories better,” Riedl said. “There are a lot of ways to talk about marriage, but at the end of the day someone is marrying someone else.”
This paper, the third in the series, took the next step: If you take away all the words to identify the patterns in a story, you need to be able to put them back in naturally and intelligently in a way that humans are accustomed to. Put simply, it’s like building an outline and then filling in the details.
The system works by building the outline through a neural network trained on sequencing events. With the help of story examples drawn from the internet, it applies machine learning to produce a series of events, one leading to the most likely next outcome. That outline guides a second neural network that applies natural language – grammar, syntax, spelling, everything else you need to make the story intelligible – to produce more elaborate sentences.
“If you’re asking for directions for how a birthday party should go, you don’t want just ‘Jill eats cake; Jill opens presents,’” Riedl said. “You want something more akin to the stories we share as humans. It’s actually more difficult for us to process information when it’s delivered in a way we’re not accustomed to.”
The researchers found that an ensemble approach works the best. They use a series of five algorithms, each with different capabilities in accuracy and natural language generation, produces the best stories. Because one algorithm isn’t uniformly better at all aspects of the task, it will be run through all five to find the highest confidence level of the sentence.
“One technique might provide bland sentences, but is accurate with the actual content,” Riedl said. “Another might be very good at putting in a narrative flourish, but they fail more often. You want that nicer sentence, but you also want it to be able to catch mistakes in the content.”
The ensemble approach scored significantly higher in human studies than the individual algorithms alone. Human trust in their AI and robot assistants, Riedl said, was key to adoption in the future.
“The key is that you want to place that trust in your machine counterpart, but it has to earn that trust on correctness and accuracy,” he said.
The paper is titled Story Realization: Expanding Plot Events into Sentences, and will be presented at the 34th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence on Feb. 7-12 in New York City. The research is funded under a grant from DARPA.
Fellowship Recognizes Underrepresented Minorities and Entrepreneurs in OMSCS
When Henry Shi finished the Online Master of Science Computer Science (OMSCS) in 2018, he wanted to give back to the program that fostered his entrepreneurial spirit.
Now his travel startup, SnapTravel, offers two $1,000 fellowships recognizing entrepreneurs and underrepresented minorities in tech. This year’s winners are Rodrigo De Luna Lara and Aadil Jaleel Choudhry.
“This year's applicants have come from all corners of the world, including developing and developed countries, from West Africa to Central Asia to South America to the middle of America, and is a true testament to Georgia Tech’s expanding mission and global impact,” Shi said.
De Luna Lara received the underrepresented minority in STEM award meant for students “pursuing their OMSCS degree and identifies as a member of an underrepresented group in STEM; namely one who identified as a women, non-binary, Indigenous, Black, Hispanic and/or Latinx.” As a Latino bisexual person who identifies as non-binary and works in data science, De Luna Laura knows how little representation some groups have in STEM.
“There are still people who doubt the technical capacity I have as a Latino in a field like data science,” De Luna Lara said. “Throughout my career, I’ve shown that belonging to an underrepresented group doesn’t mean I’m less capable, and the position I’m in has enabled me to be a promoter for STEM in these groups.”
De Luna Lara provides workshops to empower young girls to join STEM careers in Mexico and plans to use the OMSCS degree to increase representation.
“I hope I will be able to inspire young people who don’t feel part of the mainstream to open up and embrace who they are and not let that interfere with their careers but instead use that to boost their career,” De Luna Lara said.
SnapTravel gave the entrepreneurial spirit award intended for students “pursuing their OMSCS degree while founding their own startup, or pursuing other entrepreneurial activities” to Choudhry. As the chief technology officer and founder of 11-person startup automotive startup Sedenius Technologies in Pakistan, Choudhry is balancing a lot with OMSCS.
“I am from Pakistan, where the startup ecosystem is still in its initial stages,” Choudhry said. “I quit my stable job for my startup and failed twice before I got a startup running.”
Ultimately supporting students like this is why Shi believes in OMSCS and became the first to offer a fellowship like this.
GT Computing Student Plans to Study Connections Between Law and Machine Learning as a J.P. Morgan Ph.D. Fellow
Recognized for his exceptional talent for using artificial intelligence (AI) to solve real-world problems, machine learning Ph.D. student Ashwin Vijayakumar has been named a 2020 recipient of the prestigious J.P. Morgan Ph.D. Fellowship.
Vijayakumar typically studies how to develop machine-learning solutions for assistive technology and focuses on improving reasoning systems, modeling human preferences, and producing diverse outputs.
However, with the funds from the fellowship, Vijayakumar plans to pivot and explore the relationship between machine learning and law.
“With machine learning still being relatively new, there are a lot of questions surrounding its impact legally. I want to dive into that and hopefully discover some connections that will make a broad impact. I wouldn’t be able to explore this new area without J.P. Morgan’s support,” said Vijayakumar, who is advised by School of Interactive Computing associate professor Dhruv Batra.
As a leading financial institution, J.P. Morgan is keen on collaborating with academia on ways to use AI to create better solutions, better protect their customers, and create better products. The awards are a part of the company’s $10 billion-plus annual investment in technology and innovation.
“Our goal is to recognize and enable the next generation of leading AI researchers. We want to create an environment where researchers can inspire change and make a lasting impact in our communities and across our industry,” said Manuela Veloso, head of J.P. Morgan AI Research.
The fellowship begins in fall 2020, granting Vijayakumar $100,000 to be used for tuition with a stipend and travel expenses for technical conferences.
Georgia Tech Dominates at Premier Conference for Parallel Processing
The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) is a leading international community that aims to integrate mathematics with science and technology to create solutions to real-world problems through conferences, publications, and workshops. Its premier conference for the exchange of updates and best practices in the field of parallel processing research, SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing 2020 (PP20), begins today in Seattle, Washington and will run until Saturday, February 15.
Georgia Tech leads this year’s conference presence with 28 different forms of engagement from 25 researchers across units including the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), School of Computer Science (SCS), and the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI).
Georgia Tech’s presence includes an invited plenary talk by SCS Associate Professor Hyesoon Kim that discusses different ways to apply and evaluate modeling techniques for heterogeneous computing systems; a poster presentation by GTRI researchers Micah E. Halter, Kun Cao, and James Fairbanks that proposes a theory-based framework to facilitate a more ideal workflow in scientific development processes; and a presentation by CSE Professor Ümit Çatalyürek and Ph.D. student Abdurrahman Yasar at the SIAM Workshop on Combinatorial Scientific Computing, which is co-located with SIAM PP.
“The SIAM conference series as a whole is fantastic because its content is focused on peoples' latest work rather than published technical papers. Because of this content focus, SIAM PP's sessions can create more interaction and spawn new ideas,” said Senior Research Scientist Jason Riedy who is set to present at several sessions throughout the week, including one session focused on providing updates from the Rogues Gallery.
The Rogues Gallery is a test bed established by Georgia Tech’s Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH). The project was initiated in an effort to develop an understanding of next-generation hardware, with an emphasis on unorthodox and uncommon technologies.
Other notable tracks in which Georgia Tech researchers are both organizers and presenters include:

Startup is Remixing How Musicians Connect and Collaborate
With a steady rise in the number of independent artists and more musicians demanding more ownership of their work, collaboration and community have never been more crucial for up and coming artists in the music industry.
Georgia Tech students Abhinav Goyal and Saribek (Bek) Hovakimian are working on a platform that could help aspiring musicians build both. Passionate about music, these second-year computer science majors have co-founded the music startup 808, a project they have cultivated through Georgia Tech’s CREATE-X startup programs.
808 might be viewed as a mashup of LinkedIn and Fiverr - which build job networks and support professionals with particular skills. Its goal is to help musicians, songwriters, producers, engineers, and managers connect and collaborate on projects.
“Our mission is to revolutionize the music industry. The way the industry currently works, some people feel like they have to steal a song or give a producer less credit than they deserve, or that signing a deal with a major label is the only way to succeed,” said Goyal. “We want to enable people to find a community, own their work, and make great art together instead of going it alone.”
[VIDEO: 808 Pitch From 2019 Create-X Demo Day]
808 is still in development and likely won’t launch its mobile or website app for at least another year. When the platform is ready, artists will be able to search profiles of other artists near them, listen to their beats or vocals, and find someone who is the right match for their project. Ultimately, the developers would like the platform to encourage artists from around the world to collaborate with each other.
When they’re not developing code for the platform itself, Goyal and Hovakimian are hard at work connecting artists and building awareness for their startup.
By attending performances around Atlanta, hosting networking events at CREATE-X’s headquarters and studio sessions at Patchwerk Recording Studios – a favorite of Beyoncé, Outkast, and Akon – Hovakimian and Goyal are developing relationships with their future users. So far, 808 has hosted three studio sessions at Patchwerk with around 30 artists collaborating on new music. Their first song, Scary Movie, was recently released on Soundcloud.
Peace Up A-Town Down
Hip-hop is the number one music genre in the world right now, and one-third of the music streamed in 2018 was hip-hop or rap. With these trends in mind, Goyal and Hovakimian felt that focusing on underground hip-hop would be the right entry point into the market.
“Colleges are always fertile ground for music, so even though Georgia Tech is more of a technical school, we still feel like we have a good opportunity to introduce our artists to more fans and create more of a music culture on campus,” said Goyal.
Nailing down a market entry point and learning how to create a successful business was a challenge, but the pair received great advice from Joyelle Harris, associate director of the CREATE-X LEARN program.
“She’s works with a lot of start-ups and also has an engineering background so she really knows both sides of what we’re trying to do. She’s been a great coach and has been very generous with her time,” said Hovakimian.
Embracing the Entrepreneurial Spirit
When they met as freshmen in their dorm, Goyal and Hovakimian had no idea that they would form a company later that year. So far, they have learned a lot about themselves and what it takes to build a company from the ground up.
“As a co-founder, it’s really interesting to see how you’re touching all of the different aspects of a business and how much is needed to get something off the ground. Sometimes I’m working on marketing, or sales, or developing the platform…it’s been a fun journey so far,” said Hovakimian.
For Goyal, entrepreneurship is his passion but he feels that having a computer science degree will benefit him in the long run.
“I’ve been coding since I was a kid, but I’m realizing how much I can do with those skills. I have a lot of ideas on how to change music, sports, and finance, but it’s computer science that brings those ideas to life,” said Goyal.
The company name is a common nickname for an electronic drum machine, the Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer that was popular in the 1980s. It was one of the first programmable drum machines and it eventually changed the sound of pop music. Goyal and Hovakimian hope that their version of 808 once again makes a key change in the music industry.
Tech Team to Compete in Championship This Week
Get your cheer gear and your resume ready to go. This week, a team of Georgia Tech students is vying for the title in the first-ever North America Championship of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC).
Top collegiate computing students from across the United States and Canada are pouring into Atlanta to take on Georgia Tech 5 (GT 5) in the algorithmic programming competition. The event is Saturday at the Georgia World Congress Center (GWCC), from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. It’s free and open to the public.
Nearly 60 teams are competing in the inaugural continental championship. The winning team, along with the 2019 regional winners, will advance to the 44th Annual ICPC World Final, which is being held in Moscow, Russia, June 21 through 26.
[RELATED: Top Student Programmers Heading to Atlanta for Shot at World Finals]
As winners of the ICPC 2019 southeast regional qualifier held last November, GT 5 – computer science major Animesh Fatehpuria and Ph.D. students Li Chen and Yu Gao – is guaranteed a shot at the world title.
The inaugural ICPC North America Championship is hosted by Georgia Tech’s College of Computing, which is also set to host the championship in 2021 and 2022.
“When the ICPC contacted us last year about hosting the new championship, we were eager to volunteer because we believe in the worth of the contest and know the value of creativity, teamwork, and performance under pressure,” said College of Computing Dean Charles Isbell.
“We’re excited at the opportunity to bring some of the best young minds in computing to our campus to see what we–and the city of Atlanta–have to offer.”
Along with the championship competition on Saturday, the teams will participate in a cybersecurity challenge hosted by the National Security Administration (NSA), a visit to the World of Coca-Cola, a sponsors’ showcase, and more.
The Tech community is encouraged to cheer for GT 5 during the championship competition on Saturday. Along with this, students are invited to meet with event sponsors at the GWCC Thursday from 12 to 5 p.m. Sponsors include NSA, IBM, Universal Parks and Resorts, SpaceX, and more.
The ICPC is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. The ICPC operates under the auspices of the ICPC Foundation, which was founded to advance the art and sport of competitive programming for the benefit of society. More than 320,000 students have competed in ICPC since it began in 1970. In 2018, nearly 53,000 students from more than 3,200 universities in 110 countries participated in ICPC events.
Mark Borodovsky Elected as ISCB Fellow
Mark Borodovsky, Regents’ Professor at the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering and School of Computational Science and Engineering, was distinguished for his influential research in developing algorithms of genome analysis as well as his recognized leadership in education and community development. He is one of twelve ISCB Fellows elected in the Class of 2020.
Bioinformatics is a strategic discipline at the frontier between molecular biology and computer science, impacting numerous branches of biological science, genomics-based biotechnology, computational and AI based medicine, as well as public health. For instance, the contemporary drug-discovery paradigm driving research and development in pharmaceutical companies, is relying heavily on bioinformatics research and analysis that deals with massive quantities of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data.
Borodovsky is best known for his work on gene finding algorithms which are used widely (see http://exon.gatech.edu/GeneMark). He is also responsible for launching the interdisciplinary Bioinformatics Master and Ph.D. programs at Georgia Tech.
He is the first faculty member at Georgia Tech (indeed in the state of Georgia for that matter) to become ISCB Fellow.

Researchers Find New Security Problem in Hardware Power Systems
Passwords can be stolen just by monitoring unintentional electromagnetic emanations from a computer’s power management unit (PMU). Georgia Tech researchers discovered this new side-channel attack that can be used to extract sensitive data even if the attacker is 10 feet away or even separated by a wall.
“In the past five years, researchers are showing a lot of different vulnerabilities in hardware,” School of Computer Science Ph.D. student Nader Sehatbakhsh said. “Power management units are just one of many different hardware components that can leak secrets.”
The Power Problem
While computer power used to be a simple on-off switch, new PMUs operate in up to 10 different states to preserve energy. Researchers found that each state emits a different electromagnetic signal that creates spikes in the frequency-domain spectrum, and as the activity increases so does the signal and the spikes.
Typing characters creates periods of high-state activities in which the distance between state spikes can show the location of keys on a keyboard. With the right monitoring, an attacker can determine the number of characters or how many words are in a password, or even find the exact characters.
This type of monitoring is called a side-channel attack, in which an attacker can extract sensitive data from physical signals produced by electronic activity within the device. Sound, temperature, power, and electromagnetic waves are common signals.
[RELATED: Researchers Help Close Security Hole in Popular Encryption Software]
PMU side-channel attacks can also be exploited to create a fast and stealthy covert communication. For example, a rogue employee could extract data outside of a secured company’s computer, breaking existing security.
Stopping the Side-channel
Side-channel vulnerabilities are becoming more pervasive because security is not the first priority for hardware designers, according to Sehatbakhsh. Their primary goals are to create something fast and cost-effective, and security often slows down the process and becomes more expensive. Yet with more research like this, things could change, Sehatbakhsh said.
“Now people are demanding extra security, so hopefully ignoring these vulnerabilities won’t be an option in the future.”
At this point in their work, the researchers are mostly exposing the problem, but there are potential solutions, Sehatbakhsh suggested. Adding randomness to the PMU would unsync power states from the data they provide; however, this solution might consume too much power for developers to implement it.
Sehatbakhsh will present the research at the 26th International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture in San Diego from Feb. 22 to 26. He co-wrote the paper with School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Ph.D. student Baki Berkay Yilmaz, ECE Associate Professor Alenka Zajic, and SCS Professor Milos Prvulovic.
Georgia Tech Researchers Develop New Tool to Preserve Crash Report Privacy
When a user opts to send a crash report following a program failure, the report could share personal information including usernames, passwords, and other confidential details.
This is why Georgia Tech researchers created a new tool called Desensitization that generates crash reports that preserve the original error — whether a bug or an attack — without exposing privacy. The method is also smaller than half of all crash reports, taking less than 15 seconds to process and significantly saving resources for both users and developers.
“Crash dumps can have a severe outcome, including sensitive information leaking from end users, bad publicity, and financial liability for developers if a data breach happens,” said School of Computer Science Ph.D. student Ren Ding. “We came up with the idea to desensitize crashes while keeping necessary attack payloads before sharing it to the developers.”
Desensitization is effective at removing more than 80 percent of potential sensitive data from Linux crash reports and nearly 50 percent of Windows crash reports.
The problem with crash reports
Crash reports usually include a coredump file that contains the central processing unit context and memory of the program, or the program inputs that made it crash. Both can include sensitive data, from session tokens to personal contact information.
Previous techniques to remove this type of data weren’t effective. Relying on developers to hand-annotate the data is time consuming and error prone. Another method that uses a pattern-based search to identify private data, such as email addresses, doesn’t work on program-specific data. The biggest issue with both methods is how much computation they require.
How Desensitization works
In contrast, Desensitization first runs on the user side to decouple general information and crash evidence from personal data. The order is strategic, according to Ding. End users may not have as much computation power as developers, so debugging and analysis isn’t efficient at the source.
It’s imperative to minimize necessary resources such as time and memory, making the program “lightweight.” The goal, said Ding, is to extract enough general information so developers can conduct the crash diagnostics on their end. Once the tool extracts the attack information from the user, it’s sent to the server for more thorough analysis.
The researchers’ method is bug and attack oriented to ensure the tool only focuses on relevant data. With this in mind, they designed one general and four lightweight techniques.
The general technique scans the memory to identify all pointers, a programming language object that stores memory and where most attacks reside. The four other techniques either identify specific information or customize existing techniques in prominent bugs and attacks.
“Our security model relies on the security guarantee of previous detection methods,” Ding said. “That’s why we try to make the current framework customizable by adopting the module design so that it can support more in the future.”
The module design of Desensitization makes the tool easy to apply to future technique and works on existing crash report analysis formats.
The solution is available to developers via Github.
Ding will present the research at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) in San Diego running from Feb. 23 through 26. He co-wrote the paper, Desensitization: Privacy-Aware and Attack-Preserving Crash Reports, with fellow SCS Ph.D. students Hong Hu and Wen Xu and Associate Professor Taesoo Kim.
Meet CSE: Ph.D. Student David Betancourt is Designing AI to Help Us Monitor the Real and Surreal World
The School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) offers a uniquely interdisciplinary pool of student researchers who specialize in bridging software and hardware together with real-world applications ranging from bioinformatics to cybersecurity and more.
Today, we’d like to introduce you to David Betancourt, a CSE Ph.D. student and machine learning scientist with a passion for developing methods for artificial intelligence (AI) to act in real-life safety-critical situations.
Betancourt’s research has applications in a wide range of areas including physical infrastructure systems, finance, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. When he is not working on his Ph.D. thesis or appreciating surrealist art, Betancourt serves as the chief scientist at Vorstella, a tech startup using AI to stabilize and optimize cloud infrastructure systems.

Tell us about your research interests.
I work in machine learning, uncertainty modeling, and numerical methods. The main goal of my research is to develop artificial intelligence that can reason and adapt under uncertainty in order to make AI safer.
How is uncertainty modeling research applied in the real world?
In most real-world applications, you have streams of data that contain significant uncertainty. One of the main problems in machine learning is that most times the data is far from being ready for learning---the data is unstructured, unlabeled, a large amount is missing, and exposed to uncertainty for multiple sources. In machine learning, we are used to data cleaning and data wrangling but less used to modeling the uncertainty in the data and in the models, especially if the source of uncertainty is more than randomness. As AI and machine learning make their way to more safety-critical real-world applications, obtaining reliable predictions is a necessity. Uncertainty modeling for machine learning seeks to make systems depending on AI safer, less risky, less biased, and more reliable.
It sounds like uncertainty modeling may help us more than we are aware of. Can you give us an example of how this is important and how your research is applied in this area?
Sure. For example, infrastructure systems, both physical and virtual, are essential to our society. One of the things that we are working on in our lab is connecting my research in machine learning and uncertainty modeling with structural health monitoring of public infrastructure to assess the real-time integrity of, for example, important bridges and tunnels.
With AI hardware and our algorithms in place, we can enhance the ability for monitoring systems to detect anomalies in real-time which alerts the engineers and other decision-makers in charge of a given infrastructure system that there is something wrong with it.
With more than 47,000 bridges in the United States being currently structurally deficient, your work may impact the entire country in a very tangible way. What type of hardware is your research using to help notify us of these bridges in need of repair?
That is indeed a huge concern. In that case, the main hardware consists of MEMS accelerometers which measure the forced and free vibrations of the system along with complementary environmental sensors that measure temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. They are placed on different parts of the bridge system and are then used to detect and identify various types of damage [by measuring acceleration forces]. Although the basic sensors have been around for years most of the detection has unfortunately been post-hoc or even forensic by using multiple models of the systems. Instead, my research focuses on using machine learning to make anomaly detections in real-time using solely sensor data, while including uncertainty in the inputs and predictions. This can save lives and billions of tax-payer dollars.
Actually, this area is broadly known as activity recognition. For example, these sensors are very similar to the wearable accelerometers that are used to monitor Parkinson’s disease! In the case of Parkinson’s, you can detect activity that is anomalous and then based on that activity, you can customize the patient’s medical treatment. This is why interdisciplinary research is so important.
Can you tell us about the startup you are currently working in and what your role is there?
I am the chief scientist at a startup called Vorstella. We concentrate on AI monitoring for distributed systems on the cloud and we are developing machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies and optimize the cloud infrastructure of large companies. Without an AI detection system like ours, when the cloud systems fail, it can be very chaotic for the IT team to bring the system back up in a short amount of time. This is especially true if we’re talking about a hospital or a large payment network. As complexity in cloud computing infrastructure increases, it becomes necessary to bring AI to help you.
Why did you choose to come to Georgia Tech?
I’ve been Georgia Tech all the way! I came here for my undergrad and after getting my master’s in engineering I took a break for a few years to work as an R&D engineer and entrepreneur and then came back for my Ph.D. in CSE. I chose to come back to Georgia Tech because of the interdisciplinary collaboration between computing, engineering, and math. I checked multiple departments in the U.S. and CSE is the best PhD program when it comes to that collaboration.
Last, but certainly not least. What is an interesting fact about yourself?
I like to research the lives and motivations of a few artists and literary movements, kind of like a historian. Salvador Dalí and Leonard Cohen are at the top of my list. Depending on whom, I like to read their books, see their art in person, listen to their music, collect vinyl records, and visit their old homes and museums. There is a strong connection that you can make with people who enjoy the same artist and I’m fortunate to have friends who do.
Improving Safety and Well-being on the Web and in Society
Most of our social interactions, most of our information needs, and most of our daily tasks and decision making is happening online.
With high-stakes decisions being made via the web, the ways in which malicious users engage with us online can have a profoundly negative impact on our lives and on society as a whole.
For Srijan Kumar, a new assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering, this is a concept that transcends social media, encompassing most, if not all, of the web and society. His research group, CLAWS (the Computational Lab for the Web and Society), was established with the goal of improving the safety and well-being of people world-wide. This is achieved by ridding the user experience of digital abuse and disinformation pitfalls, and using the online social signals to forecast harmful real-world events, such as mass shootings.
“Broadly, my group’s research is in data science and applied machine learning and we create the next generation of algorithms to understand and improve how users behave online and how it impacts the society,” said Kumar.
Understanding and Impacting Online Behavior
These next-generation algorithms that Kumar references are used to understand and forecast deceptive behavior that attempts to manipulate and misinform users. Instances in which these behaviors occur are vast, and can, according to Kumar, be categorized based on the three areas of use that they impact.
“There are three major things people do online: interact with one another, consume information, and act on the recommendations they are shown. A way to unify and transform the user experience is to develop the user models, which are deep-learning and network-based models”, he said.
Of course, this is more simply said than done. As one stride is made to improve user interactions, there are bad actors on the other side that are continuously attempting to manipulate user sessions in all three categories: trolls harass others, disinformation misleads and radicalizes people, and recommender systems are manipulated for financial, political, and ideological gains. A key challenge being solved at CLAWS is how to create algorithms that can forecast how malicious agents will behave in the future and develop algorithms that are robust to the creative attacks of malicious agents.
According to the Pew Research Center, 41 percent of the population report being harassed online at some time, making it easily the most recognizable form of online abuse that Kumar’s research attempts to address.
More than Harassment
However, the applications of Kumar’s work stretch far beyond harassment and his anti-abuse algorithms have been used by the likes of Flipkart, India’s largest E-commerce platform, and Wikipedia.
According to Pageviews Analysis, Wikipedia has aggregated over 420 billion views since July 2015 and deletes approximately 1,000 pages each day. These staggering numbers show the magnitude of the online encyclopedia giant and the reach of its platform despite wavering credibility of some pages. Compounded with the fact that younger audiences largely get their information from the web rather than traditional news outlets, this platform’s content and reach arguably impacts society.
“[Digital abuse] is a huge issue because everyone uses web platforms, such as Wikipedia and YouTube, even my nephew, who is six years old. And there are malicious actors on these platforms that are trying to manipulate the information,” Kumar said.
In an effort to find these malicious users and prevent misinformation, Wikipedia recruited the help of Kumar to detect fabricated articles using a machine learning model that could help identify the hoaxes.
“The surprising part about the study was that when respondents were asked to identify which were fake and which were real, people only had 66 percent accuracy – and that was after we told them that one was fake. So, the numbers for recognizing the fake without the context would likely be much different. Whereas, the machine learning models that we built had 86 percent accuracy of identifying the fake articles,” he said.
A Digital Native’s Inspiration
For Kumar, who grew up in the age of technology and social media, his passion for this field began with a frustration many of us have encountered: Buying an item off of the internet to find it was nothing like what we were promised.
“I had a first-hand experience of being misinformed and this made me become interested in pursuing it as a researcher because I realized that it affects millions of people.”
Now, after joining Georgia Tech in January 2020, Kumar is establishing the new CLAWS lab at the institute in an effort to continue growing this field and prevent more instances of online abuse from occurring in the future. Some applications of their work include:
- Health, such as detecting and countering health misinformation,
- Security, such as predicting mass shootings,
- Finance, such as predicting fraud and money laundering, and
- Social media, such as preventing disinformation and hate.
Kumar said, “We need new methods and new techniques to improve the interactions between users online. Right now, we are at the perfect scientific time to create these new models. And the reason is because earlier we were looking at the basics of how and what people were doing. But today, with deep learning and with new models available, we are able to create and transform these user experiences and fuel real-time and personalized systems.”
Prior to Georgia Tech, Kumar was visiting research scientist at Google AI, and a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. He is the recipient of the 2018 ACM SIGKDD Doctoral Dissertation Award runner-up, WWW 2017 Best Paper Award runner-up, Larry S. Davis Doctoral Dissertation Award 2017, and Dr. BC Roy Gold Medal.
Machine Learning Tool May Help Us Better Understand RNA Viruses
E2Efold is an end-to-end deep learning model developed at Georgia Tech that can predict RNA secondary structures, an important task used in virus analysis, drug design, and other public health applications.
Although the model has yet to be used in real-life applications, in research testing it has shown at least a 10 percent improvement in structure prediction accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods according to Xinshi Chen, a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student specializing in machine learning and co-developer of the new tool.
“The model uses an unrolled algorithm for solving a constrained optimization as a component in the neural network architecture, so that it can directly incorporate a solution constraint, or prior knowledge, to predict the RNA base-pairing matrix,” said Chen.
E2Efold is not only more accurate, it is also considerably faster than current techniques.
Current methods are dynamic programming based, which is a much slower approach for predicting longer RNA sequences, such as the genomic RNA in a virus. E2Efold overcomes this drawback by using a gradient-based unrolled algorithm. It also takes advantage of graphic processing units to accelerate its computing process and is now the fastest method available.
RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is an essential building block that governs gene expression and is particularly important for RNA viruses, which consist only of RNA and the enwrapping virion proteins. These types of viruses make up a wide array of infectious diseases, including SARS, Dengue fever, the common cold, and others.
“Unlike most organisms, the genetic information of an RNA virus is RNA. As a result, almost every stage in the RNA virus life cycle relies on RNA heavily,” said Yu Li, a computational bioscience researcher from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) and co-investigator.
“Take SARS, as an example. It belongs to an RNA virus. If we can predict its secondary and 3D structure accurately, based on its sequence information, we can potentially design drugs to bind to its local binding pocket and block the RNA from functioning. In other words, researchers might be able to develop treatments for the virus based on the specific local structure of the target RNA using this method as a starting point,” said Li.
One additional noteworthy ability of E2Efold is its ability to solve for pseudoknots. Pseudoknots are a biologically important RNA secondary structure that are present in roughly 40 percent of RNAs and assist with folding into 3D structures.
“Most previous models were restricted to only predict one type of RNA structure called nested structures. This excluded pseudoknots all together because they were computationally expensive,” said Chen. “In this paper, we predict RNA structures with pseudoknots by adopting a feed-forward model with a 25 percent greater accuracy than previous versions.”
Led by Georgia Tech School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Associate Professor Le Song and KAUST Associate Professor Xin Gao, the team of researchers who created the model will present the paper outlining their findings at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2020.
Although the focus of the paper is on RNA secondary prediction, E2Efold’s end-to-end deep learning approach is generic enough to also be applied to other problems such as protein folding and natural language understanding.
Passing the Torch: Georgia Tech Roboticists Lead Future Generation of Women in the Field
There’s a piece of advice Georgia Tech Ph.D. student De’Aira Bryant recalls most often when it comes to her adviser, School of Interactive Computing Chair Ayanna Howard.
“You’ve got to start somewhere,” said Bryant, a robotics student in the school. “I feel like whenever I’m going through my research, the way I approach it is I have these grand ideas, and I have to break it down to this and this and that. I’m the type who’s normally working on four or five things at the same time. Dr. Howard always tells me: ‘Okay, slow down. We have to start somewhere. We have to start somewhere so we have something to move toward.’”
It’s an appropriate metaphor for Bryant, who began her career in computer science with no previous experience as an undergraduate student at the University of South Carolina. It also applies to all the other women in the field who, like Bryant, rely heavily on those who come before them and pass the torch to those who come after.
Unlike many robotic students, who have stories about being introduced through Lego Mindstorms that allow them to build and program their own Lego robots, the concepts of computer science and robotics were the furthest things from Bryant’s mind. They were completely foreign ideas that she had never given a second thought during her time in middle school and high school.
“That wasn’t me,” Byrant said.
Instead, she happened to take an Intro to Java class in her first year. There, she met her first collegiate mentor, Karina Liles. Liles was a graduate student who worked in a robotics lab and, after first semester, invited Bryant to come work with her as an undergraduate assistant. Bryant saw it as a part-time job and a place she could have her own desk. She wasn’t thinking about it as much more than that.
“I had no idea what her research was,” Bryant said. “I knew it was a robotics lab, so that was cool. And she was in education for low-resource communities. I came from a school that didn’t offer computer science at all, so I found that appealing.”
Once Bryant was introduced to the research process, asking and answering new questions, she was hooked. Collecting data, programming and testing robots then seeing children interact with them face-to-face.
“It made all the difference,” she said.
It was a start, but it was still a new world. Neither of her parents had earned four-year degrees, and her dad had passed away when she was in middle school. When she told her mom and grandmother that she was interested in computer science, she received some hesitancy back. But, while neither had experience in technology, they had raised her to be inquisitive and to seek out mentorship. That’s exactly what Bryant did.
Thrown into the deep end, she relied on Karina and a handful of other women she came across at South Carolina or conferences like Human Robot Interaction and Grace Hopper.
“I was drawn to women in the field, because the nurturing and the support from people who are also in an underrepresented group – whether it’s gender or race or whatever – they can talk to you about those specific challenges that you might come across,” Bryant said.
Eventually, that led her to Howard.
After her junior year in Columbia, Bryant applied to a program called Distributed Research Experiences for Undergrads (DREU). For minority undergraduate students, DREU matches students with mentors who have signed up to take on undergrads into their labs over the summer. Although students can be matched with anyone in the United States, Bryant’s mentor happened to be Howard.
“I was so excited,” said Bryant, who knew of Howard’s research through her own work at South Carolina. The work she was doing with social robots for kids with autism aligned with Howard’s, and it wasn’t uncommon for the Georgia Tech professor’s name to be cited in one of their papers. “There was a student matched with a mentor in Hawaii, and everyone thought that was the luckiest one. I was like, ‘No, I’m pretty sure I got the best deal.’”
Bryant worked on a project in Howard’s lab that summer with three other undergrads. Howard was immediately impressed with Bryant because of her unique programming ability.
“I remember needing someone to program the robot, and she was just like, ‘Oh, I can do it,’” Howard said. “She impressed me right away, and when it was time for her to choose a graduate program I knew she’d fit perfectly in our lab.”
Their work together now is impacting individuals with disabilities, making technology work for everybody including those with motor or visual or hearing impairments. They are investigating robot gendering and its impact on human trust, and work toward inclusivity with programs like AI4All.
Bryant is using the inspiration that Howard has provided to her and feels a responsibility to continue that for the next generation of women roboticists. She is humbled by people who now look up to her like she did to Howard, being left speechless by a young student who featured her for a school project on Black History Month.
When she goes to Grace Hopper, Bryant loves meeting the undergrads and passing on her advice about academics and the challenges women face in the field. She also watches to make sure they are asking questions or calls on those who look like they have a question, but are afraid to ask.
“I remember being that person in the room,” she said. “Women don’t just need representation, they need a voice. I want to be their champion, connect them to the right people.”
And her biggest advice to them might sound familiar.
“Just start,” she said. “You’ve got to start somewhere.”
New Professor Uses Networks to Connect the Dots for Social Good
How do governments decide to systematically address an outbreak? How can networks help us prioritize relief efforts after a natural disaster?
These are some of the questions that B. Aditya Prakash, a newly tenured associate professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), aims to answer.
Prakash’s research invents new data science and machine learning techniques for networks and sequences. His work has applications in public health, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure systems, and the web. By using these techniques, Prakash is able to solve real-world problems and develop tools to help leading organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Wal-Mart, Facebook, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
“A big draw for me to these technically challenging problems is their inherent interdisciplinary and potential for high societal impact. Simply put, progress here can save lives and make a real difference", he said.
Seeing the Big Picture
For Prakash, making a difference does not end with just understanding the data and using it for different applications. Instead, Prakash believes in using data science as a means to drive informed policies and decisions.
“Networks are a great abstraction for modeling real-world phenomena. As they give us both a local and a global perspective, they are able to provide an opportunity to bridge gaps between data, models, and actionable strategies,” he said.
His work is now used for a wide variety of these phenomena including finding failure hot spots in energy grids, guiding users to relevant products on e-commerce websites, and designing policies to determine how best to allocate scarce resources for hospital infection control. His group is also taking part in the CDC forecasting project for past and current pandemics, which aims to use influenza-like illness surveillance data to understand the trajectory of disease outbreak in the US.
“From a data science viewpoint, even though it may not be immediately obvious sometimes, all of these problems have one thing in common: a change in one part can cause a change in other parts, even those that are not directly connected, due to network effects. If you only studied these events in isolation, you would never be able to understand the bigger picture,” he said.
Controlling Epidemics
Prakash has worked extensively with projects that use these network effects to our advantage, such as studying how to detect, forecast, and control infectious epidemics. His group has developed many network algorithms for optimizing the distribution of vaccines and plan interventions, such as quarantining, to stop and flatten epidemic incidence curves.
Prakash said, “As diseases leverage the contact networks to spread, some links are more central and important than others. Some nodes are more important for spreading the disease than others. Hence, the idea is to figure out the best way to efficiently cut links which can help us the most in controlling an epidemic – given resource, behavioral, and economic constraints.”
As data collection is exploding across multiple spheres, Prakash’s research focus aims to provide a data-oriented viewpoint for large-scale problems. His group is building machine learning architectures and data-centric algorithms to use fine-grained surveillance data to guide these decisions, in addition to using epidemiological and mobility models.
Preparing for the What if Scenario
“Currently, we are also trying to study critical infrastructure systems – such as transportation and energy networks – to determine how robust they are, whether or not failures can propagate, and what happens to them during a catastrophic incident,” he said.
Together with ORNL, Prakash’s research group has developed an emergency management system called Urban-Net. It operates by building a series of complex interconnected heterogeneous networks that connect different critical infrastructure components, giving researchers a bird’s-eye view of the entire subsystem. It then uses fast algorithms to help users understand how critical infrastructures may be impacted during various ‘what-if’ disaster scenarios and manage recovery resources.
Prakash said, “One of the challenges is that a lot of these systems are widely distributed. So, while studying the interaction between these components, you find that failures can propagate very far, very quickly – such as the famous Northeast Blackout of 2003.”
Prior to joining Georgia Tech, Prakash was an associate professor of computer science at Virginia Tech. He received his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University and an undergraduate degree at IIT-Bombay. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award, multiple best paper awards, and was named as one of ‘AI 10 to Watch’ by the IEEE.
Pitch Perfect: GT Computing Undergrads Provide Automated Training Upgrade for Softball Team
There’s a classic story that former Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone used to share about Hall-of-Famer Greg Maddux, one of the smartest hurlers of all time. Although the exact details have changed in retelling over time, it goes something like this:
Maddux, a meticulous documenter of pitch sequences and batter results throughout his career, once explained to Mazzone in between innings that the leadoff batter in the following frame would pop out to third base on the fourth pitch of the at-bat. He’d start him with a fastball, change speeds for strike two, waste a pitch outside, and then induce the popup on a one-ball, two-strike count. Sure enough, a few minutes later, Maddux did exactly as he’d said.
There are a couple of lessons here: One, Maddux was a wizard. Many pitchers over time have tried to replicate his impeccable approach to the game, but few have ever succeeded at that level; two, pitch sequence matters – perhaps more than how overpowering your fastball is or how sharp the break is on your curve.
Capitalizing on this intuition, a group of undergraduate students at Georgia Tech are working with the softball team to provide an automated upgrade to players’ training. Using the wealth of statistics kept by the team – pitch-by-pitch data for balls, strikes, types of pitches thrown, and results – they have trained an algorithm that can select the best pitch to throw in any given situation.
The tool is used by the coaches and pitchers for game planning purposes, generating daily reports after every game and practice to help inform coaches of trends in sequences and results.
“In baseball and softball nowadays, data analytics has become such an incredibly important part of the game,” said Jack Bennett, a third-year Industrial Engineering student. “Anything that can get them data to go into games more prepared. Technology is at the forefront of this.”
They began using the approach during the 2019 season. Bennett and partners Zach Panzarino (third-year Computer Science) and Ron Kushkuley (third-year Computer Engineering) had demonstrated a similar capability at last year’s Sports Innovation Hackathon using data for Atlanta Braves pitcher Mike Foltynewicz, finishing in third place. Doug Allvine, assistant athletics director for innovation at Georgia Tech, put the team in touch with softball coach Aileen Morales. Morales was interested, and the students were able to begin testing the approach.
It works like this: The softball team keeps track of its own data – not just player statistics, but pitch selections and results for every pitcher in every game throughout the season. That’s a lot of data and can offer a lot of information. What happened when Pitcher X threw a 3-2 changeup to a lefthanded batter?
But it goes a little deeper than that. Panzarino, Bennett, and Kushkuley found that the pitch sequence is what matters most. That follows the standard strategic thinking – a slider away can be more effective if set up by an inside fastball on the previous pitch, for example. What the algorithm does, however, is consider the order each pitch is thrown in the at-bat and provide a score for which pitch will be most effective based on past data.
“We leverage sequences, the count, outs, everything,” Panzarino said. “Looking at the current state and the previous pitches, it will score all the potential future routes a pitcher can choose. We give them reports before each game so that they can prepare, and then we look at success or failure after the game.”
After a test run a year ago, the students have honed the technology and are working with the team again this year. Qualitatively speaking, they said they noticed results throughout the year.
“When we first gave them our analysis, it would recommend certain stuff in certain situations,” Bennett said. “Maybe it would say a changeup should be thrown more in this situation. Then, when we’d get postgame data later, we’d see that more changeups were being thrown and were continuing to be effective.”
“When I first saw what they were developing, I was beyond impressed,” Morales said. “We are very meticulous with collecting data in our program and trying to find ways to learn more about what is and what is not working for our athletes. It’s remarkable to see how they can take the data we had and leverage it in a way that allowed us to finetune our training.”
Recently, at the 2020 Sports Innovation Hackathon, the group developed a similar solution for baseball. They received runner-up in the competition, and hope to connect further with the Georgia Tech baseball team in the future.
“Tons of theory has been written on how pitchers should approach sequencing in games, but this is a model that can show you the data about how well that works,” Panzarino said.

Georgia Tech and Intel Selected for Multimillion-Dollar DARPA Award
Researchers from Georgia Tech and Intel are working together to strengthen cybersecurity defenses for machine learning (ML) models designed for vision systems.
Bolstered by a new four-year, multimillion-dollar Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant, the team will create deception-resistant ML technologies with an emphasis on object detectors for the Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) program.
Object detectors are a type of technology used to identify objects within an image or video using labels and bounding boxes. While no known real-world attacks have been made on these systems, a team of researchers first identified security vulnerabilities in object detectors in 2018 with a project known as ShapeShifter.
Led by School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Associate Professor Polo Chau at Georgia Tech’s Intel Science and Technology Center for Adversary-Resilient Security Analytics (ISTC-ARSA), the ShapeShifter project exposed adversarial machine learning techniques that were able to mislead object detectors and even erase stop signs from autonomous vehicle detection.
“As ML technologies have developed, researchers used to think that attacking object detectors would be difficult. ShapeShifter showed us that was not true, they can be affected, and we can attack them in a way to have objects disappear completely or be labeled as anything we want,” said Chau, who serves as the lead investigator from Georgia Tech on the GARD program.
“The reason we study vulnerabilities in ML systems is to get into the mindset of the bad guy in order to develop the best defenses. The GARD program provides us with an excellent opportunity for this,” he said.
GARD is a DARPA-funded program that aims to establish theoretical ML foundations to identify system vulnerabilities in real-world applications. Intel and Georgia Tech are leading a program team together under this platform with Intel serving as the prime awardee and Georgia Tech’s funding totaling $1.3 million.
The four-year program is divided into three phases with the first phase focused on enhancing object detection technologies through spatial, temporal, and semantic coherence for both still images and videos. These three defining qualities of object detectors look for contextual clues to determine if a possible anomaly or attack is occurring.
“Our research develops novel coherence-based techniques to protect AI from attacks. We want to inject common sense into the AI that humans take for granted when they look at something. Even the most sophisticated AI today doesn’t ask, ‘Does it make sense that there are all these people floating in the air and are overlapping in odd ways?’ Whereas we would think it’s unnatural,” said Chau. “That is what spatial coherence attempts to address – does it make sense in a relative position?”
This idea of applying common sense to AI object recognition extends to other coherence-based techniques, such as temporal coherence, which checks for suspicious objects’ disappearance or reappearance over time. The team’s UnMask semantic coherence technique, which is based on meaning, looks to identify the parts of an object rather than just the whole, and verifies that those parts indeed make sense.
In terms of defenses, the goal of all three coherence-based techniques is to force attackers to adhere to all categories’ laws created for continuity in the AI. This multi-perspective approach thwarts any future attempts by adversarial ML that do not meet the complex rules, causing any security breach to be flagged.
As AI models with image recognition software are increasingly implemented and used in daily applications, the need to understand and thwart attacks in such programs is critical across fields. The GARD program aims to develop effective defenses across broad ranges of attacks, with Georgia Tech and Intel helping lead the way.

Alumni Launch Company to Help Breweries Go Consumer Direct
When Maryland became one of the first states to ban on-premise dining and drinking for restaurants and bars in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the proprietors of True Respite Brewing Company, like most small business owners, were deeply concerned about the revenue hit their business would suffer.
However, company co-owners Bailey and Brendan O’Leary had a plan. Within minutes of the governor’s order on March 16, they went live with Biermi, a new consumer-direct digital sales platform designed for independent breweries in the U.S. and Canada.
The free platform provides these businesses with a central place to manage the consumer-direct sales process, as well as delivery and pickup logistics. For consumers, the Biermi site lets them enter their zip code to find participating breweries in their area.
Since launching, more than 200 breweries across the country have registered with Biermi, which has processed more than $337,000 in sales in less than a month.
In the days leading up to the statewide order, the O’Learys, both Georgia Tech alumni (BS 2011), could see the pandemic building. They knew they would have to do something to keep their relatively new business afloat.
So, they put their heads together with Brian O’Connor (BS 2008). A Georgia Tech computer science alumnus, O’Connor has a small interest in True Respite and supports the company’s software-related needs.
“True Respite has only been in business for about two years. We knew it was going to take a big economic hit and we wanted to create something that would not only help our company, but that other independent breweries could use to support their businesses while their taprooms are closed,” said O’Connor.
[RELATED: John P. Imlay Jr. Series on Entrepreneurship at GT Computing]
During their discussions, the True Respite team knew that consumer-direct was the way to go. But, like many states, Maryland regulations didn’t allow for the delivery or off-premises sale of alcohol.
“Online was an obvious choice because of the need for social distancing and the growing demand for online services, but delivery seemed like a far-fetched idea as permitting and regulations were unlikely to allow it,” said O’Connor.
Nevertheless, the team decided to move forward. Based on the plan they had sketched out, and on what various sources were telling them about what was likely to happen, O’Connor spent the March 13 weekend building the Biermi platform.
With its front-end application built using the Angular framework and the backend using a mix of cloud-native, serverless technologies and MySQL, Biermi gives breweries more control over how their products are presented. It also allows Biermi to automatically scale to handle the traffic at different times of the day and in various regions across the US and Canada.
Once the platform was ready, the team planned to hold off on the launch until Maryland’s statewide mandate was announced. It turns out they didn’t have to wait long. Governor Larry Hogan made the announcement on Monday, March 16.
Fortunately for the Biermi team, Maryland’s on-premise dining and drinking ban included provisions for loosening alcohol sales and licensing. These relaxed rules paved the way for delivery and curbside pickup for restaurants and breweries.
“Looking back, I’m pretty impressed that we had the foresight to move in this direction,” said O’Connor, who lives in Philadelphia with his wife and twin seven-month-old boys.
With businesses looking for new ways to distribute to their customers, the response so far has been huge. Breweries from Oregon, California, Wisconsin, Georgia, Vermont, Texas, and other states have registered and are doing business through Biermi. According to O’Connor, at least 2 and as many as 10 breweries are registering each day.
Not only are new breweries registering, they are also providing feedback on the platform. O’Connor says he’s making two or three updates every day based on customer feedback.
“One of the things breweries had asked for was a tipping feature, which we have since added to the platform,” O’Connor said.
With such initial success, the Biermi team has an eye toward the future. According to O’Connor, they have been talking about how regulations might change back or be updated once this crisis has passed, and how this could impact potential revenue models.
“There are a couple of routes we could go with this to generate revenue. For now, though, our focus is saving breweries,” O’Connor said.

Lab Manager Lends Expertise to Help 3D Print Prototype Mask
When aerospace engineering doctoral student Lee Whitcher wanted to see if he could 3D print a mold for a new protective mask that he had recently designed for frontline healthcare workers, he turned to the GVU Center’s Prototyping Lab.
Managed by Research Technologist Timothy Trent, the Prototyping Lab is home to the Projet 3510 HD, a state of the art 3D printer. The super high-resolution machine is “leaps and bounds beyond desktop 3D printers,” according to Trent, and capable of printing USP-VI medial grade plastic parts.
Trent, who is a Georgia Tech alumnus (BS CS 17) says the prototype took about 20 hours to produce. After preparing the file and the printer, it took 17 hours to print both halves of the mask prototype. He then spent nearly 3 hours in post-processing to ensure the pieces cured properly and to remove any excess material.
”Making molds should dramatically reduce production time compared to repetitively 3D printing each part," said Trent, a member of the College of Computing Technology Services Organization.
The full story about the project is available on Aerospace Engineering’s website.
Machine Learning Technique Helps Wearable Devices Get Better at Diagnosing Sleep Disorders and Quality
Getting diagnosed with a sleep disorder or assessing quality of sleep is an often expensive and tricky proposition, involving sleep clinics where patients are hooked up to sensors and wires for monitoring.
Wearable devices, such as the Fitbit and Apple Watch, offer less intrusive and more cost-effective sleeping monitoring, but the tradeoff can be inaccurate or imprecise sleep data.
Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are working to combine the accuracy of sleep clinics with the convenience of wearable computing by developing machine learning models, or smart algorithms, that provide better sleep measurement data as well as considerably faster, more energy-efficient software.
The team is focusing on electrical ambient noise that is emitted by devices but that is often not audible and can interfere with sleep sensors on a wearable gadget. Leave the TV on at night, and the electrical signal - not the infomercial in the background - might mess with your sleep tracker.
[Related News: New Deep Learning Approach Improves Access to Sleep Diagnostic Testing]
These additional electrical signals are problematic for wearable devices that typically have only one sensor to measure a single biometric data point, normally heart rate. A device picking up signals from ambient electrical noise skews the data and leads to potentially misleading results.
“We are building a new process to help train [machine learning] models to be used for the home environment and help address this and other issues around sleep,” said Scott Freitas, a second-year machine learning Ph.D. student and co-lead author of a newly published paper.
The team employed adversarial training in tandem with spectral regularization, a technique that makes neural networks more robust to electrical signals in the input data. This means that the system can accurately assess sleep stages even when an EEG signal is corrupted by additional signals like a TV or washing machine.
Using machine-learning methods such as sparsity regularization, the new model can also compress the amount of time it takes to gather and analyze data, as well as increase energy efficiency of the wearable device.
The researchers are testing with a product worn on the head but hope to also integrate it into smartwatches and bracelets. Results would then be transmitted to a person’s doctor to analyze and provide a diagnosis. This could result in fewer visits to the doctor, reducing the cost, time, and stress involved with receiving a sleep disorder diagnosis.
Another issue that the researchers are looking at is reducing the amount of sensors needed to accurately track sleep.
“When someone visits a sleep clinic, they are hooked up to all kinds of monitors and wires to gather data ranging from brain activity on EEG’s, heart rate, and more. Wearable tech only monitors heart rate with one sensor. The one sensor is more ideal and comfortable, so we are looking for a way to get more data without adding more wires or sensors,” said Rahul Duggal, a second-year computer science Ph.D. student and co-lead author.
The team’s work is published in the paper REST: Robust and Efficient Neural Networks for Sleep Monitoring in the Wild, accepted to the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), scheduled to take place April 20 through 24 in Taipei, Taiwan.
Chao Zhang Wins Google Faculty Research Award
School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Assistant Professor Chao Zhang was selected as the winner of the 2019-2020 Google Faculty Research Awards for the category of structured data.
Structured data refers to information organized in a pre-defined manner. It is used to train machine learning models across applications. However, more often than not, real-world data does not fall into this neat category and has file types that are not machine-readable, such as text, images, and videos. This latter form of information is known as unstructured data, and it makes up more than 80 percent of enterprise data and is growing every year.
Given unstructured data’s prevalence, extracting knowledge from this information type is necessary, albeit far more complicated for machine learning programs to use, and often results in identification gaps for the model. For Zhang, this is a critical research emphasis that he has received multiple recognitions for.
“Turning unstructured data into structured knowledge is of great importance to science, engineering, and business. For example, knowledge graphs can be used to accelerate scientific research and empower smartphone virtual assistants,” he said.
“Deep learning models are currently dominating for almost all knowledge extraction problems. However, they do not have the ability to say, ‘I don't know,’ when facing novel situations and can be unreliable in open-world settings.”
Zhang’s research addresses this challenge by developing new techniques that quantify uncertainty for deep learning models and essentially let them know when they are unable to recognize something and how to proceed. This research can be an important step to improve the robustness and effectiveness of existing knowledge extraction technology.
“It is great to be recognized by the Google Faculty Research Award. The support of this award will allow my group to continue making our contributions to solving some pressing problems in this area,” said Zhang.
Zhang has been previously recognized and awarded for his work in this field with the 2019 SIGKDD Doctoral Dissertation Runner-up Award and the 2015 ECML/PKDD Best Student Paper Runner-up Award.
IC Ph.D. Students Named 2020 Members of NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program
A pair of School of Interactive Computing students was selected as 2020 members of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP).
First-year Ph.D. students Daniel Bolya (advised by Judy Hoffman) and Joanne Truong (advised by Dhruv Batra and Sonia Chernova) were recognized by the program, which supports graduate students pursuing research-based Master’s and doctoral degrees at United States institutions.
The NSF GRFP provides financial support for three years, comprised of a $34,000 stipend per 12-month fellowship year, as well as a direct payment of $12,000 to Georgia Tech toward the cost of education for each of the three years of fellowship funding.
Bolya’s work is in machine learning and computer vision. Recent work at Georgia Tech has focused on error profiling in instance segmentation and object detection models. His method, building upon previous work at MIT, is unique in that it captures all possible sources of error in a model, while properly weighing the importance of each. He plans to continue pursuit of faster methods of instance segmentation that can he make accessible. Current methods are not practical for many applications due to limits in speed, accuracy, and data efficiency. His research addresses this challenge.
“This is not just about computer vision,” he said in his research statement. “Improving instance segmentation would impact the tech we use every day.”
Like his work at MIT, called YOLACT, he plans to fully release the project open source once it is ready.
Truong’s long-term research goal is to develop robots that can see, talk, reason, and act in complex human environments. Specifically, she will focus on a method called “sim2robot transfer,” which develops efficient domain adaptation techniques to enable pre-training of AI agents in simulators while ensuring that the learned skills generalize to a real robotic platform.
“The overall goals of my research plan are to, one, break down the possible errors in simulation-to-reality transfer that result in a reality gap, and, two, close the loop between simulation and reality by using data collected on a real robot to finetune and optimize parameters in simulation,” she said.
She worked on the first goal last fall, achieving optimization in simulator settings for sim2real predictivity. Currently, she is working on the second goal, developing domain adaptation techniques to enable low-shop adaptation between simulation and reality.
Two CSE Faculty Welcomed to the 2020 Class of SIAM Fellow
Interim Chair and Professor Srinivas Aluru and CSE Professor and Associate Chair Ümit V. Çatalyürek have both been inducted into the 2020 Class of Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Fellows.
Nominated for exemplary research and outstanding service to the SIAM community, Aluru and Çatalyürek’s nominations account for two of the 28 inducted into this year’s international fellows program.
Ümit V. Çatalyürek
Çatalyürek is being recognized by SIAM for his contributions to the fields of combinatorial scientific computing, and high-performance and parallel algorithms – fields of research in which he has won a number of awards in prior.
This award listing includes a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award and a Class of 2016 IEEE Fellow for his research contributions to the fields of discrete algorithms and high-performance computing.
“Discrete algorithms, and in particular, graph and hypergraph algorithms, are my passion. When solving some of the problems, I feel like a child trying to solve a puzzle,” he said.
“To solve larger problems, we need parallel algorithms because the problems either do not fit on a single computer or we need to make the solutions more efficient and useful in real-life settings.”
This idea of solving for these larger problems is where combinatorial scientific computing comes into play. This interdisciplinary research area uses graphs and parallel algorithms to solve computational science and engineering problems on large-scale HPC architectures. Combinatorial problems arise in many different fields of science, such as when constructing the genome of a new species that is being sequenced for the first time.
“At the core of almost all large-scale scientific computing is the question of how to partition and assign work and computation to processors of a large complex parallel system, and how to orchestrate the execution to minimize execution time, or energy consumption. These are some of the fundamental questions I try to answer in my research,” said Çatalyürek.
One recent project of Çatalyürek’s that addresses these questions this is a three-year, cross-institute NSF project that aims to lower the barrier to entry for software engineers developing new high-performance applications on large scale parallel systems.
Srinivas Aluru
Aluru is being recognized by SIAM for his contributions to the field of computational genomics with sequential and parallel discrete algorithms research and for his leadership in data science and engineering.
He is the recipient of numerous awards for his research, including being selected as an IEEE Fellow in recognition for high-performance computing (HPC) research and being selected as an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow in recognition of research at the intersection of computing and biology.
“These are all various aspects of the same interdisciplinary research my group has been focusing on for 23 years now,” he said.
According to Aluru, “Awards such as SIAM Fellow are given for sustained contributions over a very long period of time; sometimes, you have to wait to see the impact of a work. One major example of this impact within my group is the work we did to develop parallel algorithms and software for assembling genomes from tens to hundreds of millions of genomic fragments.”
The specific research project Aluru references enabled the successful sequencing of the maize genome, the first plant genome ever to be sequenced. The sequence was published in a 2009 Science paper that is now, according to Google Scholar, cited 3271 times, and is a go-to resource for biological research on this important food crop.
“Maize is much more complex than a human genome, with about 75 percent of the genome consisting of repeats of various sizes, tripping up efforts in accurately assembling the genome,” he said.
Before the success of Aluru’s team, it was believed that sequencing genomes on highly distributed memory-challenged platforms, such as the IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer, was not feasible. However, this was not Aluru’s only time overcoming the impossible in this field of research. He led the first group to develop efficient parallel discrete algorithms which allowed for biological networks to be constructed at the whole genome scale within minutes using the world's fastest supercomputers.
“It is really a tribute to the hard work of many of my graduate students who contributed greatly to my work over the years. Hopefully, the elevated recognition for our group's work will also enhance their opportunities,” said Aluru.
In addition to his leadership and research within CSE, Aluru maintains a number of roles to enhance data science initiatives at the state and national levels. Currently, he serves as the Executive Director of the Institute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS), co-leads the NSF South Big Data Regional Innovation Hub which nurtures big data partnerships between organizations in the 16 Southern States and Washington D.C., as well as the NSF Transdisciplinary Research Institute for Advancing Data Science.
Topliff, Truong Tapped for 2020 NDSEG Fellowships
Charles Topliff and Joanne Truong have been named as recipients of the 2020 National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowships. They are both Ph.D. students in the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).
The NDSEG Fellowships are funded by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), through the Office of the Under Secretary for Research and Engineering and the military services, to promote education in science and engineering disciplines relevant to the DoD mission.
Topliff is a second year ECE Ph.D. student in the machine learning program. He is co-advised by ECE Associate Professors Morris Cohen and Mark Davenport. Topliff’s research is focused on time series forecasting using modern machine learning techniques. He is also interested in explainability in machine learning.
For many applications in time series forecasting, it isn’t enough to just improve predictive capabilities. As an example, Topliff wants to know when solar flares can be expected to influence the power grid and what can done to prepare. However, it would be difficult to convince anyone to make decisions without explainability. Having a strong understanding of why Topliff’s models produce forecasts that necessitate action will provide guidance for authorities in their decision making.
Truong is a first year ECE Ph.D. student in the robotics program. She is co-advised by Sonia Chernova and Dhruv Batra, who are associate professors in the School of Interactive Computing and the Machine Learning Center. Truong’s long-term research goal is to allow robots to intelligently interact with humans in complex environments to improve quality of life. She hopes to develop techniques to enable the transfer of robot skills learned in simulation to a real robotic system. This is important because working in simulation presents many benefits: it’s often cheaper, faster, and safer than working on a real robot. However, it’s non-trivial to transfer this learned knowledge onto a real robot, as many inconsistencies and differences exist between the simulation platform and the real world.
Truong hopes to develop generalization techniques to bridge the gap between simulation and reality so that robotics developments can be done by more artificial intelligence researchers/students – even those who don’t have access to the physical hardware, which will help to accelerate robotics research.
Machine Learning Method Amplifies ‘Voice of the People’ to Model Workplace Culture
Human resources professionals and job seekers alike may soon be able to better understand a company’s unique organizational culture thanks to a new machine-learning approach.
Developed by Georgia Tech researchers, the approach is the first of its kind to computationally model organizational culture using publicly available anonymized data sources – including Glassdoor user reviews.
These models are illustrated using heat maps that reveal positive and negative sentiment for a company and its business units across 41 dimensions of organizational culture.
The heat maps give a “cloud-contributed” sense of what the culture is like in a particular workplace and can provide actionable insights to HR teams, unit managers, and job seekers, according to the researchers.
“Right now, to get a measure of organizational culture, companies rely on internal surveys, which are difficult to scale. It’s also unlikely that they are getting true responses given factors like organizational bias or employee concerns about anonymity,” said Vedant Das Swain, a second-year Ph.D. student studying human-computer interaction at Georgia Tech.
With a potential dataset of more than 35 million Glassdoor user reviews about 770,000+ companies, “straight off the bat, for a company’s HR unit, our approach will allow them to go beyond traditional surveys. They gain scalability in terms of the number of people they can represent in a model of their workplace culture,” Das Swain said.

“Existing measures are mostly done by companies themselves, which means they might not be transparent if it’s not in their interest to do so. This approach utilizes the voice of the people,” said Koustuv Saha, a fourth-year Ph.D. student studying social computing and computational social science.
The computational approach to modeling organizational culture has other advantages. Unlike traditional surveys, the method lets HR managers run reports virtually as often as needed, even retrospectively. This provides them with the ability to assess and understand how their company’s organizational culture changes over time. And, because the tool assesses workplace culture across business functions, team managers throughout the business can see where things are working well, and where they are not.
Along with helping business unit managers better understand what’s happening within their teams, this level of detail can also be a huge benefit for job seekers.
“A prospective employee can look at all of the cultural dimensions in the heat map and see that the people in a particular unit or division of a company speak favorably about competitiveness and then say, ‘you know what, I like a competitive atmosphere, maybe I’ll self-select myself into this opportunity,” said Das Swain.
To create the 41 dimensions of organizational culture that serve as the framework for their research, Das Swain and Saha started with publicly available job descriptors from Occupational Information Network (O*NET), an occupational information database sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor. The job descriptor language is rooted in occupational psychology. It also reflects current workplace norms and expectations for nearly 200 professional and technical occupations.
With this database, the team developed 41 computer-readable language models. Models like these are known as word vectors and can reveal often-unseen connections between seemingly unrelated words, compound words, phrases, as well as word parts like prefixes and suffixes.
For the team, these word vectors are the backbone of their approach and serve as a multi-faceted representation of organizational culture.
“The 41 dimensions reflect what is important in a job role and in workplace behavior. We’re able to operationalize them, or put them to use, by converting them into machine-understandable language through the word vectors,” Saha said.
To proof their framework of organizational culture, the team analyzed more than 615,000 Glassdoor user reviews from 92 companies from the Fortune 500 List. In all, the dataset contained more than 10.7 million words from user reviews classified as ‘pro’ and more than 17.1 million words from user reviews classified as ‘con’.
“Once you start making things machine-interpretable, it can become so nuanced that it’s mumbo jumbo for humans and impossible to interpret. We wanted to see if there was a way to operationalize this information to measure a company’s culture by simply looking at what people say in self-initiated pro or con reviews from Glassdoor,” said Das Swain, who is advised by Georgia Tech Regents' Professor Gregory Abowd and Assistant Professor Munmun De Choudhury.
“With our framework, we can make sense of that volume of data to accurately model a company’s workplace culture so that people can experience the norms, the beliefs of an organization without ever being there.”
“People make the place. We’re leveraging what lots of people are saying about a place to get a cloud-contributed sense of what the workplace culture is within that particular company,” said Saha, a fifth-year Ph.D. student who is advised by De Choudhury.
Das Swain and Saha are co-authors of Modeling Organizational Culture with Workplace Experiences Shared on Glassdoor, which appears in the CHI 2020 Proceedings. The work is supported in part by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), via IARPA Contract No. 2017-17042800007.
SCS Ph.D. Student is at the Forefront of Emerging Memory Systems Research
When Thaleia Dimitra Doudali started her Ph.D. in the School of Computer Science (SCS), she couldn’t have picked a better time to do systems research.
The rise of big data created research opportunities for new memory hardware that would offer higher capacity at a lower cost compared to traditional technologies. At the same time, the field of machine learning (ML) was booming.
Doudali saw a chance to have an influence on a new paradigm in computing and has built a research career on using ML-based methods to manage emerging memory systems.
All in the Family
Doudali has always taken advantage of the opportunities around her. Computing runs in the family. Her father is an electrical engineer, and her older brothers took an interest in computing as kids. Their passion meant Doudali got to play around on her first computer at 12 to explore YouTube and other media.
Despite her early exposure to computers, Doudali didn’t think about computer science as a field of study until her final two years of high school. With a plan to be a doctor, she was taking a lot of biology classes but noticed how much her brothers enjoyed their computer science studies at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in Athens, Greece.
When Doudali started NTUA, she joined undergraduate program of electrical and computer engineering. Doudali completed a thesis on databases, creating a dataset generator for social networks enriched with geographic and textual information. This research experience at the Computing Systems Laboratory (CSLab) at NTUA showed Doudali where she wanted to take her career.
“I knew I wanted to stay in a university and wasn’t ready to go into industry yet,” she said. “I really liked the research process and collaboration.”
Research Agenda
A Ph.D. was the next step, and Doudali already knew about Georgia Tech thanks to her older brother, who completed a Ph.D. in computer architecture. She was instantly taken with the warm and welcoming environment of the school on her visit day.
The school embraced her, too. Doudali immediately started working with Associate Professor Ada Gavrilovska, who introduced Doudali to her future research field — heterogeneous memory systems.
Heterogeneous memory systems use new hardware technologies, such as persistent memory, or resource disaggregation techniques to meet the high capacity needs of big data applications at a reasonable cost compared to traditional systems. The varying access speeds of the available memory components make it necessary for intelligent data management methods to boost application performance.
“It was an interesting problem because heterogeneity now exists across the system’s hardware stack, like compute, memory, and storage units,” Doudali said.
A New Opportunity
As Intel’s Optane DC persistent memory rolled out, Doudali knew this was her window to do research that could really impact how a new product is used in real-time. Her research group harnessed ML to improve upon the challenging process of deciding where to place data in heterogeneous memory systems.
“We were interested in how ML could shape better systems,” Doudali said.
The result was Kleio, an ML-based data management methodology for heterogeneous memory systems. Kleio uses ML to predict data access pattern behavior and decide which data to move between the available memory units to improve application performance. The project has only continued to grow as more research questions open, such as how much data to move and at what times given network conditions.
[Machine Learning Makes Memory Management More Efficient]
Doudali’s work has been recognized across the field. Kleio was a best paper award finalist at the 28th International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2019). Recently, her alma mater invited her to give a talk on Kleio. She also served on a committee for the top systems conference EuroSys, which allows researchers to become familiar with the selection process of the technical program in academic conferences.
To boost her academic career, Doudali has acquired industry experience while interning at AMD, VMWare, and DellEMC. Ultimately, she plans to continue her research career after graduation.
Community Involvement
Doudali also gives back to the community she found a home in. She helps organize SCS visit days for prospective Ph.D. students and student meetings with faculty candidates. She is also an executive board member of the Hellenic Society, a cultural organization that connects students of Greek heritage and shares Greek traditions with the campus community.
Doudali’s impact on the community has been appreciated. In April, she was invited to share four life quotes that shaped her Ph.D. journey as part of GT’s Illuminate Tech speaker series.
“Just let go of the things you cannot control right now,” she said during the event, “keep working hard, and trust that whatever happens is for the best.”
Three Faculty Members Promoted in School of Computer Science
The School of Computer Science (SCS) has promoted three faculty members. Hyesoon Kim and Santosh Pande became full professors, and Jacob Abernethy was granted tenure as an associate professor.
“Promotion and the award of tenure are some of the ways we as an academic community recognize the accomplishments of our people,” said Interim Chair Mostafa Ammar. “I am extremely pleased that we are able to recognize Jake, Hyesoon, and Santosh. They have always been valuable members of the SCS family, and I look forward to their continued success.”
Hyesoon Kim
Kim joined SCS in 2007 as a computer architect. She focuses on developing tools to improve performance and efficiency on heterogeneous architectures such as central processing units, graphics processing units, and embedded systems.
“I am very excited about the promotion; it means all lot to me,” Kim said. “When I was promoted to associate, I felt that I should stop running and look around because where else would I go. Now I feel that I would learn how to fly. “
Kim runs the High Performance Architecture Lab at Georgia Tech, where students and faculty develop high-performance and energy-efficient computing from microarchitectures to compilers.
“Thank you to all the people who helped me to build my career at Georgia Tech, including my graduate and undergraduate students, mentors, colleagues,” she said.
Santosh Pande
Pande has been with SCS since 2000. His work in compiler optimization is prolific and has considerable influence. Pande has published more than 100 papers, worked with top industry partners, and released several software systems
"This promotion means a lot to me looking back as well as peeking into the future,” Pande said. “I feel gratified for the recognition of scholarship in terms of research and education and its impact on the body of students I worked with at all levels.”
Pande focuses on practical problems he can provide foundational solutions for, such as evolving architectures for systems and security problems. With this in mind, Pande is currently working on solving software debloating problems and model-based program analysis and optimizations.
“I fell in love with compilers, which offered a unique blend of theory and practice and continue to be fascinated by its elegance (an art form), its deep theoretical moorings (science), and its robust engineering practices,” he said. “As I assume my new rank, I feel even more empowered and excited about making deep contributions to the advancement of my area and towards shaping up ambitious careers of my students at all levels."
Jacob Abernethy
Abernethy started at SCS in 2017 but has quickly made a mark with machine learning solutions to real-world problems such as the Flint Water Crisis. His work has received national news attention and National Science Foundation funding. He is also recognized as the leader in his field, working at Google Research in the Summer of 2019 and serving as program co-chair for the 2020 Conference on Learning Theory (COLT).
Abernethy has long felt part of the College of Computing and honored to receive this acknowledgment.
“In my first year in grad school, I watched [SCS Professor] Santosh Vempala give a phenomenal keynote talk at a conference I was attending,” he said. “I recall thinking at the time that becoming a tenured professor at Georgia Tech would be just an unimaginable accomplishment. It is amazing to think that 13 years later I would manage to get there myself!”
AP Bowl Goes Virtual, May Expand to Reach More Students
Since 2006, the College of Computing has been helping area high school students prepare to take the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science A exam. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, this year is no exception.
More than 100 Atlanta-area students participated in the virtual 2020 AP Bowl on April 19, which uses a mock exam and other materials to help ensure students pass the actual AP CS A exam. Students that pass the test earn college credits.
“We are contacting the teachers of the students that participated in the AP Bowl and providing them with their students’ scores. They will give us the actual AP exam scores when they are available. The students with the highest scores will be rewarded,” said Sherri Ann Clausnitzer, event co-coordinator.
The event is organized and managed each year by the College’s Office of Outreach, Enrollment, and Community (OEC). As many as 325 students have participated in recent years, but Clausnitzer says registration for this year’s event was closed early because of the pandemic.
“The high school students who participated were all very excited and grateful that the AP Bowl was not canceled. The level of engagement with the students was much higher than we hoped it would be,” Clausnitzer said.
To facilitate the virtual event, Clausnitzer and co-coordinator Ryan Mendes, both of whom are OEC team members, used the online meeting platform Bluejeans. They also used Canvas, a course management platform.
"This was the first time we delivered AP Bowl online so we did a lot of preparation on our end, learning the tools on the go. It was a big-time commitment, but ultimately the platforms worked great for our use case and the work paid off with how smoothly everything went on test day,” Mendes said.
Despite a few issues, the organizers say that they found the online AP Bowl to be as gratifying as doing the exam in-person and the virtual format offered a lot of freedom and flexibility.
“We were able to save thousands of dollars by not having to cater the event. We did not have to book any rooms or do any set-ups. We did not have to give any tours or create any PowerPoint presentations or speeches. And we did not have to grade all of the AP Bowl exams since Canvas is equipped with an awesome grading system,” said Clausnitzer.
Going forward, the team says they will continue with the online version of the event and plan to host AP Bowls more than once during the year. They also would like to include prep for the AP CS Principles exam that was introduced a few years ago.
"An on-campus AP Bowl is great but is naturally limited to those who can make the trip to Tech. Taking the AP Bowl online allows us the opportunity to reach more students easily, and now we can consider delivering a practice exam for both CS A and CS P,” said Mendes.
“Also, instead of just aiming for schools in metro Atlanta, we can reach out to schools across Georgia and maybe even across the nation to participate in the AP Bowl.”
OMSCS Student Awarded Major Scholarship by The Honor Society Foundation
Mohammad Fotouhi, a student in the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program, has received the Honor Society Foundation’s Graduate Achiever Scholarship for Winter 2020.
The scholarship is one of seven highly competitive awards the foundation presents to students across the U.S. who demonstrate high academic achievement and determination.
“Winning this scholarship is a great encouragement and it is an honor to be recognized for this competitive award,” Fotouhi said.
Originally from Iran, Fotouhi received his Ph.D. in geotechnical engineering from Iowa State University, where he also discovered a passion for computer science. After his doctoral work required him to program and do data analysis, he wanted to continue his education with OMSCS.
Fotouhi joined OMSCS in January 2018 to study machine learning. Throughout the program, he has maintained a 4.0 GPA. Because of his grades, he was invited to join the National Honor Society and apply for its scholarships. He will use the funding for his final semester.
OMSCS has been life changing for Fotouhi. After he graduates this spring, he will shift careers from geotechnical/structural engineering to data science.
“Attending OMSCS is one of the best decisions I’ve made,” he said. “The quality and scope of the courses offered has allowed me to make progress in my career.”
OMSCS Student Uses Machine Learning to Help Understand Covid-19
With dozens of research papers about Covid-19 being published each week, it can be difficult for doctors and scientists to read the most important studies.
A student at Georgia Tech, however, is using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques like natural language processing and machine learning (ML) to narrow down the most relevant information in this growing data set.
Kenneth Miller, a student in Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS), is using these tools to develop algorithms to ensure that the most important Covid-19 research reaches doctors. His work is part of an ongoing challenge to use ML to empower the medical community to find the best Covid-19 studies.
Information Overload
The challenge started when Kaggle, a Google data science and ML community, partnered with the White House and several leading research groups to create the Covid-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). With more than 47,000 scholarly articles about Covid-19 and other coronaviruses, it’s one of the most comprehensive research databases for the pandemic.
To sift through the data, Kaggle released CORD-19 to its community and asked them to use it to answer some of the toughest research questions about COVID-19. As incentive, for every task completed successfully, participants like Miller receive $1,000 in prize money.
As an OMSCS student specializing in ML, Miller has joined a few previous Kaggle challenges, but for much less significant tasks like home values or NCAA brackets. For Miller, working on this dataset presented an especially relevant problem.
“I am fascinated with everything AI, so when I heard about this, I figured if any of my skills could help anyone, I should try,” said Miller, who is a lawyer outside of his studies.
Keep it Simple
Miller said his OMSCS studies prepared him for the challenge. The AI track focuses on the practical implementation of AI methods. This made it easier for Miller to start with an overwhelming amount of data and get to an endpoint that solves the problem. His experience using the programming language Python for class also enabled him to agilely work with the data.
Armed with this knowledge, Miller applied a strategy he uses on every project.
“Whenever I start a new project, I try and see if I can craft a simple yet effective solution from scratch,” he said.
He has worked on specific Kaggle challenges he can apply this strategy. The first ML model Miller developed finds the most relevant sentences in a study. To accomplish this, he used a simple scoring algorithm that determines how many times keywords appear in a sentence. Then the model measures the ratio of keyword occurrences to sentence length.
For a separate challenge, Miller created a search engine for common Covid-19 research questions, such as: What is the average time the disease takes to incubate? How long is it contagious? How long until symptoms appear?
Up to the Challenge
These are just a few of Miller’s models, and he continues to work on new challenges Kaggle offers. Tasks now include deep dives into epidemiology, understanding how many patients a study was based on, and what scientific method was employed.
“The trick, as in any project like this, is understanding and assimilating the data to start with,” Miller said. “But using Python makes the initial data wrangling pretty easy. The hardest part is building new ways to squeeze more desired info out of the documents.”
Miller’s efforts have been noticed. His work has been cited several times on the contributions page.

Social Media and Wellbeing: Does Bias in Self-Reported Data Impact Research?
Along with the development of each new technological platform comes a series of questions designed to understand its ultimate impact on users’ wellbeing or performance. It’s like clockwork.
Does watching too much television rot your child’s brain? How much is too much when it comes to video games? Is our time spent on social media impacting our mental health?
These are all important questions, but how they are asked matters to the ultimate conclusions we can draw. It is well-established that the most commonly used method in this area of research – user self-reports and survey questions – are prone to error. Now, new research from collaborators at Georgia Tech, Facebook, and the University of Michigan have shed light on the nature of error – that is to say whether user over or underestimate their data, who and which questions are more prone to error, and more.
Error in the data, said School of Interactive Computing Ph.D. student Sindhu Ernala, can impact the inferences drawn from the data itself.
“We know survey questions have several well-documented biases,” Ernala said. “People may not remember correctly. They can’t keep up with their time. They remember recent things more accurately than those further in the past. All of this matters because error in measurement might impact the downstream inferences we make. Accurate assessments of social media use is critical because of the everyday impact it has on people’s lives.”
Indeed, Ernala and her collaborators found that these biases held up in many surveys. In a paper accepted to the 2020 ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing (CHI), they picked 10 of the most common survey questions in prior literature that investigate time spent on Facebook. The questions were asked in a variety of ways: open ended or multiple choice, the frequency of visits or the total time spent. They asked these 10 questions in a survey to 50,000 random users in 15 countries around the world.
With self-reported data in hand, they compared it to the actual server logs at Facebook to see how it stacked up. Interestingly, people most often overestimated the time they spent on the platform and underestimated the number of times they visited. Specifically, in the 18-24 demographic, a common age range for research done at universities, there was even more error in self-reports.
“This is important, because a lot of our research is done with these age samples,” Ernala said.
With this information in mind, the researchers made a handful of recommendation in order to improve the data and, thus, the research around the data itself:
- As a researcher, if you are investigating time spent, consider using time tracking applications as an alternative to self-report time spent measures. These applications include things like Apple’s screen time feature or Facebook’s “Your Time on Facebook.”
- If researchers want to use surveys, which often makes sense, consider using the phrasing with the lowest error or multiple-choice questions.
The researchers caution against using time spent self-reports directly, but rather interpret reports as noisy estimates of where someone falls on a distribution. More important when determining wellbeing outcomes is how users actually spend their time on the platform.
“Social platforms change and user habits change over time,” Ernala said. “The questions now might not be the best questions five or 10 years from now. This is fluid, and we need to continue to look at this to make sure our past and future research is well-informed.”
She and her collaborators hope to contribute positively to this ongoing process by providing some validated measures that can be used across studies, while understanding that these methods may change over time as user habits transform.
NSF Grant to Fund Georgia Tech Research into Psychological Impact of COVID-19
Arguably the most visible of all prescriptions to the COVID-19 pandemic this year have been guidelines or imposed restrictions commonly referred to as “social distancing.” Less physical contact, the thinking goes, means a lowered risk of viral transmission.
Like the virus itself, however, stress and anxiety stemming from overconsumption of news or other media can spread through social networks. As the mental health fallout becomes clearer, are some similar social media distancing recommendations needed to stem the flow through the online world?
A multidisciplinary team of researchers at Georgia Tech, Washington University-St. Louis, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison argue that these mental health implications of the pandemic are equally important, and a new grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) has recently funded new research to that effect.
“It’s not just the fear and anxiety that I might get infected or I might infect or know someone who is infected,” said Munmun De Choudhury, an associate professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing and the co-principal investigator on the project. “It’s all of these things around it that are furthering the psychological impact. It’s very different from other kinds of illnesses or pandemics because of the uncertainty of the crisis. We simply don’t know how long we are into it.”
The grant is funded by the NSF’s Rapid Response Project program, which is intended for research that addresses an immediate need within society. It has provided $200,000 toward the yearlong project.
The research will combine investigations in two separate environments: the online world, where news, personal posts, videos, and other media are shared rampantly across social networks, and the offline real world, where the epidemiological data about the spread of the virus or economic data about the financial fallout can be measured.
For the former, they will use social media data from various popular social platforms – Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube – to measure the spread of information and how consumers of it express themselves in terms of anxiety or fear, or what they are saying about their own psychological wellbeing.
“How often are people expressing anger or fear or blaming someone through their posts?” said Srijan Kumar, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering and the other co-principal investigator. “We’ll develop new classifiers using natural language processing that will help us classify social posts into two categories: either anxiety-inducing or anxiety itself.”
This is new territory, according to De Choudhury. Although there have been other pandemics such as the 1918 influenza epidemic, none of this magnitude have taken place during the digital/social age. And while social media provides an important mechanism for staying informed and remaining in contact with friends and loved ones during the difficult social distancing measures, overexposure could result in negative mental health consequences.
“There is probably a sweet spot,” De Choudhury said. “Just like we need physical distancing in the real world, we probably need to practice distancing from social media or online information to an extent to avoid consuming too much anxiety-inducing media, while also staying informed.
“If I say something, it doesn’t just affect me. It affects all the people who read my posts. If they share it or if they post something, then it affects all of their social neighbors. It can be an outward ripple that affects people. We want to measure that, how they spread through social networks.”
They’ll compare that data with the other element: the offline world. Currently, people in New York City are likely more stressed and anxious in a different way than people in Georgia. New York has been the epicenter of the viral outbreak in the United States, meaning that much of the anxiety locally stems from the virus itself.
Will I contract the virus? Will someone I know contract the virus? Can I go to the store for groceries? How much disinfecting is required when I return home?
And then, you can tease out that geographical data. How are higher-income individuals stressed in comparison to lower-income? What about differences along racial lines? Data has shown higher mortality rates in African-Americans, for example, which leads to different fears than those in other communities.
In U.S. cities where there is also sufficient social media data, they will examine this offline data to see rates of infection, fatalities, when shelter-in-place was imposed, and more.
The final piece will be what they will do with this information. The goal is to create tools for social platforms to provide coping techniques or guidelines for use.
“Maybe that might include encouraging you to limit the amount of time you spend on social media,” Kumar said. “Or, maybe you step out and do something with family members. Some kind of physical activity. Then we can begin to examine how people react to these messages. Do we see that their anxiety levels are coming down, or not?”
“In this time, we have a very unique lens to study this pandemic in a whole new light as opposed to other events of a global scale,” De Choudhury said. “There is no guarantee this won’t come back. And even if it doesn’t, something else will. Being able to have these tools built and available will better prepare us for the future.”
Ellen Zegura Named Second Regents’ Professor in School of Computer Science
College of Computing Professor Ellen Zegura has been named a Regents’ Professor.
The University System of Georgia and Georgia Tech recognizes tenured professors with this honor for their research excellence and contributions to the Institute. Zegura has made a career of networking and computing for social good research and teaching.
“Over my 27 years on the faculty at Georgia Tech, I have frequently been asked if I considered going elsewhere,” said Zegura, who is a Stephen P. Fleming Chair in Telecommunications in the School of Computer Science. “The answer is that I have been able to do so many interesting and different things all while remaining right here. I am proud to have witnessed and contributed to the incredible growth of the university.”
Zegura is a leader across computing. She was named head of the Computing Research Association’s Board of Directors in 2018. She also leads the Center for Computing and Societies and its partnership with Georgia State around public interest technologies, a program that partners Georgia Tech computer scientists with Georgia State University social scientists to address social inequities.
Her research also connects networking and public interest. Last year, Zegura received a $150,000 Mozilla grant to incorporate ethics to the undergraduate computing curriculum. She has also researched how to bring better networks to Native American tribal lands.
Prasad Tetali, a joint professor in the Schools of Computer Science and Math, also had his Regents’ professorship renewed this year. Interim Chair Mostafa Ammar is also a Regents’ Professor, and Professor Seymour Goodman holds one joint with the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs.
"Being named Regents' Professor at Georgia Tech is a recognition of a faculty member's long-term distinguished scholarly and service contributions to their intellectual discipline, the academic profession and the Institute,” said Ammar. “I was very pleased to see Ellen Zegura receive such a well-deserved recognition. Prasad Tetali's renewal of his 2017 Regents' Professor appointment is further recognition of his continued impact and contributions. "
IC Students Support Innovation in India through 'MakerGhat'
Azra Ismail was working with health workers in Delhi, India, when she had a realization. What she saw from locals in the community was that there was an intense desire for societal impact from many workers – and the ideas to go with it – but an absence of resources necessary to fully realize the innovation.
“The experience that these health workers had in these communities provided unique perspectives and ideas that produced the kinds of ideas that could be relevant,” said Ismail, now a Ph.D. student in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing.
“But because they were the lowest rung on the health infrastructure and were low income or low social class, those ideas weren’t recognized and represented.”
Around the same time, College of Computing alumnus Aditya Vishwanath, now a doctoral student at Stanford University, had a similar realization. He was working with Asha Mumbai, a non-profit in a low-resourced slum in India’s biggest city, using virtual reality to see how students appropriated and made sense of it. Like Ismail, he recognized a group of students who had unique viewpoints and drive, but too few resources to realize them.
Knowing how important it is to support innovation from those who understand the specific needs of a community, the two of them founded MakerGhat, a non-profit with the mission to take ideas from concept to creation and application where they are needed most: the communities they serve.
Situated in an impoverished neighborhood in Mumbai, MakerGhat is a community lab in which local students, young and old, can join to receive education and resources to put their ideas into practice. Makers join through subscription or scholarships if they are unable to afford membership. In exchange, they receive access to support ranging from an electronics room, a 3D printing and PC workstation, a science lab, a woodworking shop, and a design and workshop studio.
The space is intentionally unsophisticated. Enter the space, and you may find a mish-mash of supplies and painting on the walls, a far cry from the labs of the nearby Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, one of the top technological universities in India.
“We want people to be encouraged to try things and not afraid to break it,” Ismail said. “We don’t want something that people are afraid to use.”
If a maker can’t find what they are looking for, they can turn to connections within the community to meet the need. Heavier equipment, for example, might require a trip to the local smith for welding.
“Students coming in have family members in these other industries, so it sets up an informal infrastructure where the students know where to go for a specific need,” Ismail said.
The model has resulted in a number of tangible outputs. In Summer 2019, a handful of interns from Georgia Tech, Stanford, and Smith College were able to take advantage of the Denning Global Engagement Seed Fund to fund their travel to India. Interns were there not just to teach or run the lab, but to co-learn with locals. Collaborations between the technical expertise of the interns and the locally-significant knowledge of the makers resulted in a handful of innovations that addressed local needs.
One collaboration resulted in a system that could compact plastic bottles to assist in a waste management challenge in Mumbai. Workers who collect waste locally and transport to recycling plants to sell to companies or government institutions face challenges transporting plastic bottles, the most common waste item, which take up a lot of space.
Another created a community mapping platform to help identify local resources. Makers and interns went into the community and conducted surveys to find needs specific to different geographies.
“A big part of this is engaging with the community to identify needs, current status quos, and how to approach the challenge,” Ismail said. “This happens in the schools too. What are the gaps that need to be addressed, and how can we help address them?”
MakerGhat serves about 300 students weekly, ranging from young to old – it is open to any age or background. Many come from STEM fields, but others may be interested in math or art or fashion design.
“It’s a melting pot,” Ismail said.
The goal is to turn MakerGhat into an incubator. As the first class of students graduates from the program, they will move on to other sources of education or work. Ismail said that she and her collaborators – which includes Vishwanath, a team programmer, local leaders in finances and project resources, and a group of 10 or so volunteers – want to help build companies from the ideas and innovations that formed at MakerGhat.
“The mission is to actually transform these students and community members into entrepreneurs,” Ismail said. “We want to take these creations to the next level and help them scale beyond their own community."
That might mean launching new MakerGhat centers elsewhere. The goal is to make the model of the original open-source so that other communities can replicate – in India and beyond. While it may play out different in each location depending on the community’s needs, the organizational structure would be the same.
“There’s a misconception that great innovation only comes from these big tech companies or big universities,” Ismail said. “But we want to challenge that narrative. Many of the great ideas that can make significant impacts on society come from the people in these communities of need themselves.”
Other members of the Georgia Tech community have contributed to the project. Neha Kumar, an assistant professor joint between the School of Interactive Computing and the Sam Nunn School of International Affiars, is an advisor. Students involved in a Makers-in-Residence program last summer were Ritesh Bhatt, Solum Onwuchekwa, and Josiah Mangiameli. Vishal Sharma, an incoming IC Ph.D. student, was also involved.
Making Crime Data More Accessible and User Friendly
We use crime data to inform our decisions on where to move, what schools to enroll our children in, where to develop businesses, and more. Despite its impact on our decision making, however, most crime data reports cannot be understood by the average viewer.
Austin Wright, a Ph.D. student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), is hoping to correct this data divide in collaboration with Professor Scott Jacques from the Andrew Young School of Public Policy at Georgia State University (GSU).
Together, with data acquired by the GSU police department and other experts in the field, Jacques and Wright are working to develop novel data analysis and visualization tools to make crime and criminology data and trends more accessible.
“Currently, the availability of standardized and up-to-date crime incidence data from the federal government is complicated by the tools used for dissemination. Furthermore, the audience for whom this data is the most important, often does not have extensive training in data visualization and analysis; which can lead to erroneous conclusions or misleading charts in news publications or even in academic research,” said Wright.
By making the process of scraping up-to-date data easier, and then enabling subject matter experts to more effectively generate quantitative analyses, this research can make insights from existing data more readily available to those in academia and the general public.
The interdisciplinary project makes use of a wide variety of methodologies including human centered design practices, data visualization and automated data analysis, as well as computer science and social science analysis.
This cross-institute partnership is made possible through the GT-GSU Public Interest Technology (PIT) program, which was founded to support collaborations between technologists and social scientists. The PIT program specifically works to alleviate the continued equity challenges of the Southeast region and provides a model for regional PIT work focused on community challenges.

As part of this program, Wright was selected as a GT-GSU PIT Fellow for 2020 to develop research for crime data. His interest in this field came about after being introduced to Jacques through a meeting with School of Computer Science Regents’ Professor Ellen Zegura, the co-lead of the Civic Data Science and Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) Programs.
“During my first semester at Tech I focused on trying to build as many connections as possible with researchers in the space of trying to make machine learning and data science work for the public good. Luckily, Professor Zegura was in the process of setting up a cross-institute collaboration with Georgia State for just that purpose, which is now the PIT Fellows Program,” said Wright.
Meet CSE: Alexander Rodriguez is Creating Data-driven Solutions for Public Health Problems
The School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) offers a uniquely interdisciplinary pool of student researchers who specialize in bridging software and hardware together with real-world applications ranging from bioinformatics to cybersecurity and more.
Today, we’d like to introduce you to Alexander Rodriguez, a CSE Ph.D. student specializing in machine learning, network science, and time series mining with an emphasis on data-driven solutions motivated by urban computing, community resilience, public health, and e-commerce.
Currently, Rodriguez’s research has applications in a wide range of highly impactful areas including influenza and Covid-19 forecasting. Recently, his Covid-19 forecasts have been featured by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
[RELATED NEWS: Forecasting the Covid-19 Pandemic in the United States]
Hometown: Lima, Peru
Undergraduate Degree: Mechatronics Engineering
Current Program: Ph.D., Computer Science
Despite studying mechatronics, a field closely related to robotics, why did you decide to come to CSE?
When I was in my undergrad, I discovered the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and did a small AI project for robotics. I then found that machine learning (ML) was more closely related to the products and solutions I most care about. I was particularly interested in the fact that it provides methods with potential to make large impact in several disciplines in science and technology. In this regard, the school of CSE at Georgia Tech provides a great interdisciplinary environment for ML research that fits my interests.
What is important to you in your machine learning research?
To address impactful problems for society, enable new discoveries, and facilitate performance needed for particular applications. For example, we have to provide highly accurate disease spread forecasts as they will be input to high level decision makers determining public policies. We aim to develop machine learning tools to enable us to have greater accuracy in these predictions. Because of this and other examples, our ML group’s research provides a way to have a larger impact on society, and that is one of its allures for me.
Can you tell us a little bit about the specific research fields you are currently working in?
Related to disease forecasting, we are active participants in forecasting initiatives organized by the CDC for the past several years, like yearly flu forecasting projects. As Covid started, they naturally invited us to take part in forecasting Covid-related metrics such as mortality and hospitalizations. We worked in trying to incorporate domain knowledge into data-driven frameworks for forecasting. The goal is to enable experts to combine historical data with their expertise and key observations.
I also worked on critical infrastructure networks. We studied how to infer what the complete state of the network is given partial information. This problem is important because in real disaster scenarios, such as when we need to restore electrical power to hospitals in the aftermath of an earthquake, we need to quickly understand what the situation is with the network. To do this quickly and effectively, we usually need to infer the extent of damage using information coming from only a few nodes so that officials can plan recovery actions. We have worked on developing algorithms for that purpose.
How did you become interested in these particular fields?
I was working in data science for community resilience while getting my master’s degree at the University of Oklahoma. When I started working with Aditya Prakash, he had previously worked in critical infrastructure, and got interested in my past work. Therefore, we decided to pursue a related topic – about inferring network states – and it was the first project we did together
Aditya had already been working on epidemic forecasting, and I was also interested in that area of work because it not only can model the spread of a disease, but it also serves to understand other phenomena, such as how information is spread across information networks and also how failures spread in critical infrastructure systems. Understanding those fundamentals can allow us to make an impact in similar applications and I wanted to explore that with Aditya.
Why did you decide to come to Georgia Tech for your Ph.D.?
For me, I had a few offers from other Ph.D. programs, and my selection criteria was mostly dependent on my future advisor. I talked with several professors I was interviewing with, and I chose Aditya because I believed he was a good mentor. When he told me he was coming to Georgia Tech and invited me to come with him, I got excited about the opportunity and pleased for the chance to continue working with him.
I also knew Georgia Tech is a great institution with a lot of resources. To work in or near a major city means you are more likely to be in contact with greater global projects and presented with more opportunities to work with researchers and industry in other areas. I was very glad that he invited to come.
When you’re not busy with research or forecasting, what do you like to do for fun?
One thing that I enjoy, that people may not necessarily expect from a Ph.D. student, is dancing. Because I come from South America, I grew up dancing Salsa. I really like it and it is very relaxing for me. I also dance cumbia which is popular in Peru, and Argentina. For this, I might go to events organized by one of the university student clubs called GTSalsa.
New Device Helps Parents Keep an Eye on Children in Public Places
As parents know, it is not uncommon for children to wander off in public places. This is particularly true for children on the autism spectrum or with other special needs.
To address this challenge, a team of student entrepreneurs from Georgia Tech has created BuddyEye to help parents easily track and locate a lost child. The wristband uses a combination of Bluetooth and GPS technologies to alert parents when their child leaves a specified area.
During the research phase of their project, team members found that 60 percent of parents with children on the autism spectrum reported that their child had gone missing for more than an hour at least once. This can be distressing for children and parents alike, especially in crowded public spaces like zoos, shopping malls, or amusement parks.
“We wanted to give these and other parents another set of eyes to keep track of their children and an efficient way to find them should they wander off," said Tillson Galloway, Invenovate co-founder and second-year computer science student.
[RELATED: This Hybrid Mask is Easy to Make and Helps Prevent Disease Spread]
The developers are including software that alerts a store or other location that a child using BuddyEye is lost. Once alerted, store employees can lock doors, make appropriate announcements, and take other steps to help find the child quickly.
“BuddyEye provides a safety net. It vibrates, immediately notifying the parent when their child moves beyond a designated range. It also lets the child know that they are out of range so they will hopefully head back toward their parent,” said Galloway.
While the rest of the team – mechanical engineering students Alejandro Campos and Mark Saad, and Andre Prieto, an industrial design student from Universidad de las Américas in Ecuador – is primarily tasked with developing the hardware, Tillson is leading the charge on the application itself.
He says the BuddyEye platform is being developed using Facebook’s React Native, an open-source mobile application framework.
[RELATED: Fast Times at Student Startup as Global Client List Grows]
“What’s great about React Native is that it lets developers build apps for IOS, Android, and the web without having to separately code for each platform,” Galloway said.
The students behind BuddyEye are currently participating in Georgia Tech’s annual CREATE-X Launch program. Their startup company is known as Invenovate.
Although the CREATE-X Launch competition runs through the summer, BuddyEye has already earned a positive response.
The team also entered its product in the recently participated Ideas to Serve (I2S) competition sponsored by Georgia Tech’s Scheller College of Business. The team won first place and $2,500 in the Solutions Discovery Track of the annual I2S competition. They were also winners of the Best Pitch Award, which earned them an additional $500.
NSF Funds CRA Postdoctoral Fellowship Program to Bridge Job Market Gap
Many Ph.D. students will have difficulty finding academic jobs in the upcoming recession. To keep the research pipeline flowing, the Computing Research Association (CRA) has launched the Computing Innovation Fellows (CIF) 2020 program.
The program will fund at least 49 postdoctoral fellows in computing for a two-year career development experience. The National Science Foundation is funding the initial $16.8 million initiative.
Reviving the program
School of Computer Science Professor Ellen Zegura is the principal investigator (PI) on CIF 2020. As the chair of the CRA Board of Directors, Zegura said they anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout would impact graduating Ph.D. students, and have downstream effects on the U.S.’s computing research ecosystem.
“In late March and early April, CRA gathered data on how many academic departments were curtailing hiring to understand the scope of the problem,” she said. “Even at that time, this this led us to understand that many faculty positions were being pulled. We were wondering whether there was something CRA could be doing to be responsive to COVID-19.”
In response to the 2008 recession, CRA did something similar, funding more than 100 postdoctoral fellows and helping to popularize the fellowship model.
“This postdoctoral fellow idea bubbled up again because the circumstances were quite similar to 2008, but more drastic and quite sudden,” Zegura said.
This iteration of the program is also more flexible. Students can stay at their current institution but partner with a different advisor or work virtually with a mentor at a different university.
Matching researchers
Each candidate will identify a potential faculty mentor and can submit for the fellowship with up to two. There is a limit of two fellows and two mentors per institution to ensure this opportunity is spread across computing departments.
Although the NSF award has five PIs and a steering committee, there will also be a selection committee. These 8-10 faculty members broadly covering core computing research areas and will determine the matches.
Yet, according to Zegura, the goal is more than just bridging the job market gap. Each mentor and student pairing will plan a research topic and other ways the candidate can grow professionally, such as grant writing, teaching, or supervising junior students.
“This is supposed to be a time of growth,” Zegura said. “The postdoc experience really helps the person further the career.”
Application process
The application process is similar to faculty hiring processes to make it easy on applicants. Applicants will be required to submit: a research statement and plan, a mentoring plan written collaboratively with their proposed mentor, a curriculum vitae, and a few letters of recommendation. Students must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident or have received a Ph.D. from a U.S. institution.
As with all CRA endeavors, increasing diversity in computing will be important in the selection process, Zegura said. The selection committee will consider under-represented minorities in computing —including women and racial and ethnical minorities — and geography, such as rural versus urban areas.
“This is a great example of what CRA can do well,” Zegura said. “We feel so good about being able to do something for the community and do something that’s responsive to COVID-19.”
This Hybrid Mask is Easy to Make and Helps Prevent Disease Spread
A team of student entrepreneurs at Georgia Tech has developed a do-it-yourself hybrid mask and face shield to help people stay safe during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Using household items, the DIY mask/face shield can be made in 30 minutes or less and requires no 3D printing.
According to Tillson Galloway, a second-year computer science student and one of the creators, the hybrid mask/face shield is designed to be comfortable, convenient, and protect against micro-particles.
“Medical studies indicate that people touch their faces an average of 23 times an hour, which is one of the leading causes of infection. But, there is a shortage of medical-grade masks and most of the DIY masks people are using are uncomfortable, ill-fitting, and provide a false sense of security,” said Galloway, who is from Charleston, South Carolina.
“Our hybrid approach prevents people from inadvertently touching their faces because it fully covers the face.”
Dubbed ‘Project FREE: Face Masks Reducing Exposure for Everyone’ by the developers, the hybrid DIY mask/face shield is made using a baseball cap, a jacket zipper, a cotton blend t-shirt, and a clear plastic book cover.
Tools needed for the project include:
• Scissors
• Stapler
• Needle and thread
• Marker
• Ruler
“Using a ball cap creates much less strain than using elastic bands and the cloth prevents the shield from fogging up in humid conditions. The cloth can also be unzipped and is machine washable,” said Galloway.
FREE was submitted to a recent hackathon sponsored by Emory Global Health Institute and Georgia Tech. Although they did not win, Galloway says the team – which includes mechanical engineering students Alejandro Campos and Mark Saad, and Emory University neuroscience and behavioral biology student Aditya Jhaveri – received a lot of positive feedback.
With this feedback, the team is now working to refine the design, including evaluating the use of different types of household fabrics such as towels. Team members are also asking their friends and families to build the mask so they can evaluate the functionality, aesthetics, and simplicity of the product.
Along with improving its product the team is also incorporating in order to be able to legally accept donations. “We are partnering with local organizations in Atlanta, Charleston, and in Quito, Ecuador and will use donations to provide our hybrid mask/face shields to homeless people in these communities,” said Galloway.
According to Galloway, Quito is in the mix because it’s home to Andre Prieto, a member of another team that he, Campos, and Saad are a part of.
“Andre is an industrial design student at Universidad de las Américas in Quito. He is part of Invenovate, our team that is participating in this year’s CREATE-X Launch program at Georgia Tech,” said Galloway.
“Invenovate is a startup creating GPS enabled wristbands to assist parents in locating their loved ones with special needs. We’re in Create-X Launch this summer. But, COVID-19 has created a roadblock with our customer discovery and acquisition strategy, so we’re temporarily applying our skills to Project FREE so we can help promote public health and safety.”

Team Using Deep Learning to Forecast Pandemic in the U.S.
The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is hosting forecasting projects to predict the Covid-19 spread, number of hospitalizations, flu-like-symptoms, and deaths caused by the disease across the country.
This critically timed effort is comprised of a handful of teams which include data scientists, epidemiologists, statisticians, and high-performance computing (HPC) researchers from national laboratories, public universities, public health institutions, and some private sector agents.
Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Associate Professor B. Aditya Prakash and CSE Ph.D. student Alexander Rodriguez are leading one of the collaborative teams on these projects and are using a new data-driven approach to disease forecasting.
Their team is using deep learning models to forecast specific targets related to the trajectory of Covid-19 at the national, regional, state, and local levels. The CDC synthesizes their weekly and monthly predictions with other models to help determine policy and other planning decisions to help communities prepare for and fight the disease.
“We want to predict early to give lead times to decision makers to decide appropriately when to and how to allocate resources such as determining where to send ventilators, where additional beds are most critically needed, vaccine creation timelines, implementing temporary shelter in-place orders, whether additional guidance to state and local authorities is needed, and more,” said Prakash.
Prakash is an expert in using data science for epidemiology and infectious diseases and has been a lead team researcher on preexisting influenza forecasting projects with the CDC since 2018. He is also part of a recently awarded National Science Foundation (NSF) Expeditions in Computational Epidemiology grant that is actively working with multiple federal and state agencies to support response efforts for the current pandemic. Prakash’s portion of the project is aimed toward developing data science methods for public health problems ranging from epidemic detection to inference and control. He will also use Georgia Tech’s largest HPC resource, the Hive supercomputer, for running his large-scale models.
The Aid of a Public Health Surveillance Network
By using data captured by the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), and the Covid-19 Associated Surveillance Network, the forecasting teams are provided with real-time health data from health providers across the United States.
“Predicting when diseases will peak, when they will be above a certain baseline, when they will be below a baseline, and so on, is all very useful,” said Prakash. “The CDC has run similar influenza forecasting projects for the past few years in which all the teams taking part in the challenge forecast real-time predictions for flu-like illness across the US.”
“So, after Covid-19 started, naturally one big question that arose was, ‘Can we use this type of system to do Covid-19 forecasting?’,” he said.
After a few months of planning and working with various stakeholders like local and national health partners, and in consultation with the forecasting teams, the CDC set up multiple Covid forecasting projects, each predicting different metrics related to the trajectory.
“It was great to see these groups come together quickly,” said Prakash.
Current Benefits and Challenges Facing Forecasting Models
In addition to CDC ILI and Covid data, Prakash’s team is incorporating many other real-time datasets such as syndromic surveillance data and point-of-care data from leading providers. His team combines these datasets with domain knowledge using end-to-end deep learning models to predict targets on a weekly basis. Currently, their team - which includes University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Professor Jimeng Sun, Danica Xiao and Cheng Qiang of IQVIA, and Virginia Tech Professor Naren Ramakrishnan - is focusing more on near-term forecasts as opposed to very long-term projections.
However, according to Prakash, there are added challenges in tracking and predicting the Covid-19 disease spread for both traditional models and his team’s new deep learning model. This includes the fact that people are still learning about the epidemiology of the virus – such as the proportion of asymptomatic cases, new data surrounding the epidemic is being continuously added – such as new tests, and there is a large heterogeneity in the evolving US response – such as the wide variety of interventions and strategies implemented across the different states.
Another added challenge is that there is no real historical data to compare to, as it is a novel virus. For instance, Prakash’s team’s historical model was based on past influenza seasons. This will become even more challenging in the fall season when any Covid-19 cases will coincide with the usual flu season in the US.
Due to these added factors, Prakash’s team has to diligently avoid pitfalls of blanket assumptions from the model – an issue which they are addressing by adding an increased layer of interpretability for their model’s output. They hope that the forecasts help the decision makers see what they should expect in the near future.
“The coronavirus pandemic is like a natural disaster, if you can predict it earlier then that is better, as you want longer lead times to prepare. However, this is unlike weather forecasting, which also aims to help communities prepare. Human decisions do not change whether it is going to be sunny or not,” said Prakash.
“In contrast, human behavior can change the outcome of an epidemic. If we predict it’s going to be large outbreak, and everyone decides to stay home, it will fizzle out and nullify the prediction, and that’s a good thing! This is the tricky part of disease forecasting.”
Currently, one of the biggest challenges the forecasting teams face, stresses Prakash, is quickly detecting, predicting, and reacting if any secondary waves of infection begin.

Predicting Hate Crimes Targeting Asian Americans Amid Covid-19 Outbreak
As Covid-19 has spread across the globe, reports of harassment and cases of violent attacks aimed towards Asians and Asian Americans have dramatically increased.
Fortunately, researchers from Georgia Tech have found a way to track and predict these cases as, and potentially even before, they happen.
“In many unfortunate documented cases, xenophobic behaviors excited by the coronavirus have led to extreme physical harm to the victims and mental distress for others in the community. We are developing methods that leverage social media and news signals to measure how targeted hate and racism has spread worldwide, and use data-driven solutions to forecast future attacks,” said School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Assistant Professor Srijan Kumar.
Tracking Disease Spread and Monitoring Social Media to Predict Hate
Kumar and his lab, CLAWS, are developing a data science pipeline that uses epidemiological models of disease spread together with a database of social media and news reports to predict how online anti-Asian rhetoric spreads and how real-world cases of harassment will happen over time and in different places.
The data pipeline will combine online sources from news and social media platforms with offline sources, such as reports of physical abuse and racial incidents, to measure how targeted harassment is spreading in online and physical communities while comparing the spread side-by-side with the disease coverage.
There are five levels of harassment, with the first level being the least damaging. Each level after is subsequently more aggressive, with the fifth level including fatalities caused by hate crimes.
“We are coding up each incident with a corresponding number and then scraping news websites, collecting all the race incidents and physical abuse incidents in the real world, and essentially creating a timeline of how things have progressed,” said Kumar.
“Another piece of offline data we are collecting is the epidemiological spread of how the virus has progressed throughout the U.S. and the world. Our hypothesis is as this virus is spreading through different cities and different states, people get more alarmed and scared, and that anxiety leads to more online and offline hate and harassment in those particular cities,” he said.
Kumar’s team is the first ever to create a real-time database and pipeline that can forecast deviant behaviors using disease spread as an indicator.
“People are worried about their loved ones. The coronavirus has disrupted everyone’s daily routines. People have experienced loss of employment. There is a lot of economic, societal, and health hardship. These bring out very strong negative emotions in people and we see that both in the online platforms and also in the real world,” said Kumar.

Future Use Cases: Public Safety for Marginalized Communities
Recently, the FBI sent out warnings of potential hate crimes against Asian Americans and Minnesota opened a hotline to report such incidents after seeing a dramatic increase of cases since coronavirus began spreading in the U.S.
Kumar said, “We started seeing a lot of hate, harassment, and incidents against Asians and Asian-looking Americans very early on in the news cycle surrounding the coronavirus. It got us thinking how we could use these tools and technologies that we are developing in the lab to combat this phenomenon which is impacting everyone’s life. This is essentially about public safety for marginalized communities, which is a big issue.”
The pipeline Kumar’s team developed is general enough to be customizable to different actives, such as monitoring and predicting harassment of other minority groups, drug use, child abuse, suicides, and more.
“When pandemics or crises happen, there is an increase of public health and safety issues. So, we are using this particular framework as a first-use case to track and predict these problems and we plan to expand to others,” said Kumar.
As of this time, Kumar’s team is particularly interested in researching local Georgia cases and hope to work alongside and share their technology with local agencies, organizations, non-governmental organizations, and law enforcement in the future.
“This is a very sensitive and very important topic that can impact people around the world. And we are seeing these incidents not just in the U.S. but also in other countries such as India and Australia,” he said. “We hope that our tech can help improve people’s lives everywhere.”

Dellaert Awarded IEEE ICRA Milestone Award
Frank Dellaert, a professor in the School of Interactive Computing, and affiliated with the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) and GVU Center, has been honored with the IEEE ICRA Milestone Award at the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA.)
The award recognizes the most influential ICRA paper published between 1998-2002 and selected Monte Carlo Localization for Mobile Robots as this year’s recipient. Dellaert conducted this work during his Ph.D studies at Carnegie Mellon University with Dieter Fox, Wolfram Burgard, and Sebastian Thrun.
“It is a great honor to be recognized, but receiving a ’20 years on’ milestone award also makes you feel old!” said Dellaert.
The paper was accepted to ICRA in 1999 and introduced the Monte Carlo Localization (MLC) method or particle filter localization, which represents the probability density involved in maintaining a set of samples that are randomly drawn from it. This method is faster, more accurate, and less memory-intensive than earlier grid-based methods and allows a robot to be localized without knowledge of its starting location.
MCL is simple to apply to the robotics domain, leading to its popularity. It is now taught in every robotics 101 class around the world. Many mobile robots, including commercial efforts, rely on MCL for localizing.
“Simplicity is key for acceptance and you cannot predict which of your research will have the most impact. This paper was a result of me procrastinating on my Ph.D. thesis which is a paper almost nobody read. It is an enormous honor that MCL has made a lasting impact on our field,” said Dellaert.
ML@GT Faculty Members Will Discuss Projects Related to Covid-19 Relief During Virtual Panel
The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has wreaked havoc on the world, spurring researchers across disciplines into action to help human-kind. Four researchers affiliated with the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) and one Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) student examined different aspects of the virus’ impact. From creating forecasting models to studying the psychological impact of the disease, these researchers are helping people understand the virus.
On June 24, ML@GT faculty members Srijan Kumar (School of Computational Science and Engineering,) Aditya Prakash (School of Computational Science and Engineering,) Munmun De Choudhury (School of Interactive Computing,) Nicoleta Serban (H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering,) and OMSCS student Kenneth Miller will participate in a virtual panel discussing their work. The panel will be moderated by ML@GT executive director Irfan Essa.
Panelists will give individual presentations before participating in a general question-and-answer segment with audience members.
- Kumar and De Choudhury will share details of their work regarding the psychological impact of Covid-19. Kumar will also discuss his work examining hate and counter-hate messages on Twitter against Asian Americans during the pandemic.
- Prakash is a member of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) forecasting team, and will share their new data-driven approach to disease forecasting.
- Serban’s presentation will focus on her work creating an agent-based simulation forecasting model. This model captures the progression of the disease in an individual and in households, schools, communities, and workplaces.
- A lawyer by day and OMSCS student by night, Miller participated in a Kaggle challenge using natural language processing and machine learning to help doctors and scientists read the most important studies related to Covid-19.
The panel will take place virtually via a Bluejeans Event at 11 a.m. on June 24 and is open to the public. Registration is required.
School of Computer Science Professor Wins Award for Influential Cryptography Research
Professor Alexandra Boldyreva has won a Test of Time Award from the International Conference on Practice and Theory in Public Key Cryptography (PKC) for her work on new multi-user digital signatures.
Boldyreva, who is a professor and associate chair in the School of Computer Science, wrote the single-author winning paper, Threshold Signatures, Multisignatures and Blind Signatures Based on the Gap-Diffie-Hellman-Group Signature Scheme, in 2003 as a Ph.D. student at the University of California San Diego.
“My advisor had to convince me to write the paper because I thought the results were too simple to deserve a publication,” Boldyreva said. “Of course, back then I would have never believed that the paper would do so well.”
Her new multi-user digital signature schemes were simpler and more efficient than existing schemes at the time. One of the most useful was a multisignature that allows a number of users to jointly digitally sign the same message while keeping the final signature as short and computationally efficient as a single signature. In effect, the length of the multisignature doesn’t grow as more users sign.
Secure networking protocols as well as blockchains and cryptocurrencies commonly rely on efficient multi-user signatures. Yet, at the same time, the schemes Boldyreva created are still simple enough that introductory cryptography courses teach them.
Boldyreva gave a five-minute presentation on the paper at this year’s virtually held PKC.
“Now, I’m certain that simplicity is a big advantage as long as the result is useful or interesting.”
C4G BLIS Update Improves Usability, Could Prove Useful in Fight Against Disease Outbreaks
An update to a laboratory information system used in countries across Africa is improving usability and could prove critical in response to future disease outbreaks.
In 2010, a group of researchers at Georgia Tech, the CDC, and Ministries of Health in several African countries launched an open-source laboratory management system as part of the College of Computing’s Computing-for-Good (C4G) initiative. Designed to be ultra-configurable to meet variable needs of labs across developing countries with minimal training for staff, it quickly grew to become one of C4G’s biggest success stories.
More than 10 nations in sub-Saharan Africa adopted the program, called the Basic Laboratory Information System (BLIS), giving areas with little or poor internet connectivity an easy-to-use system for many who had minimal computing experience. These countries, which had over 1 million patients at the time, were using paper-based systems to manage information on disease spread, local illnesses, and much more. As information and communications technologies have expanded in the area, however, many labs gained a standardized reports system that could track prevalence rates of infections, slowing their spread.
But a lot can change in just 10 years. What was once designed for personal computing interfaces is now desired for a wide range of new platforms. Although laptops are still the device of choice for the majority of nurses – 79.6 percent reported in a study of a Nigerian hospital -- smartphones and tablets have seen a steady increase. The coming years will include many more innovations that render even those obsolete.
As users in the global south aspire to embrace mobile computing in clinical settings, a flexible interface, adaptable to everchanging applications, is needed.
Enter: Jung Wook Park and Aditi Shah, a Ph.D. student in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing (IC) and former master’s student in the School of Computer Science (SCS), respectively. Along with SCS Professor Santosh Vempala and IC Principal Research Scientist Rosa Arriaga, Park and Shah published research updating the current interface of C4G BLIS
Their updates focused on a handful of key areas, primarily mobile support. A responsive user interface framework supporting various screen sizes and resolutions was developed and evaluated by real users at hospitals in Africa currently using BLIS.
They compared user experience with the current interface on desktops and smartphones with a proposed interface on both and found that there was a significant improvement on both the desktop and smartphone.
“When you bring in a new system, they may feel uncomfortable with it,” Park said. “If we didn’t do a great job, you might get the same score or lower at the beginning. Over time, we saw improvements of 32 and 34 percent on desktops and smartphones.”
Shah, now at Microsoft, offered plenty of help in the development of the system, and her experience with a visual impairment allowed her to provide perspective on accessibility, as well.
The implications of this research extend far beyond ease of use for nurses, however. Park identified a growing problem across the globe in health care: communication. As the current pandemic can illustrate, viruses and diseases can spread quickly across many different populations. It isn’t sufficient to have just local data to mount an appropriate response; teams around the world must be able to rapidly share information.
A system like C4G BLIS, with its improved user interface that can be used across multiple platforms depending on the local needs of various communities, can help that communication.
“If you notice something locally and maybe other areas of the country or continent notice something, how do you know if it is a pandemic?” Park posed. “You need to be able to share that information to manage the spread. By turning these local systems into a standardized cloud-based system, we can improve communication.”
Already, Vempala said, he has heard reports from many labs that have adapted the flexible system to keep track of COVID-19 data in their communities.
The paper is titled Redesigning a Basic Laboratory Information System for the Global South, and was presented at the International Telecommunication Union Kaleidoscope conference, earning a Best Paper award.
Georgia Tech Professor Leads Multi-Institution Team in Combatting Hospital Acquired Infections
Researchers from Georgia Tech, University of Virginia, and the University of Iowa have teamed up to prevent, control, and intervene against hospital-acquired infection (HAI) outbreaks.
Detection and control of HAIs, such as Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), is a fundamental public health problem and a resource intensive challenge for hospitals. And with the spread of Covid-19 on the rise, the need to combat HAI outbreaks is more critical than ever.
Despite the huge importance for hospitals, and the interest from both clinical and epidemiological researchers, these problems remain poorly understood and all too common. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in thirty-one hospital patients in the United States are infected with at least one HAI on any given day. HAIs are particularly challenging because of the high cost of patient treatment and disinfection of hospital facilities, as well as penalties against hospitals if HAIs occur.
In an effort to combat the rate of HAIs, the cross-institute group of researchers, led by Georgia Tech School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Associate Professor B. Aditya Prakash, are creating a holistic approach to better understand, prevent, and treat HAI outbreaks by developing a network-based framework to improve hospital infection control.
Equipped with a $1.2 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), this three-year project aims to create a countermeasure toolkit to aid infectious disease experts.
“This will simultaneously improve care for current patients, make work safer for healthcare workers, and help prevent the incursion of Covid-19 into hospitals,” said Prakash.
“Our research brings together researchers from different backgrounds - data scientists, epidemiologists, hospital infection control experts and clinicians - in order to adopt a very interdisciplinary methodology. Through this, we aim to develop a new network-based approach that improves hospital infection control using data driven models and data science algorithms.”
A Holistic Approach
Given that each hospital is unique, the focus of the project is to design fundamental strategies and provide guidance for hospital infection control decision makers to determine what exact policies are best for each individual location.
Currently, there is limited data on HAI outbreaks, and the dynamics of HAI spread are more complex than other diseases due to several compounding factors. In response to these issues, the team says it is seeking a paradigm shift and will pursue a holistic view for this problem. The team will do so by modeling the disease spread using high dimensional clinical and mobility network data of healthcare workers and patients.
This type of data includes onsite surveys, RFID-type sensors, manual check-ins, anonymized electronic medical records, and more, to determine which areas are at higher risk for contagion exposure, who is most likely to come into contact with that area and with each other, and who may get eventually infected.
This research will use a unique fine-grained, large-scale dataset of operations from the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics collected over 10 years, supplemented with data collected from other hospitals. Results will be validated with the help of domain experts including epidemiologists and clinicians involved in hospital infection control.
These varying datasets will be combined to build a complete picture of disease transmission pathways to help hospitals quickly detect, understand, and control future HAI spread. To accomplish this, researchers will focus on multiple aspects of the infection control cycle: developing better surveillance techniques, more informed and carefully designed interventions, and more accurate exposure risk assessment tools.
“Building a comprehensive framework is very challenging because it is dependent on the layout of the hospital, the personnel, and how they all interact, in addition to the transmission characteristics of the disease itself. So, there are many combinations, which is why we need nimble models that can ingest heterogeneous dynamic data, leverage global information, and yet be useful at an individual level,” said Prakash.
To overcome these issues, researchers created a new class of two-mode cascade models to use throughout this project. This particular class has very different dynamics than current standard models used in heterogenous data analysis and has not been previously studied in data mining.
“These are difficult problems on networks, and we will invent rigorous and scalable methods using tools from data science, machine learning, and combinatorial optimization,” said Prakash.
The team expects their research will lead to novel computational methods and algorithms, in addition to guiding the next stage of advances in infectious disease practice.
New Training Data Labeling System for Machine Learning Helps Developers
Machine learning (ML) has become one of the most prominent forms of data analysis for everything from fraud detection to visual quality control. Yet the analytic results can often suffer from insufficiently labeled training data.
A team of Georgia Tech researchers has created a system that allows users to more effectively label a training dataset with higher accuracy than current methods.
“We are looking at the problem from a data management perspective,” said School of Computer Science (SCS) Assistant Professor Xu Chu. “In contrast to a lot of ML research that tries to tackle the lack of sufficient training data from an ML algorithm design perspective, we aim at building a system that helps users effectively label a dataset.”
The system, called GOGGLES, labels datasets using affinity coding, a paradigm that allows ML engineers to use various affinity functions that input two unlabeled examples and output a real-valued score.
“You can think of affinity as similarity,” said Chu. “The core premise of the work is that two examples share the same label if they are similar according to some affinity functions (or similarity functions).”
The benefits of affinity coding
GOGGLES uses a set of affinity functions that can capture various affinities found in the image. Next, using a new unlabeled dataset and these affinity functions, GOGGLES constructs an affinity matrix, from which it can assign classes to unlabeled images. This doesn’t require any metadata or developer intervention like previous .
For each new dataset, users can potentially reuse many of the existing affinity functions already in the library, making GOGGLES a domain-agnostic labeling system. Users and developers can always add more affinity functions to increase the labeling power of GOGGLES.
On five common image classifying tasks, GOGGLES reaches up to 98 percent accuracy without requiring extensive developer effort. It also outperforms other well-known data programming systems by up to 21 percent.
Chu co-wrote the paper, GOGGLES: Automatic Image Labeling with Affinity Coding, with Ph.D. students Nilaksh Das and Renzhi Wu, master’s alumni Sanya Chaba and Sakshi Gandhi, and School of Computational Science and Engineering Professor Polo Chau. They presented it at Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD) and Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS) held virtually from June 14 to 19.
Scientists Collaborating on New Data-Driven Approach to Covid-19 Intervention
As the number of Covid-19 cases rise in the United States and businesses reopen, health officials report that it is becoming increasingly difficult to conduct effective contact tracing and quarantine appropriately.
To help these officials, Georgia Tech researchers are collaborating with peers from the University of Virginia (UVA) to improve Covid-19 surveillance by designing more targeted and adaptive testing and intervention techniques.
Led by Georgia Tech School of Computational Science and Engineering Associate Professor B. Aditya Prakash, the team is developing these techniques using a new data-driven approach that brings together different types of datasets.
According to Prakash, standard preventative measures are proving to be substantially harder for scientists and public health experts to implement as infection rates continue to rise in many parts of the country. This is complicated further by factors such as asymptomatic transmission, high incubation periods, human mobility, weather patterns, and limited testing.
“The basic motivation [of our research] is that as the number of coronavirus cases rise, it becomes harder to target, quarantine, and prevent the spread of the disease,” said Prakash.
“To improve Covid-19 surveillance abilities in a data-driven fashion, we plan to augment and align different types of datasets. This will help us adaptively understand which new infections are more likely high risk, where we should focus our attentions on quarantine efforts, and also better model and understand the disease spread.”
Bolstered by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant, this project will integrate several datasets including line lists, which show case history, and other auxiliary data sets, such as census records, mobility and strain data. The project is attempting an ambitious approach that aims to bridge these widely contrasting data sets to create actionable insights.
Using these datasets, the researchers will computationally infer transmission chains to new infections.
“Our prior works on interventions and surveillance have been highly successful in this regard. Our inferred chains naturally give us guidance on whom to adaptively surveil and quarantine among the new infections,” said Prakash.
“We believe that the current patient line lists have a lot of missing information. This can be true for many diseases, but especially so in the case of Covid-19 where asymptomatic transmission seems to play such a large role in its spread,” he said.
“We are developing a sort of risk measure to understand where these missing clusters may be, such as near someone who is a highly mobile person living in a heavily populated area.”
Prakash and his UVA collaborators, including Biocomplexity Institute Professor Anil Vullikanti, have been working on epidemiological models for several years and have developed their own data sets for different geographical areas. As a proof of concept, their team is first focusing this research on the geographical regions of Georgia and Virginia and plans to extend later to other regions nationwide.
Apart from the immediate applications to the Covid-19 pandemic, the tools developed through this research will be broadly applicable to other infectious disease settings such as influenza.
The project will release its methods, which can be used by both practitioners and modelers for faster surveillance and testing under resource constraints.

Herrmann Honored with 2020 SEG Reginald Fessenden Award
Felix Herrmann is the recipient of the 2020 Reginald Fessenden Award, presented by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG). He is receiving this award with Charles (Chuck) Mosher, of ConocoPhillips, which recognizes their pioneering work in the development and application of compressive sensing (CS) in seismology.
Borrowing from electrical engineering and mathematics, they have shown how new theories can be utilized to efficiently acquire higher quality seismic surveys at costs much lower than that afforded by traditional methods. These two award winners did not directly work together, but they both benefitted from each other’s contributions and set an exemplary example of how technical success can be achieved by the interaction between academia and industry. Their efforts are establishing the new paradigm for seismic acquisition, and their innovations are deserving of this prestigious award.
Such concepts as sampling interval and aliasing have been well established, but these concepts are based on regularly discretizing a continuous signal. Irregular sampling allows CS to avoid the traditional Nyquist criteria of sampling two points per wavelength to eliminate aliasing. This opens the possibility for sparser sampling while maintaining or enhancing bandwidth and managing incoherently aliased energy. This is the basic premise of CS, but there are significant hurdles in implementing any new approach for effective use in the field. Questions such as how to acquire irregularly sampled field data, represent it in a compressed form, deblend simultaneous sources, and perform a sparse inversion to reconstruct the desired output data are among the key challenges Herrmann and Mosher have addressed successfully.
Herrmann joined the Georgia Tech faculty in 2017 as a professor in the Georgia Tech School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and as a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Energy. He holds joint appointments in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the School of Computational Science and Engineering. While a professor at the University of British Columbia, Herrmann led the industry-supported SINBAD consortium from 2005-2017. The focus of this consortium was on applications of CS for cost reduction of seismic acquisition, seismic processing, and seismic imaging. Herrmann and his colleagues addressed sampling-related cost of seismic acquisition by using CS wavefield reconstruction methods based on randomized sampling techniques and simultaneous shooting in land and marine acquisitions.
Through several publications, he and his team demonstrated that a signal can be represented sparsely, interference (aliasing) can be rendered into incoherent noise by random sampling, and a nontraditional optimization algorithm can recover the desired signal from the sparse representation. Key areas in which Herrmann has contributed are: seismic data processing, wave equation imaging, and full-waveform inversion (FWI). In seismic processing, he has shown that multidimensional data can either be sparsely represented using a curvelet transform or in low-rank factored form. Given these structured representations, Herrmann demonstrated how seismic wavefields can be reconstructed from severe undersamplings by promoting structure via optimization. He showed how to represent primary reflections with a sparse spike inversion, which also draws on new techniques from modern convex optimization. In wave equation imaging, he has shown how statistical sampling of shots, in combination with curvelet-domain sparsity promotion, can yield impressive cost reductions of reverse time migration and FWI. He and his team also were responsible for the development of wavefield reconstruction inversion, a new technique designed to mitigate the impact of local minima. Finally, he was selected as the SEG 2019 first-quarter/second-quarter Distinguished Lecturer to present “Sometimes it pays to be cheap — Compressive time-lapse seismic data acquisition,” which focuses on obtaining repeatable time-lapse data without insisting on replication in the field.
Mosher and his team at ConocoPhillips have also made significant advances that are currently realizing the potential of CS in acquisition and processing. Mosher extends the windowed Fourier transform to a fast generalized windowed transform by introducing fractional decimation concepts to overcome sub-band aliasing artifacts, and this provides a sparse transform to represent data with fewer samples. He and his team developed nonuniform optimal sampling for choosing nonuniform sensor locations for seismic survey planning and prove that the new sampling strategy makes it possible to recover significantly broader spatial bandwidth than could be obtained using uniform sampling. CS data reconstruction is an important step, and Mosher and his team developed an effective seismic data reconstruction workflow. They also introduced a novel optimization algorithm for data reconstruction, which adapts the alternating direction method with a variable-splitting technique to recover a sparse representation of the seismic data. Source deblending is an important step, and they have demonstrated how this can improve seismic data quality with reduced acquisition time and cost.
To date, ConocoPhillips and its business partners have acquired 17 CS data sets globally, including ocean-bottom node/cable, narrow-azimuth marine streamer, and land vibroseis surveys. For all the finished processing projects, the imaging results from the CS surveys exceeds the quality of legacy or neighboring surveys with traditional designs. The paradoxical result is that CS theory produces higher data quality at lower cost and in shorter time frames than would be achieved with equivalent traditionally sampled survey designs. To date, global deployments of CS technology in production have led to direct acquisition cost savings of more than US$165 million and indirect cost savings of US$180 million from optimized drilling decisions.
Alum is Recognized for Outstanding Dissertation in High-Performance Computing
A School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Ph.D. alumnus has been selected for the prestigious (ACM) SIGHPC Dissertation Award for 2020.
The winning alum, Patrick Flick, is the first recipient in Georgia Tech history to receive the award which honors one outstanding doctoral dissertation focused on high-performance computing (HPC) research each year.
The winning dissertation, Parallel and Scalable Combinatorial String Algorithms on Distributed Memory Systems, offers a new approach to solve large-scale string and graph problems used throughout computational biology applications. The computational methods introduced in Flick’s work achieve efficient and scalable execution on large-scale distributed compute clusters, achieving solutions to increasingly larger problems.
Inspired by the advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing which enables generations of billions of reads per minute, and the growing need to find a computational approach that can keep pace, this research expands on prior theoretical approaches. The resulting algorithms and data structures implemented by Flick advance the state-of-the-art by providing improved theoretical complexity and better practical performance, while minimizing overall and per-node communication volume within a computer’s distributed memory architecture.
Ultimately, these findings offer a more efficient method to represent, construct, and query data structures for large-scale and memory intensive applications in text processing, information retrieval, and computational biology.
Flick joined CSE for his Ph.D. in 2014 under the guidance of CSE Professor and Interim Chair Srinivas Aluru.
According to Aluru, “Patrick's Ph.D. work addresses some notoriously difficult problems in parallel string algorithms, and his dissertation gets it just right by providing both theoretical optimality and practical efficiency. His work, all published in top forums in the field, has lasting value. It is gratifying to see him win this year's ACM SIGHPC Dissertation Award.”
Flick defended his thesis in March 2019 and officially graduated the following May. He is now a software engineer at Google.
Flick’s previous successes include authoring the first paper used for the Student Cluster Reproducibility Challenge at Supercomputing 2016 and winning the Best Student Paper Award at Supercomputing 2015.
SIGHPC is the ACM’s special interest group that focuses on providing a platform for high-performance computing (HPC) research and efforts internationally. The ACM SIGHPC Dissertation Award pulls from this professional society in an effort to highlight innovative and prolific research in the supercomputing and parallel processing fields.
The 2020 ACM SIGHPC Dissertation Award includes a $2,000 honorarium, travel support to the Supercomputing Conference, and an award plaque.
Control Circuit for DIY Ventilator Empowers Patients
When Georgia Tech mechanical engineering students created a 3-D-printed ventilator to help the shortage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, it was the work of School of Computer Science (SCS) Ph.D. student Prithayan Barua that made their design standout.
Barua created the control circuit that enables the ventilator to be run remotely.
When lockdown started in early March, Barua’s friend Prasoon Suchandra, a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering, reached out for volunteers to develop a control circuit for their emergency low-cost ventilator project led by Devesh Ranjan, a professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering.
“I had some experience in developing such circuits and programming the controllers, so I decided to help them,” said Barua, who normally works on program analysis and compiler optimizations for SCS Professor and incoming Chair Vivek Sarkar’s Habanero Extreme Scale Software Research Lab.
Power of the control circuit
Since the Covid-19 pandemic started, people across the world have been building makeshift ventilators, but most of them have no or minimal controls and work only on sedated patients.
“Without the control circuit, a medical professional has to manually monitor and control all such parameters for patient safety,” Barua said.
A control circuit makes it possible to control and monitor all the different vitals that doctors need for any ventilator to be useful: respiration rate, tidal volume — a measure of how much air is inhaled in a breath — inspiration and expiration ratio, and pressure on lungs.
Yet the control circuit also empowers the patient. Barua added sensors and a RaspberryPi controller that reads the sensors, performs some numerical computations, and updates a user interface continuously in a loop, eliminating the need for a medical professional to be present.
A patient can support the volume of air delivered, time their breathing, and cough without fighting the ventilator. In effect, the ventilator reduces the involvement of a medical professional.
Future of the ventilator
Making a functional ventilator was one of the goals of the project.
“Our entire team has spent a lot of effort on developing a design that can be really useful in the current situation,” Barua said. “We have interacted with different doctors and hospitals and taken their feedback into account.”
The team has also ensured that it can be manufactured cheaply with easily available raw materials almost anywhere in the world. They hope to openly release the design, so that anyone can mass manufacture it. They are also exploring partnering with a few potential companies around the world to manufacture the ventilator. Whoever manufactures it will get the required certifications and have legal liability for the device.
Research to reality
Although the work doesn’t overlap much with his typical research, Barua applied some approaches he uses in his work on optimizing the memory access patterns on graphics processing units (GPUs). For the ventilator project, he selected, updated, and processed appropriate data structures to optimize the program. He also applied simple parallelization methods like multiprocessing to achieve the right sampling rate for the RaspberryPi.
“It was interesting to see the ventilator being built from scratch in the workshop, working with oscilloscopes to debug our circuit in the electronics lab, and developing programs to control actual mechanical systems,” he said.
For Barua, the main goal was having a positive impact during the pandemic and collaborate on a real-world problem.
“This project was also unique since we were remotely collaborating with a very big team from different departments including the Georgia Tech Research Institute. It was a great learning experience.”
Facial Recognition Software Needs Human Subject Experiments
Facial recognition software is becoming the go-to security measure for businesses, but it can be inaccurate and racially biased. Although many companies have proposed adding human intervention to mitigate this, a Georgia Tech researcher says human-subject experiments must be a priority before human intervention is considered a one-size-fits-all solution.
“Humans are biased themselves, so how can you resolve an issue of bias with a human?” School of Computer Science Ph.D. alumna Samira Samadi said. “It might even make it worse.”
The limits of facial recognition
Facial recognition software supposedly automates building security. The software takes photos as people enter a building, which it then cross-references with an employee database. If the software finds a match, a person can enter the building.
Despite many advances in image recognition and artificial intelligence, systems are often more accurate for men with lighter skin tones and less for women with darker skin tones. Companies have proposed adding a human evaluator to compensate for the software’s limitations.
Yet Samadi, who researches algorithmic fairness, immediately recognized the potential for more bias. She wanted to know whether adding a human evaluator to the process increases fairness or bias.
Experimental design
Yet designing such a human/user study is challenging as Samadi and colleagues at Microsoft Research realized. Working with actual security guards or receptionists would be ideal, but was not feasible in practice.
Samadi, pictured above, turned to recruiting people through Mechanical Turk as she had done in the past. These users would offer her volume, but they were not trained in recognizing faces. First, she studied how to compare faces. Then she learned how to teach Mechanical Turk users about facial recognition systems, how to make decisions about the accuracy of the system, and how to be confident in that decision.
After research, Samadi developed a user study and did some trials with friends to ensure the study was clear and understandable. Then she ran the study on 300 users on Mechanical Turk.
Each user was trained on how to distinguish faces and evaluate the software. Next, the user saw two images and how they were scored by the software. Samadi expected the human evaluator would show bias between two lighter versus dark-skinned people, but the results were much different.
Future studies
“We really tried to imitate a real-world scenario, but that actually made it more complicated for the users,” Samadi said.
The researchers were unsure whether the problem with the study was because users didn’t understand the study or that there was biased behavior, but they ultimately decided not to publish the research. However, Samadi did publish a position paper, A Human in the Loop is Not Enough: The Need for Human-Subject Experiments in Facial Recognition, with Microsoft Research’s Farough Poursabzi-Sangdeh, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, and Hanna Wallach. Samadi presented the work at the Conference on Human Factors in Computer Systems (CHI) in April.
The paper argued about both the necessity and issue with studies like these. There are four main challenges about both the efficacy and generalizability with a human-subject study like the one they conducted:
-Datasets: Finding an appropriate dataset is difficult for a number of factors: Sourcing images ethically is challenging because past research has relied on celebrity or politician images who are easily recognizable and thus bias the study. Many datasets are also already biased and contain more lighter-skinned faces than darker. Also, many datasets are higher quality than what would be found in camera footage and not an effective real-world comparison.
-Participants: Many available participants for studies like these are students or Mechanical Turk workers who are inexperienced in facial recognition.
-Context: Recognizing faces in an experiment is not comparable to on the job duties when an unfamiliar person may be a threat.
-User Interface: Companies do not release their user interfaces for facial recognition software, leaving it up to researchers to design something that may not reflect what is used in real-world software.
“If someone wants to attack this problem in the future, they should know the challenges they have ahead of them,” Samadi said.
Park Named as New School of Computational Science and Engineering Chair
The College of Computing is proud to announce the appointment of Haesun Park as the new chair of its School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE).
“Haesun is not only a cutting-edge researcher, but has experience managing cutting-edge researchers, including for the National Science Foundation,” said Charles Isbell, Dean and John P. Imlay, Jr. Professor of the College of Computing. “She will be a valuable leader for the School of Computational Science and Engineering and for the College of Computing, and I look forward to working with her.
Park joined the School of Computational Science and Engineering in 2005 and has been a Regents’ Professor since 2019. During that time she served as the associate chair of the school and participated in creating new Ph.D. and MS degree programs in CSE. She also served as the executive director of the Center for Data Analytics, and as the director of the NSF-funded Foundations of Data and Visual Analytics Center. Before coming to Tech, Park served as a program director in the Computing and Communication Foundations Division at the National Science Foundation.
Park is a fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) and of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). She is an internationally respected leader in the areas of numerical computing, data analysis, and visual analytics. She has made significant fundamental contributions to the advancement of computational methods and tools through groundbreaking research that impacted many real-life applications.
“Georgia Tech has been a pioneer in the academic discipline of Computational Science and Engineering,” Park said. “I am honored to serve as chair, especially at a time when the field is reaching into so many new areas of life and society. I look forward to working with the communities in the school and across campus as we endeavor to expand our field and move it to the next level.”
Park will be taking the reins from Srinivas Aluru, professor and executive director of the Institute for Data Engineering And Science (IDEaS), who has served as interim chair for the past year.
“I’d like to thank Srinivas for taking this leadership position," Isbell said. "He did so while being the Executive Director of the Institute for Data Engineering and Sciences, and he kept that organization moving forward as well. I know doing both was difficult, but he knew his school and his college needed him, and he rose to the challenge."
Park will begin as chair on Monday, August 10. Please join Dean Isbell in congratulating her and the School of Computational Science and Engineering on this new chapter.
Two IC Grads Earn Sigma Xi Best Ph.D. Thesis Awards
Recent Georgia Tech Ph.D. graduates Caitlyn Seim and Aishwarya Agrawal, both from the School of Interactive Computing, were awarded the 2020 Sigma Xi Best Ph.D. Thesis Award. They were two of just 10 Ph.D. students at Georgia Tech recognized with the honor.
Seim’s thesis, titled Wearable Vibrotactile Stimulation: How Passive Stimulation Can Train and Rehabilitate, presents a technique in which a vibrating wearable device is used to retrain motor function following debilitating occurrences of spinal fracture or stroke. Now a postdoc at Stanford University and a fellow with the National Institutes of Health, Seim is currently working with stroke survivors to develop accessible and functional wearable devices to reduce physical disability in both the upper and lower limbs.
“Lately, I have also developed new mechanical tools to assess hand and arm function when there are no quantitative clinical tests available,” Seim said. “I plan to continue research on wearable and ubiquitous systems for health, accessibility, and training.”
In Agrawal’s thesis, titled Visual Question Answering and Beyond, she explores a multi-modal artificial intelligence task called visual question answering. In this task, given an image and natural language question about it, a machine is programmed to automatically produce an accurate natural language answer. The applications of VQA include aiding visually impaired users in understanding their surroundings, aiding analysts in examining large quantities of surveillance data, teaching children through interactive demos, interacting with personal AI assistants, and making visual social media content more accessible.
Now at DeepMind and soon to be an assistant professor at the University of Montreal and Mila, an AI research institute, Agrawal intends to equip current VQA systems with better skills to move toward artificial general intelligence.
“In the long term, I am excited about science fiction becoming reality, when we all have smart virtual assistants that can see and talk and serve as an aid to visually impaired users,” she said.

New Tool Brings Fuzzing Approach to Memory System Security
Heap allocators manage one of the most common types of memory. Georgia Tech researchers have created an automated tool that reveals how exploitable they are, though.
Unlike other heap exploitation techniques that require considerable effort from the researcher, ArcHeap can autonomously explore the system.
“Many heap exploitation techniques have been discovered by researchers; however, this task always relies on manual efforts,” said School of Computer Science (SCS) Ph.D. student Insu Yun. “We wanted to automate this process.”

Heap exploitation techniques
Heap is dynamically allocated memory, or memory that’s size is determined during program execution. Heap allocators manage it efficiently, yet they are also very susceptible to attack.
Exploitation techniques abuse underlying heap allocator mechanisms to exploit vulnerabilities. Popular systems software is plagued by heap-related vulnerabilities. Microsoft said heap vulnerabilities led to more than half of their security problems in 2017. Heap vulnerability attacks have also been seen in popular software such as WhatsApp, VMware, and Eximail in 2019.
Since each exploit is specific to the allocator, previous research was specialized and manually done. This created a barrier to understanding security issues with various heap allocators and led to even more attacks.
How ArcHeap works
ArcHeap introduces operations and attack capabilities to see if these trigger an exploitation. The approach is comparable to fuzzing, an automatic software testing technique that inputs random data to expose vulnerabilities.
“We found that fuzzing is very useful for finding software vulnerabilities, so we extended this idea into discovering heap exploitation techniques,” Yun said. “However, classical fuzzing cannot be naively applied to this new problem, so ArcHeap employs several new ideas.”
The researchers determined heap allocators share common design components that allowed them to abstract enough so that the tool can be applied to any allocator. ArcHeap also synthesizes its finding as it moves through the allocator to reduce redundancies.
ArcHeap’s findings
Researchers evaluated ArcHeap on 11 allocators and found five new exploitation techniques in Linux's default allocator, ptmalloc2. Despite decades of research in this area, ArcHeap successfully discovered heap exploitation techniques in ptmalloc2.
“Our results show that their manual security analysis was insufficient to cover a large space of heap exploitation techniques,” Yun said. “As a result of this insufficient manual testing, these allocators were actually not secure as their claims.”
They also found vulnerabilities in seven of the 10 other popular allocators.
Although right now ArcHeap can determine if a heap allocator is vulnerable or not, the researchers hope to put a quantitative value on that security in the future.
They presented the research in the paper, Automatic Techniques to Systematically Discover New Heap Exploitation Primitives, at Usenix’s 29th Security Symposium from August 12 to 14. Yun co-wrote the paper with SCS Associate Professor Taesoo Kim and Facebook’s Dhaval Kapil.
Faculty Uses Computation to Understand Cellular Mechanisms
The intersection of computation and biology allows researchers to understand the mechanisms that control gene functions in cells and better understand disease.
For Xiuwei Zhang, an assistant professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), this intersection also provides a space to help physicians and biologists alike through her research in mathematics and computer science.
While working on her master’s program at Tsinghua University, Zhang was introduced to the then-novel field by a professor who would eventually become the supervisor for her master’s thesis.
“Professor Zhidong Deng had just come back to China from the U.S. and quickly introduced an area known as computational biology to the computer science department at Tsinghua University,” she said.
“He introduced a groundbreaking problem that aimed to computationally predict the structure of RNAs. I thought it was very interesting and if I was going to choose a research direction with computer science, then biology was a great field to apply it to. Not only does it help us understand more about our own bodies, it is also a fascinating combination of engineering and science,” she said.
Zhang joined CSE in fall 2019 and is part of the school’s research expansion into the bioinformatics field.
Her research specifically focuses on data science, method development, and data analysis with an emphasis on computational biology.
“In a healthy organism, we need to make sure the right genes are functioning in every cell. Understanding which mechanism controls each gene function in a cell and its regulators allows scientists to build a network showing the full mechanism,” said Zhang.
Currently, Zhang’s research group at Georgia Tech is working to integrate multimodality data on a single cell level. The goal of their research aims to combine different data types together to study the cellular mechanisms in single cell organisms.
“What we really want to understand is what is controlling all the changes in the cells and track their differences. On a mechanism level, we need to not only look at the RNA sequencing data but also integrate other types of data such as protein analysis,” she said.
Zhang’s other research focus is on regular network inference methods, which examine the regulatory relationships and controls of each cells to determine how and why certain genes are functioning.
A group of researchers from Karolinska Institute of Sweden are developing a method to infer RNA velocity which determines how fast a gene’s expression will increase or decrease in each cell. Zhang’s team is building off of this recent work which makes novel use of the predicted RNA velocity. Their goal is to develop a graph algorithm that takes the data from RNA velocity to output estimated trajectory of cells. These trajectories allow researchers to track different biological processes in the set of cells under study.
“We want to infer the gene regulatory networks from single cell RNA sequencing data using computational methods. These networks represent the interactions between genes and proteins in cells, thus provide important information on the mechanisms in cell development and diseases. But we first need to aggregate the data from many cells and then sort the cells to then determine the trajectory of the cells,” she said.
Zhang joined CSE after working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department at the University of California (UC) at Berkeley. While at UC Berkeley, her time centered on two different projects, each using single-cell sequencing. One project, called SymSim, published in the Nature Communications Journal, developed a simulator to model processes observed during single cell RNA sequencing experiments.
According to Zhang, the SymSim simulates single cell RNA data which allows researchers to benchmark various computational methods.
Zhang has won several distinguishing awards in the areas of computational biology and data analysis, including:
· Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Fellowship for Prospective Researchers, 2012
· SNSF Advanced Postdoc Mobility Fellowship, 2014
· Simons-Berkeley Research Fellowship, 2016
OMSCS Shines at Top Educational Technology Conference
Georgia Tech continues to be one of the stars at Learning @ Scale (L@S), the Association of Computing Machinery’s annual conference celebrating digital learning. With 17 research projects and students presiding over the conference, the College of Computing is one of the leaders in this space.
David Joyner, the executive director of the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) and online education, and OMSCS student Robert Schmidt are on the organizing committee. Joyner is also involved in the steering and programming committees.
OMSCS’s influence also extends to research with five full papers and 12 short papers on everything from plagiarism to peer evaluations.
“The most remarkable thing to me is the number of students, including online students, with work at the conference,” Joyner said. “It’s evidence that OMSCS students have a thirst for research opportunities and will make the most of them when they have them.”
Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the digital learning community had planned to gather Aug. 12-14 in Atlanta for this year’s conference. If there was any conference that could be virtual, however, it’s one devoted to online learning.
Still, there were challenges to moving everything online. Schmidt is in charge of organizing workshops and had to determine how to move everything to Zoom.
“There are a lot of questions you need to ask to prepare,” he said. “Do you have multiple computers? What do you do if the network goes down? It’s about making sure all software works before the session starts, and that you have everything you need in front in you.”
Yet Schmidt is confident they are prepared.
“At OMSCS, we’re experts in this,” he said.
Research Analyzes Scalable Degree Landscape
When the Online Master of Science Computer Science (OMSCS) started in 2014, it was touted as one of the first affordable degrees at scale with many following. Yet, new Georgia Tech research suggests that affordable degrees at scale may have more similarities to traditional online programs than differences.
OMSCS researchers set out to determine how these degrees, known as large internet-mediated asynchronous degrees, compared to online degrees from traditional institutions. They collected data on tuition, admission standards, curriculum, and assessments to evaluate students from 61 massive open online course (MOOC) programs.
“It’s one of our first attempts at understanding what affordable and scalable degrees are available,” said OMSCS alumnus David Park.
Their findings are that MOOC-based programs are providing a valued education without compromising quality. They also found traditional online programs offered at similar price points.
MOOC Observations
Although distance learning has always been a feature of higher education, the MOOC model promised affordable education at scale. Yet researchers learned many programs from MOOCS to traditional universities with online degrees also offer competitive pricing.
There were additional observations when researchers looked at how each program operates. Many used MOOC platforms, such as Udacity or Coursera, in conjunction with more traditional management systems for grading and assignment submission. This suggests the MOOC platform isn’t entirely necessary for education at scale.
Program data is also not as accessible as the MOOC format suggests. The researchers had difficulty finding data they needed, such as course syllabi, the number of teaching assistants, and how academic integrity is maintained. According to the research, this may be because programs are just starting and still developing syllabi.
“There’s a disparity of information out there,” said OMSCS student Robert Schmidt. “We had a difficult time getting information we needed, as we researched public information as well as made multiple contacts to universities.”
Program requirements and structure were also not universal. Many programs have variable admissions standards to make them more attractive for nontraditional students, such as waiving GRE requirements.
“As we have a growing number of MOOC-based programs, the question we should be asking as researchers is how we can ensure the quality of the program going forward,” Park said.
The researchers believe this area is ripe for further research as more programs come online.
“There’s so much in this field left to research,” Schmidt said. “We’re at the beginning of this evolution.”
The researchers present their work, Affordable Degrees at Scale: New Phenomenon or New Hype?, at Learning @ Scale in August. Park and Schmidt wrote the paper with OMSCS alumni Charankumar Akiri and Stephanie Kwak, and OMSCS Executive Director David Joyner.

Researchers Identify New Internet Congestion Problem
Georgia Tech researchers have identified a new congestion problem and have created a new congestion control scheme to alleviate the slowdown. Annulus decreases datacenter bottleneck by up to 3.5 times and improves datacenter traffic by 56 times when the connect is from the wide area network (WAN).
As the cloud continues to bring easy data storage to billions, operators are pushing their networks to peak efficiency to reduce costs. Datacenters are designed with the expectation that there will be more internal data than external, but as more people join the cloud, this paradigm is no longer true, according to the researchers.
Cloud conundrum
As soon as the cloud became a prominent data storage method, cloud operators started leasing compute, storage, and network resources to their clients. The rise in demand for these resources means that networks are now more overloaded than ever.
Cloud providers’ solution to the influx of computers on the network was to allocate more resources than necessary. Yet this isn’t cost effective, according to School of Computer Science (SCS) alumnus Ahmed Saeed.
The cloud is made of interconnected datacenters. One machine in a datacenter can send traffic to other machines in the same datacenter and others outside of it. This is further complicated by data transmission speed, or latency, which is very fast inside the datacenter. However, the latency between datacenters is much longer because data must travel across the country through the WAN.
When both types of traffic compete, the faster reacting type of traffic shoulders the burden of reacting to any changes in network conditions, harming overall performance. This problem can be ignored when the demand of the slow traffic is low, but as the demand increases, the problem becomes more prominent.
“When the bandwidth demand of datacenter-to-datacenter traffic is small, it is not very costly to dedicate that bandwidth within the datacenter network,” Saeed says. “However, as that demand increases, dedicating resources can be wasteful.”
If the network is bottlenecked, the datacenter traffic will immediately sense the problem and compensate for it. However, WAN traffic will take much longer. In effect, the entire network becomes 2.5 times less inefficient before all parts of the network are aware of it.
“Information has to travel from one data center through the WAN and back,” said Saeed. “It’s problematic.”
Congestion control
When demand for network bandwidth is larger than available capacity, the part of the network responsible for handling traffic is called congestion control. This is a fundamental concept in network research and how the internet functions. Yet this efficiency issue between datacenter traffic and WAN traffic has led to a new type of congestion, and the solution has to be time focused, according to Saeed.
“It’s not a matter of how good your network signal is or how smart your algorithm is, but how fast you react,” he said.
With this in mind, the researchers worked to the solve the problem in the datacenter, not through the end points. Annulus works by sending a message from the congested part of the network to the traffic source to let it know how to react, essentially cutting out the middleman.
Annulus has two control loops. One uses existing congestion control algorithms for bottlenecks at just one source, either the WAN or the datacenter. The other loop focuses on bottlenecks between the WAN and the datacenter and tries to solve the problem at the traffic source.
When tested, Annulus improves datacenter traffic by 56x when the bottleneck is the WAN. It also reduces datacenter flow issues by up to 3.5x.
Saeed presented the research in the paper, Annulus: A Dual Congestion Control Loop for Datacenter and WAN Traffic Aggregates, at the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM) from Aug. 10 to 14. He co-wrote the paper with SCS’s Professors Mostafa Ammar and Ellen Zegura, and Varun Gupta, Prateesh Goyal, Milad Sharif, Rong Pan, Keon Jang, Mohammad Alizadeh, Abdul Kabbani, and Amin Vahdat.
New Toolchain Automatically Finds Database Management System Bugs
Georgia Tech researchers have applied fuzzing techniques to find bugs in database management systems (DBMS). Their new toolchain APOLLO automatically detects, reports, and diagnoses a common DBMS bug.
APOLLO automates the generation of regression-triggering queries, simplifies the bug reporting process for users, and enables developers to quickly pinpoint the root cause of performance regressions.
The researchers discovered 10 previously unknown and unique performance regressions, reduced query size by 4.2 times, and identified branches related to the root cause.
DBMS problems
The complexity of DBMS increases their potential for error. An upgrade on a DBMS can unexpectedly slow down certain queries, a problem known as a performance regression bug.
“A critical regression can reduce performance by orders of magnitude, in many cases converting an interactive query to an overnight execution,” said SCS Ph.D. student Jinho Jung.
To improve this issue, the researchers used the toolchain approach, a pipeline of distinct software development tools that are linked together by specific stages.
The team’s new toolchain has three components:
SQLFuzz
SQLFuzz generates structured query language (SQL), the language databases communicate with, to find performance regressions. It works by bombarding a system with many randomly generated inputs to trigger bugs, a technique known as fuzzing.
“During the fuzzing test, we noticed that validating performance regressions is challenging because the ground truth of the regression is unclear and may be heavily affected by the
execution environment and lead to a lot of false-positive bugs,” Jung said.
To counter this, the researchers applied validation checks to reduce false positives.
SQLMin
SQLMin minimizes the regression-triggering query, so performance isn’t compromised by trying to determine the essence of a regression-causing statement. The researchers achieve this by using both bottom-up and top-down approaches.
Bottom-up strategy extracts one sub-query from the database and monitors whether there is still a regression problem. If there is one, SQLMin keeps the sub-query for further analysis. The top-down strategy removes as many expressions as possible.
“This takes out as many elements of the statement as possible while ensuring that the reduced query still triggers the problem,” Jung says.
SQLDebug
Once a regression report is filed, developers must diagnose its root cause. To simplify the diagnosis process, the researchers use two techniques to automatically identify the root cause.
First, they use the mathematical approximation method of bisecting to find the historical commit, or first code update, that the developer pushed to the code repository. Second, they leverage statistical debugging to determine if performance decreased because of suspicious source lines within the commit.
The researchers introduced Apollo at the Very Large Data Bases conference from Aug. 31 to Sept. 4. Jung wrote the paper, APOLLO: Automatic Detection and Diagnosis of Performance Regressions in Database Systems, with SCS postdoctoral student Hong Hu, Arulraj, and Associate Professor Taesoo Kim, and eBay’s Woonhak Kang.
Open-Source Hardware Makes Research Accessible
Designing architecture for general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) has been challenging because the hardware is expensive and labor-intensive to produce.
A new open-source tool from Georgia Tech, however, is making research more accessible for everyone.
Vortex is a reconfigurable GPGPU accelerator that uses an extended open-source reduced instruction set computer (RISC), an open architecture. By combining a GPGPU with RISC-V, the hardware can use the open programming framework OpenCL.
“Before RISC-V, building full-stack GPU hardware would have been an insurmountable task that only large companies would have had the resources to do,” said Blaise Tine, a School of Computer Science (SCS) Ph.D. student who leads the Vortex GPU. “One of the main design goals of this project is to support open-source tools across the board; software, compilers, simulators, synthesis, etc., to really make this platform as accessible as possible.”
Hardware roadblocks
Since the number of computer chip transistors is no longer expected to double every year as Moore’s law held up until the past few years, the semiconductor industry has been pushing specialized hardware to make up for performance gaps.
Now heterogeneous systems-on-chip provide powerful performance, but a lot of GPGPU research is restricted to simulation unless researchers can work with large companies on the actual hardware.
“Hardware design is extremely difficult and time-consuming, and before the emergence of RISC-V, there were no standardized ISA or software tools that guaranteed long-term support of open-source contributions like this,” said Tech alumnus Fares Elsabbagh.
Open-source solutions
Yet with the advent of open-source ISAs like RISC-V, and the programming framework OpenCL, the researchers saw an opportunity.
To support OpenCL on Vortex, the researchers used the open-source compiler POCL and extended it to support RISC-V and Vortex ISA. Being able to use OpenCL was a major breakthrough for Vortex because it allowed the processor to execute real applications. This has practical applications, such as running existing machine learning programs without having to rewrite the program.
“Vortex is built on industry-standard open-source tools and protocols, allowing researchers and companies to easily modify the design to their needs, and be able to easily evaluate it against other designs,” Elsabbagh said.
Vortex is already being used in student projects, and the researchers have plans to extend its capabilities. They also plan to expand the platform to cover all aspects of hardware acceleration, graphics, artificial intelligence, vision, and audio.
The researchers presented Vortex in the poster, Vortex: An Open Source Reconfigurable RISC-V GPGPU Accelerator for Architecture Research, at Hot Chips: A Symposium on High Performance Chips from Aug. 16-18. Tine and Elsabaggh wrote the paper with Tech studnets Apurve Chawda, Will Gulian, Yaotian Feng, Da Eun Shim, Priyadarshini Roshan, Ethan Lyons, Lingjun Zhu, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Sung Kyu Lim, and SCS Professor Hyesoon Kim.
Student Startup Bringing a Sense of Real Life to Virtual Meetings
Earlier this year, third-year Georgia Tech computer science (CS) student Piyush Kancharlawar and his teammates were on the verge of crushing it with a 3D scanner that reveals a person’s muscle mass and body fat.
The students – many of them friends since their days at Walton High School in Marietta, Georgia – had launched their company as part of CREATE-X Startup Launch, a Georgia Tech program that has helped launch more than 100 companies founded by students.
“We were doing well, meeting a lot of people in the startup community, and talking with a lot of prospective customers,” says Kancharlawar.
“But then the pandemic hit.“
When Covid-19 became a reality in the US, the team’s prospective customers – primarily gyms and fitness centers – closed across the country in an effort to limit the spread of the disease.
“When that happened, we knew that if we wanted to be successful, we had to move on to another concept,” says Kancharlawar.
Like just about everything else at the time, the team moved its meetings online. They were also attending classes and other events virtually. From here, it didn’t take long for a new direction to emerge.
“As part of the CREATE-X process, teams are encouraged to identify and address existing pain points for customers rather than building something new from scratch,” says Kancharlawar.
“We were experiencing the pain points of virtual meetings firsthand, and we immediately recognized that there was a lot of room for improvement in the space.”
With this notion, Kancharlawar, mechanical engineering student Khyati Shah, industrial engineering student Carl Liu, and University of Pennsylvania student Christopher Cherian co-founded Gatherly, a new virtual meeting platform that the founders say is more familiar, natural, and engaging for online users.
Gatherly is one of nearly 50 primarily student-led teams showcasing their business startups this week at CREATE-X Demo Day.
Welcome to Hotel Gatherly
The Gatherly platform, which has been commercially available since April, uses a novel spatial approach to online meetings. It allows users to move within virtual two-dimensional conference and event spaces. Here, they can move their icon around 2D maps to engage with different tables, sessions, speakers, and other virtual attendees. At the edge of each map is a bank of elevators.
“Real-life conferences don’t take place in just one room. Some events are spread out across fifty rooms or several floors,” says Amaan Pirani, Gatherly co-founder and Columbia University CS student. “That’s why we think of Gatherly as a hotel.”
Within this hotel, which is customized to meet each client's particular needs, virtual attendees are first directed to a PDF for a listing of what’s located on each floor. Attendees then use the elevators to move between floors.
For a virtual career fair, the floors might be for different industries and business sectors. For an academic fair – like the one Gatherly hosted recently for 2,000 first-year students at Rice University – they could be for different colleges and disciplines.
To achieve something similar to this on other platforms, event organizers end up having to create potentially dozens of unique event URLs. The URLs are shared in a spreadsheet with attendees, who must then navigate the list to listen to different speakers, meet with different company representatives, or attend different workshops.
“The beauty of Gatherly is that we can work for groups as small as 5 to 10, but I also just spoke with a group that has 9,000 people that wants to use the platform. So what’s really interesting is how we scale up using the 'floors' concept,” says Pirani.
Escaping the Fishbowl
The team’s approach allows event planners to move beyond a one-to-many communications model to plan more engaging, fulfilling, and successful meetings using a many-to-many model. It’s this feature that Gatherly customers seem to be responding to most, according to Cherian, Gatherly chief financial officer.
“Being unable to actually interact with people means most online meetings fall flat, and there ends up being this weird fishbowl effect that’s really uncomfortable when, say, for instance, everyone watches as one person says goodbye to another during a large meeting,” says Cherian.
Gatherly’s many-to-many approach to virtual meetings addresses this issue by allowing one user to connect with another simply by dragging a line between their respective icons. Once together, the two are instantly in their own “face-to-face” meeting. Others can join if they like, or the impromptu meeting can be locked for privacy.
“We spend a lot of time talking with our clients about their needs and pain points. We also study how people interact with and move around within the virtual space in order to optimize the user experience,” says Lulu Gao, Gatherly user experience designer and Georgia Tech industrial and product design student.
Hosting Demo Day
Along with pushing its user experience forward, the team is “focused on internal metrics, bumping up revenue, raising our net promoter score, and generally trying to make our product as great as possible,” said Cherian.
The team, which also includes Georgia Tech CS student and co-founder Sohan Choudhury, is particularly focused on these metrics this week. Like the other participating startups, they are being judged, in part, on their metrics during Thursday’s CREATE-X Demo Day showcase.
Unlike the other teams though, Gatherly has a bit of added pressure; not only are they participating in Demo Day, Gatherly is also hosting the high-profile virtual event on its platform.
“We hosted a poster session for CREATE-X in July that went well, so the organizers are confident that the platform will perform well for this event. We’re honored and pleased to be able to do this for the program,” says Kancharlawar.
“The CREATE-X provides an invaluable opportunity to learn from so many people with shared experiences. It’s a tremendous way for students to connect with the startup community of mentors and investors.”
Adding a Vegetarian Option
After Demo Day, the Gatherly team says it will continue work to make its platform – built with Amazon Web Services – more reliable. They are also planning a self-service model. The goal is to give clients the freedom to build out their events, add logos, and customize event spaces and maps without having to work directly with a Gatherly representative.
“We know we can’t be good at everything. The event space is gigantic, happy hours are so different from conferences, and we really think that these differences matter,” says Pirani. “So over time, we’ll likely focus more on supporting a few types rather than trying to be all things to all clients.”
Although the company was founded to meet the immediate challenges of the pandemic, the Gatherly team sees a bright future for its platform in a post-Covid market.
“One of our clients put it best. ‘If you run events after the pandemic and you don’t have some kind of online offering, that’s sort of like running a diner that has no vegetarian options;’ it’s just a ridiculous concept at this point,” says Cherian.
“There are tons of benefits from meeting in person, but having an online option gives a huge bump up in accessibility, and will allow organizations to attract more people from remote communities.”
IC Student Ceara Byrne Trades Dog Toys for Masks to Chip in on Covid Relief
What do dog toys have to do with Covid-19 pandemic relief? Leave it to a Georgia Tech student to find a connection.
School of Interactive Computing Ph.D. student Ceara Byrne, whose primary research focuses on instrumenting dog toys with various sensors to measure canine behavior, found a way to contribute to the cause when she was approached by a fellow Georgia Tech student for assistance in 3D printing.
Lee Whitcher, a Ph.D. student in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering, had already joined colleagues from the Georgia Tech Research Institute and George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering to design and manufacture personal protective equipment (PPE) like face shields to supplement the available supplies in the Atlanta area.
The work from GTRI and ME assisted in hospitals, and Whitcher’s work – a non-profit called Atlanta Beats COVID – aimed to design and produce masks and ventilators that could be produced by non-engineers wherever they are needed.
To do that, Whitcher and his partners needed a 3D printer that could cast the negatives for the masks. Georgia Tech’s GVU Prototyping Lab in the Technology Square Research Building had just what they needed. So did Byrne.
Byrne has been using the Prototyping Lab’s printer for a while now to develop negatives of the silicone dog toys she uses in her research. Byrne’s work involves studying behavior in canines to understand temperament for service animals.
“I was inspired by a friend from high school who grew up on a ranch,” Byrne said. “She and I got involved in 4-H. When I came back for a master’s degree, I started working with Thad Starner and Melody Jackson on the FIDO project. I started noticing these aspects of the data that were reflective of dog temperament like drive and how they tackle activities. It really interested me.”
Part of the research was to find good ways to measure that temperament beyond just visual observation. One solution was to place sensors into toys to take measurements as the dog played with it.
“I’ve used the Prototyping Lab to 3D print my negative molds so that I can silicone cast the positives like balls and tug toys,” Byrne said. “It’s a long process of finding the right silicones, materials, hardness. For the toys, I went through three or four different molds to find the right way to actually cast the parts. It was a lot of experimenting.”
That experimentation made her uniquely prepared to chip in with Whitcher’s project when Covid-19 hit. Looking for a way to develop the right mold for easy do-it-yourself mask production, Whitcher turned to Byrne for assistance.
“There are a number of aspects to it,” Byrne said. “How do you de-gas some of the silicone? When you have a mask, you can’t have the bubbles in the mold because you need a seal. How do you do it with the vacuum? If there’s no vacuum available, what are some easier ways? How do we make these negatives properly, and how many can you cast at once? What are the environmental aspects when you do it from home?”
These are all questions Byrne has had to explore when it comes to her dog toys. The experience proved useful in the mask production, as well.
Byrne was happy to get involved in pandemic relief assistance. She has brothers and sisters-in-law who are doctors.
“They’ve been amazing in helping around the community,” she said. “My brother is making masks, which I think is fascinating. He’s a radiation oncologist and has built respiratory masks with the Pancreatic Cancer Foundation. So, I wanted to help out in any way that I could, as well.”
Being at Georgia Tech, she said, made the collaboration a natural occurrence.
“That’s what makes Georgia Tech unique, right?” she said. “We can collaborate across these disciplines that maybe don’t connect to each other on the surface.”

Along with cybersecurity and software engineering, Georgia Tech also ranked well in artificial intelligence (No. 9), computer systems (No. 8), data analysis/science (No. 8), and theory (No. 10).
Other Georgia Tech schools also fared well in the new U.S. News undergraduate rankings.
This is the first year that undergraduate CS is included in rankings. According to U.S. News, adding CS to its undergraduate ranking highlights one of the most rapidly growing and important majors in higher education today. U.S. News evaluated 481 undergraduate CS programs. The outlet says deans and senior faculty from peer schools and departments determine its rankings.
Georgia Tech Part of $5 Million Grant to Develop AI Tech Supporting Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Workplace
The National Science Foundation has awarded a $5 million grant to a multi-university team of researchers that includes Georgia Tech to create novel artificial intelligence technology that trains and supports individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the workplace.
The investment follows a successful $1 million, nine-month pilot grant to the same team, which also includes Yale University, Cornell University, Vanderbilt University, and the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Georgia Tech’s portion of the grant is $500,000.
Led by co-principal investigator Professor Jim Rehg of the School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Tech will develop methods for assessing nonverbal communication behaviors during face-to-face social interactions such as job interviews.
“Our innovative approach uses an unobtrusive wearable camera to record social behaviors, which are then analyzed using computer vision and deep learning models,” Rehg said. “Our automated analysis will allow job seekers to get feedback on their communication skills as part of our team’s integrated approach to job interview coaching.”
The project, which is part of the NSF’s Convergence Accelerator program, addresses an underutilized U.S. talent pool that poses a “critical but overlooked public health and economic challenge: how to include individuals with ASD” in the workforce, according to Vanderbilt Professor Nilanjan Sarkar who is leading the project team.
Consider:
- One in 54 people in the United States has ASD;
- Each year 70,000 young adults with ASD leave high school and face grim employment prospects;
- More than 8 in 10 adults with ASD are either unemployed or underemployed, a significantly higher rate than adults with other developmental disabilities;
- The estimated lifetime cost of supporting an individual with ASD and limited employment prospects $3.2 million.
- The total estimated cost of caring for Americans with ASD was $268 billion in 2015 and projected to grow to $461 billion in 2025.
- An estimated $50,000 per person per year could be contributed back into society when individuals with ASD are employed.
“We want to harness the power of AI, stakeholder engagement and convergent research to include neurodiverse individuals in the 21st century workforce,” Sarkar said. “We feel that there is a big opportunity to turn great societal cost into great societal value.”
For this project, organizational, clinical and implementation experts are integrated with engineering teams to pave the way for real-world impact. The multi-university, multi-disciplinary team already has commitments from major employers to license some of the technology and tools developed.
Researchers will address three themes:
- Individualized assessment of unique abilities and appropriate job-matching
- Tailored understanding and ongoing support related to social communication and interaction challenge
- Tools to support job candidates, employees and employers.
Already, notable private-sector companies that employ people with ASD have committed to using at least one of the technologies developed under this program: Auticon, The Precisionists, Ernst & Young and SAP among them.
Two other companies, Floreo and Tipping Point Media, will make their existing VR modules available for adaptation to the program. Microsoft, which has a long-standing interest in hiring people with ASD, is involved as well and provided seed funding and access to cloud services for technology integration.
The five technologies can be used separately or as an integrated system, and the work has broader potential beyond ASD to expand employment access. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 50 million people have ASD, attention-deficit/ hyper-activity disorder, learning disability or other neuro-diverse conditions.
Georgia Tech Receives Google Grant to Study Impact of Pandemic Information Seeking on Vulnerable Populations
Georgia Tech will receive $155,000 from Google’s Covid-19 AI for Social Good program to investigate patterns and impact of pandemic information-seeking amongst vulnerable populations, such as older adults, low-income households, and Black and Hispanic adults. These populations have experienced disproportionately high rates of Covid-19-related death, severe sickness, and life disruptions like job loss.
Factors like higher rates of underlying health problems, reduced access to health care, and structural inequities shape access to critical resources. These same populations, however, also often have less access to the types of online information designed to improve health outcomes.
This project, led by principal investigator Andrea Grimes Parker, an associate professor in the School of Interactive Computing and member of the Institute for People and Technology, will investigate how vulnerable and marginalized populations use technology for information seeking during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the impact of information exposure on their psychological wellbeing over time.
“The Covid-19 pandemic has brought further attention to systemic disparities in health that have long existed in the United States,” Parker said. “Within a public health crisis, the information that people are exposed to has huge implications for how attitudes around the pandemic are shaped, how people respond, and thus the course of the pandemic.
“Our work will provide both qualitative and quantitative evidence of the particular ways in which Covid-19 information exposure is tied to outcomes such as mental health in those most vulnerable to Covid-19 mortality and morbidity.”
Researchers will examine this information exposure over time. Their findings will help to shape recommendations for crisis information communication, particularly online, in the future. This work builds upon existing work by Parker and collaborators at Northeastern University.
Parker and colleagues Professors Miso Kim and Dr. Jacqueline Griffin began their collaboration investigation how well crisis apps – mobile apps designed to provide help during emergency situations – support older adults. This work was published at the 2020 ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.
When the pandemic began, they expanded their focus to additional groups of vulnerable to poor health, such as low-income and racial and ethnic minority populations. The team, in collaboration with Professor Stacy Marsella, also expanded their focus beyond crisis apps, designing a survey to investigate information seeking practices in vulnerable populations amidst the pandemic.
This survey has been distributed to over 600 individuals in Massachusetts and Georgia to date. Parker’s new Google funding will enable the team to iterate on and expand the dissemination of this survey, conduct longitudinal analyses, and compliment the quantitative analysis with a qualitative component that will help unpack the nuances behind information-seeking practices and resulting Covid-19 attitudes, behaviors, and mental health outcomes.
This funding is part of Google.org’s $100 million commitment to Covid-19 relief efforts. Organizations receiving funds were selected through a competitive review. Funding focus areas include health equity, disease spread monitoring and forecasting, frontline health worker support, secondary public health effects, and privacy-preserving contact tracing efforts.
Finally, A Site that Crops Headshots Instantly (Without Sharing Your Photos)
From social media to professional directories, the number of photos to edit – and the time you spend editing them – can feel endless. Now, rather than downloading yet another app that uses your data, you can use Magic Crop to get a perfectly cropped headshot.
Magic Crop is a web page that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence and photography’s rule of thirds to seamlessly and easily crop your photos into the perfect headshot. All the while, without sharing or storing your photos.
College of Computing first-year student Megan Dass, alongside School of Computational Science and Engineering Associate Professor Polo Chau, created the web-based cropping tool in one week.
“Every year, many new members join my research group and teaching team. We have to individually crop their photos so they have a uniform look and it is a lot of work,” Chau told Dass in their original correspondence about the project.
According to Dass, an avid social media user, there was an instant connection to the project.
“I related right then and there because even when I have to crop something small like a headshot for social media, cropping is the worst part. I knew from my experience alone that this could help a lot of people if they could just drag a number of images onto a simple web page and instantly have perfectly cropped photos,” she said.
Magic Crop uses a deep neural network to detect where a human face is on an photo. What’s more, the neural network is compact enough that Magic Crop can download it to the user’s device. The users’ photos never need to leave their devices, so there is no privacy concern with the page.
“Our group cares a lot about building tools that are as easy to use as possible. So, we were looking for a way of deploying this new technology that everyone, no matter their skill level, could use and have satisfactory results,” said Chau.
Of course, as with any editing software, there are boundaries for the existing site’s intuitive nature. The site is unable to determine which face needs to be cropped if a user uploads a photo with multiple people in it, and pixilation can happen to any photo if it is taken from too far away.
“It’s a problem that we all face, and this is just a simple solution that can fix it easily,” said Dass.
Chau hopes the project will be expanded in the future after gathering feedback on how best to develop the user experience.
“It’s an iterative process. Currently, it is quite automated, but we might support extending to more sophisticated options on the site such as ratios,” he said.
Virtual Assistant Stops Robocalls
Americans receive 4.8 million robocalls a year, but what if they didn’t have to be interrupted by them? Georgia Tech researchers developed a virtual assistant that screens calls to block 97 percent of scammers.
Currently, people rely on blacklist apps to stop spam calls, but they are only up to 60 percent effective, according to School of Computer Science Ph.D. student Sharbani Pandit. This is because of the prominence of neighbor spoofing, or numbers similar to person’s own.
“The caller number will look very similar to your own number, so you’re more likely to pick up, and each time they call, they use a new number, so it doesn’t show on the blacklist,” said Pandit.
So Pandit and her team tried a more direct approach, a virtual assistant (VA). Like a smart home device or a secretary, the VA determines whether calls are from people before it passes the call off to the user.
How It Works
Whether a call is spam or not can be determined by a simple question: does the caller know the name of the person they’re calling?
“The idea is someone who is a wanted caller would know the full name of the person they’re trying to reach,” Pandit said.
If the caller can confirm the name, the VA would forward the call and a transcript of how the conversation went to the user. The entire interaction takes 10 seconds.
For callers who may not know the name but are not a bot, VA engages in a conversation and interrupts the caller as they are speaking to determine if the caller stops talking. This process takes a maximum of 30 seconds.
“It’s very natural in human conversation that you would stop to listen to what the other party is saying on the call, but a bot wouldn’t do that,” Pandit said.
For calls thought to be spam, the notification would be sent to the user with a label for each caller to indicate whether it was a human or a robot caller.
How Many Calls It Stops
The researchers did a user study with 21 people who determined they were comfortable talking to the VA. They also tested the VA on a database 8,000 robocall recordings, in which 97.8 percent of the robocalls were correctly labeled as such.
Pandit presented the research in Fighting Voice Spam with a Virtual Assistant Prototype. She co-wrote the paper with University of Georgia’s Jienan Liu and Associate Professor Roberto Perdisci, and SCS Professor Mustaque Ahamad. The work has already garnered media attention from New Scientist and Digital Trends.
The researchers are still making a few adjustments before they release the Android app. Robocalls are constantly evolving and getting more sophisticated, which introduces new challenges to researchers. Some robocalls even have lists of phone numbers and names, so the researchers are adding more questions in the screening conversation that only a human could answer.
They believe that anything that can slow down the efficacy of robocalls will be a benefit.
“The goal of robocalls is to make as many calls as possible to target victims and make a profit from it, but as security researchers, if we can add hurdles in their step, then sometimes the cost isn’t worth it for the attacker,” said Pandit.
Record Number of Students Attend Largest Women in Tech Conference
The College of Computing is sending more than 100 students to the Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) from Sept. 29 to Oct. 3. Many are attending the annual conference for the first time.
Although the event is taking place virtually this year, it’s still one of largest gatherings of women in computing with more than 30,000 people from 115 countries representing academia and industry.
Thanks to scholarships from the College, 63 undergraduate students, 32 master’s students, six Online Master’s of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) students, and 12 Ph.D. students are able to attend.
They have the opportunity to watch more than 200 panels and keynotes. Some highlights from Georgia Tech include a fireside chat with Joy Buolamwini, an alumna and founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, on Decoding Bias on Oct. 3.
The Constellations Center for Equity in Computing’s Director of Educational Innovation and Leadership Lien Diaz joins the panel Seeing Beyond Yourself: Effective Allyship, Advocacy, and Activism for Women in Computing on Sept. 29.
“I am particularly interested in the wide array of topics that GHC speakers will be addressing from tech careers to applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence,” said OMSCS student Michelle Adea.
The conference is just as much about networking as learning. As a silver-level sponsor, the College will connect with prospective students.
Some students are excited to meet other women in computing.
“I’m looking forward to engaging with other like-minded women in different career positions and levels of education and making connections,” said undergraduate Rashmi Athavale.
Google Awards Computing Student for Outstanding Machine Learning Research
School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Ph.D. student Xinshi Chen is being recognized for her work in machine learning with a prestigious fellowship.
Chen specializes in principled machine learning research with a focus on learning-based algorithm design and deep learning structured data. Her work has garnered the attention of Google and recently received the 2020 Google Ph.D. Fellowship for outstanding graduate research in machine learning.
One of her recent co-authored papers aims to create a system that can automatically learn an algorithm from data and apply the learned algorithm to solve new problems. The paper, developed with CSE Associate Professor Le Song, along with Yufei Zhang and Christoph Reisinger of the University of Oxford, will be presented at the Thirty-fourth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, which is scheduled for Dec. 6 through 12.
Chen said, “Both algorithms and deep learning models aim to solve problems and make predictions for various tasks. Our project investigates the connection between traditional algorithms and deep learning models, and the strengths of these two can be combined to help each other.”
According to Chen, the design of algorithms can be automated and improved upon by learning from data with data-driven components filling the gaps between the rules designed by experts and the real-world observations.
“On the other hand, deep learning models can use algorithm structures as inductive bias for designing the architectures, which can improve the data efficiency and interpretability of deep learning models,” she said.
“By viewing learning-based algorithms as deep learning models, currently we are designing a theoretical framework to understand their behaviors from the learning theory perspective, by characterizing their generalization, representation abilities, and more,” said Chen.
When asked why she chose to study with the School of CSE despite her machine learning emphasis, Chen said it was due to its interdisciplinary approach to modern science.
“There is a broad range of research topics that CSE faculty are working on, and many of these research topics are closely related to our daily life, including high-performance computing, healthcare, and computational biology. It is very useful to attend the seminars organized by CSE and interact with people with different backgrounds as it can bring in new ideas from communities outside machine learning,” she said.
Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts and the College of Computing Launch New Ethics Center
Building on years of experience in research and education in ethics and technology, the College of Computing and the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts have launched the Ethics, Technology, and Human Interaction Center (ETHICx).
The new Center — pronounced “ethics” — will advance ethics-in-technology-centered research, education, and engagement at the Georgia Institute of Technology in collaboration with communities, government, non-governmental organizations, and industry. The office of the Executive Vice President for Research provided significant funds over a three-year period to seed the Center.
“We must foster Georgia Tech’s strengths in ethics, responsible research, and the development of emerging technologies in collaborative ways,” said Raheem Beyah, Georgia Tech’s vice president for interdisciplinary research. “ETHICx will provide the necessary environment to support this work and Georgia Tech’s mission to advance technology and improve the human condition.”
The Colleges already have in-depth research and education experience addressing technology-related ethics questions. For instance, the School of Public Policy founded the Center for Ethics and Technology more than 12 years ago to foster a critical inquiry culture and deliberation about technology-related ethical issues. Faculty in that Center research ethical issues in the design of emerging contact tracing technologies, design ethics, social justice theory, and criticism broadly, and their relationship to emerging technologies such as smart cities, self-driving cars, and smart assistants, and a platform for fostering reflection and self-correcting reasoning in teaching and deliberation. The College of Computing also has created thriving research and educational initiatives such as the Ethical AI professional development course and the Law, Policy, and Ethics Initiative for Machine Learning @ GATECH.
The new Center will build on those strengths and position the Georgia Institute of Technology to become the leader in framing ethical concerns in technology, including fairness, accountability, transparency, social justice, and technological change.
Anticipating New Ethical Challenges
“ETHICx will be a place for robust, multidisciplinary research and a place to engage in systematic ethical analyses,” said Kaye Husbands Fealing, dean of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts and co-director of the new Center. “It also will be a place for communities, corporations, governments, technologists, educators, and others to discuss and find solutions to complex ethical issues in science and technology.”
The Center will conduct research in ethics and emerging technologies, frame ethical questions, solutions in ethics and technology, and social justice and equity. Interdisciplinary and community-based research also will be emphasized.
Educational initiatives will include investigating and designing curricula for ethics training that can be woven throughout students’ educational journeys and for employees at affiliated companies.
”Responsibility is a core value of everything we do in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech. That means focusing on our communities and examining the impacts, both positive and negative, of our research and curricula,” said Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay, Jr. chair of the College of Computing. “It means reaching across disciplines to collaborate with experts in other fields who can inform our own technological developments. We find solutions for tomorrow’s problems, which means we have to anticipate the new ethical challenges we will face. This Center will help us do that.”
New Center Builds on Deep Experience
Ayanna Howard, chair in the School of Interactive Computing, joins Husbands Fealing as co-director of the new Center.
“In the School of Interactive Computing, we encourage all of our faculty and student researchers to think critically about the new challenges their research presents and offer strategies to mitigate any potential negative impact on society,” Howard said. “Good innovation isn’t just about developing new technologies; it’s about developing solutions to problems that can make the world a better, more equitable, and more inclusive place.”
Georgia Tech launched the School of Interactive Computing in anticipation of the need for interdisciplinary research in computer science, liberal arts, and more. Faculty members examine diverse ethical challenges, including misinformation, content moderation, free speech on social platforms, data privacy and security, virtual reality, wearable computing devices, and robo-ethics.
Faculty and students throughout the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts engage in interdisciplinary research collaborations on ethics and emerging technologies, including in areas such as engineering, the environment, bioethics, responsible innovation, research ethics, the ethical and political dimensions of design and technology, and more.
“In the Ivan Allen College, careful consideration of the impacts of technology on people, and of people on technology, is a central part of our curriculum and values,” said Justin Biddle, an associate professor in the School of Public Policy, director of the Center for Ethics and Technology, and a member of the new Center’s leadership team. “With innovation today often outpacing our ability to understand its consequences, and widespread questions regarding the relations between technology, equity, and social justice, this kind of thinking is more important than ever.”
Faculty in both Colleges also have initiated discussions on the social and ethical implications of emerging technologies across campus and beyond. These include the TechDebates on Emerging Technologies, the Sparks Forum on Ethics and Engineering, the Machine Learning@GT Seminar Series, and the Ethics and Technological Futures series developed by Nassim Parvin and Susana Morris in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication. Ellen Zegura, a professor in the School of Computer Science, also leads a Mozilla grant aimed at embedding ethics in computer science classes through role play.
'Where the Best of Sciences and Humanities Meet'
Deven Desai, associate professor and area coordinator for Law and Ethics at Scheller College of Business, also will assume a key leadership role at ETHICx. He said the new Center will “build and deepen technology-related ethics scholarship and research across Georgia Tech.
“Scheller College’s focus on law and ethics is part of how we train future business leaders, the people who take innovation and bring it to market,” said Desai, who is also associate director for Law, Policy, and Ethics for Machine Learning at GA Tech (ML@GATECH), an interdisciplinary research center.
“ETHICx will be a place where the best of science and humanities meet to challenge and push to find the unasked, important questions. In that friction and fun, the best questions about the problems we face and the best answer about how to solve them so that everyone can benefit will come out,” he said.
Other members of the new Center’s key leadership team include Jason Borenstein, director of graduate research ethics programs in the School of Public Policy; Betsy DiSalvo, director of the human-centered computing Ph.D. program and associate professor in the School of Interactive Computing; Michael Hoffmann, a professor in the School of Public Policy; and Nassim Parvin, an associate professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication.
A launch event is planned for November, during Ethics Awareness Week, with a forum to identify key challenges in technology ethics. The Center will soon announce details.
New CRNCH Co-Director Tackles Post-Moore Computing with HPC in Mind
“Everything in hardware might change, so what does that mean for everything on top?” asked School of Computational Science and Engineering Professor Rich Vuduc.
Vuduc is the newly appointed co-director of the Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH), a unit built on the mission of reexamining and building computing technologies for the post-Moore computing era. He is succeeding Vivek Sarkar – recently named as School of Computer Science chair – and will direct the center alongside School of Computer Science and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Tom Conte.
"CRNCH was conceived as a center for post-Moore computing that spans the entire computing stack, including hardware, software, and algorithms. Rich's expertise in high-performance computing (HPC) algorithms and performance engineering will further contribute to CRNCH's success in this broad vision,” said Sarkar.
Post-Moore Computing’s Challenges
“In HPC especially, we are in a crazy time right now. Basically, for the last 50 years, we got a free ride. Computers got faster every year, and this transformed entire industries,” said Vuduc.
The improvements Vuduc is referring to, came about from the ability to make transistors smaller each year, allowing for faster computing year-over-year. The problem computing is facing now is that the scientific community does not know how to make transistors any smaller, and there is no defined way to move forward.
[RELATED: Sarker Named as School of Computer Science Chair]
According to Vuduc, “It’s an incredibly fertile time to be exploring all kinds of wacky, very radical new ways of thinking about computing systems and how we might build them. And CRNCH has been investigating these questions since it was launched in 2016.”
Bringing a Fresh Perspective to the Center
From the way algorithms are designed to the way machines are programmed, software is still being built around the 1970s concept of a general-purpose computer.
“A lot of people are working to figure out what the physical and logical form of the computer is going to look like in the future. But a related question is, ‘What is the thing that is going to run on top?’” said Vuduc.
“In my joining CRNCH, I hope to think a lot more about those kinds of issues. That’s why I think this new role is exciting.”
Building a CRNCH Community
In his new role, Vuduc wants to launch projects with the goal of developing algorithms and applications to run on these hypothetical future systems. However, his long-term goals are considerably more community focused.
Currently, he is hoping to excite a critical mass of people at Georgia Tech to begin thinking about the types of problems associated with post-Moore computing.
“From my point of view, the most exciting thing would be if we can bring new people on board, whether it be new faculty or students, to really think about these upper levels in the ‘computing stack.’ What are the kinds of applications and algorithms that we might run on these future machines?” he said.
Pioneering Program Analysis Paper Honored
School of Computer Science Professor Alessandro Orso and his former student William Halfond won the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2020 Most Influential Paper award for their innovative program analysis work.
The award honors research that had the most impact out of the papers published that year. Orso and Halfond, who is now an associate professor at the University of Southern California, won for their paper, AMNESIA: Analysis and Monitoring for NEutralizing SQL-injection Attacks.
Amnesia is a fully automated technique for detecting and preventing one of the most catastrophic types of web application attacks.
The research
SQL injection attacks (SQLIAs) inject malicious code into databases to expose information. This can lead to private information being leaked or even entire databases being corrupted. SQLIAs are one of the most prominent attack types, and at the time of this research, were considered the number-one threat for web applications.
Before Orso and Halfond introduced Amnesia, developers had to manually incorporate specific checks into their applications. This process was both time-consuming and prone to error.
Amnesia was the first fully automated techniques for detecting and preventing SQLIAs that was widely applicable and successful.
“Our approach was based on the intuition that developers implicitly provide, in the web application code, a policy on what kind of database requests are allowed,” Orso said.
With this in mind, Amnesia’s approach did three things:
- Extracted a policy from the code using static analysis
- Checked database requests against this policy
- Stopped requests that violated the policy, as they were likely SQLIAs
The impact
The paper made ripples in the program analysis community.
“Our paper was one of the first papers that successfully applied program analysis techniques to the problem of SQLIAs,” Orso said.
As a result, other research groups built on that work and its underlying idea. To date, the original paper has been cited over 700 times.
It also jump-started Orso’s career. The concept became the basis for a project sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, Preventing SQL Code Injection by Combining Static and Runtime Analysis, in collaboration with Professor Wenke Lee.
Orso and Halfond continued to advance the SQLIAs detection and prevention area in both their careers. The work also motivated Orso’s research group to develop general testing and analysis techniques for web applications — work that ultimately became Halfond’s Ph.D. dissertation.
“Receiving this prestigious award from the research community for a paper already so close to my heart is a humbling, exciting, and incredibly rewarding experience that goes beyond my wildest expectations,” Orso said.
Georgia Tech Researchers Contribute 13 Papers to Premier Visualization Conference
Georgia Tech contributed to 13 papers and two workshops this week at IEEE VIS 2020, the premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics.
The conference highlights research from universities, government, and industry around the world. It is comprised of three separate events: IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST), IEEE Information Visualization (InfoVis), and IEEE Scientific Visualization (SciVis). Like other conferences throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, VIS was held virtually.
Georgia Tech’s research was highlighted by one VAST Best Poster Research Award Honorable Mention titled Mapping Researchers with PeopleMap. The paper – authored by Jon Saad-Falcon, Omar Shaikh, Zijie J. Wang, Austin P. Wright, Sasha Richardson, and Polo Chau – presents an open-source interactive tool that uses natural language processing to create visual maps for researchers based on their research interests and publications.
“Discovering research expertise at universities can be a difficult task,” the paper contends. “Directories routinely become outdated, and few help in visually summarizing researchers’ work or supporting the exploration of shared interests among researchers. This results in lost opportunities for both internal and external entities to discover new connections, nurture research collaboration, and explore the diversity of research.”
Also of note, new School of Computational Science & Engineering Chair Haesun Park received recognition for a 2010 IEEE VAST Paper. The paper received a Test of Time Award, recognizing it for continued contributions to the visual analytics and visualization community. The paper is titled iVisClassifier: An Interactive Visual Analytics System for Classification Based on Supervised Dimension Reduction and co-authored by Jaegul Choo, Hanseung Lee, and Jaeyeon Kihm.
School of Interactive Computing Ph.D. student Emily Wall, who is advised by Associate Professor Alex Endert, was also recognized with the VGTC Outstanding Dissertation Honorable Mention for her work Detecting and Mitigating Human Bias in Visual Analytics.
“People are susceptible to a multitude of biases, including perceptual biases and illusions; cognitive biases like confirmation bias or anchoring bias; and social biases like racial or gender bias that are borne of cultural experiences and stereotypes,” Wall contends. “As humans are an integral part of data analysis and decision making in many domains, their biases can be injected into and even amplified by models and algorithms.”
Her work aims to develop a better understanding of the role human bias plays in visual data analysis by defining bias, detecting bias, and mitigating bias.

Why is This New Deep Learning Visualization Going Viral?
Interactive visualizations are quickly becoming a favorite tool to help teach and learn deep learning subjects. One visualization in particular is rising to the top of GitHub, Twitter, and LinkedIn as a standout resource to understand convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Created by Georgia Tech and Oregon State University researchers over the course of a year, CNN Explainer is a robust interactive visualization tool uniquely developed for deep learning beginners.
By combining visualizations, animation, and transitions, CNN Explainer enables users to inspect the interplay between low-level mathematical operations and high-level model structures. Presenting views with different level of details gives users control over what technique they focus on and allows them to transition to others when they are ready.
“While there are other existing tools that help explain CNNs for beginners, this tool is quite different in how comprehensive its depth is and how it combines everything together,” said Zijie Jay Wang, the primary investigator of this work.
“Some tools only explain high level structures while others only focus on low level mathematical instruction. We wanted to build a tool that could integrate everything together and use transitions to help users navigate through different structures and their levels of detail,” he said.
While CNN Explainer was originally created with students and deep learning instructors in mind, general professionals and avid deep learning professionals are also showing excitement and interest in this new tool.
“Many professionals who want to find out more about deep learning, and machine learning are accessing and using CNN Explainer, and it is helping them get started in this field. Meanwhile, avid deep learning practitioners have been adapting CNN Explainer to debug their own models,” said Wang.
The traction CNN Explainer has gained across web communities is another undeniable testament to its usability and need. Since its public release on May 1st, it has received almost 5000 GitHub stars and an average of 300 daily visitors from more than 80 countries.
“The success of CNN Explainer has really shown me how the power of visualization can help people interact with their machine learning models,” continued Wang. “It is a very good interface for both beginners and experts, and in the future, I will try to design more tools for all levels to help them interpret, debug, and understand their models.”
Currently, CNN Explainer has also become a popular tool in deep learning courses—used by instructors from Georgia Tech, University of Wisconsin–Madison, University of Tokyo, and more.
School of Interactive Computing Associate Professor and Facebook AI Research Scientist Dhruv Batra is an early adopter of this tool and currently uses the tool in his Intro to Perception and Robotics course at Georgia Tech.
According to Batra, “I have used CNN Explainer and other visualization tools created by the Polo Club of Data Science in my class. I find such visualizations to be highly valuable in explaining ostensibly complicated concepts in a simple visual way.”
“I am visual learner myself; if I can picture things like the flow of spatial feature maps in a CNN, I can understand the concepts easily. And plenty of research in pedagogy suggests that I am not atypical. In CS 4803/7643 Deep Learning, I augment formal mathematical description with such visualizations, and I am highly appreciative of tools like the CNN Explainer,” said Batra.
The paper outlining CNN Explainer’s process and programming will be presented at the top visualization conference, IEEE VIS 2020. It is also among the selected VIS papers published at IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, the top visualization journal.
Device Uses Latest Smartphone Technology to Make Social Distancing Easier
Social distancing is currently one of the best ways to prevent Covid-19, but maintaining six feet can be challenging. Georgia Tech researchers have created a custom wearable device that helps users stay safely apart in public places.
The device, called 6Fit-A-Part, performs wireless localization using ultra-wideband radios to determine if two or more devices are in close proximity. Within seconds of contact, the device emits a red light and a beep to alert the wearer. It can be worn by users or placed on objects in hospitals, schools, grocery stores, warehouses, and similar locations.
Pairing Wireless Networking and Sensing
6Fit-A-Part uses ultra-wideband radios, a relatively new technology gaining popularity in the latest smartphones. Radio waves are ideal for estimating distances because they travel at a fixed speed that can be measured. To determine which device the radio waves sensed the researchers rely on distributed ranging protocol, a wireless networking concept that extends the reach of a signal.
“We have previously explored various ways to measure distance between two wireless devices by exchanging special ranging packets,” said School of Computer Science (SCS) assistant professor Ashutosh Dhekne. “We identified that similar distance measurements can help us raise an alarm if two or more devices come in close proximity to each other.”
In operation, 6Fit-A-Part invites all neighboring devices to exchange wireless ranging packets to determine distance. Messages are limited, so each round of distance measurements isn’t time-consuming. For example, 10 nearby devices can calculate all-to-all distances within a second. The distance is accurate within 10 centimeters if there are no human or building obstructions.
The device’s merging of wireless networking techniques and wireless sensing technology also makes it more precise than other comparable devices. Instead of alerting a user any time devices are in range, 6Fit-A-Part can distinguish if there is a physical barrier between devices, such as a wall, that would prevent close contact.
It can also observe the received signal and its echoes from nearby objects to determine if there was a human blocking the signals. It can then compensate for the distance accordingly. This prevents false negatives when two people are too close to each other, but their bodies obstruct the signals from their devices.
Contact Prevention Better than Contact Tracing
Although many organizations are using contact tracing applications, the focus on social distancing makes 6Fit-A-Part a preventative measure before users are exposed to the virus. Users also don’t need a specific app downloaded or Bluetooth enabled to receive the benefits.
It protects privacy better, according to researchers.
“6Fit-A-Part reminds everyone to maintain physical distancing, which reduces the possibility of infection without constantly tracking a person’s whereabouts,” said SCS Ph.D. student Yifeng Cao. “This allows complete protection of the user’s privacy by not associating a particular person with the device.”
The researchers hope to test 6Fit-A-Part in additional real-world environments to understand how the device influences human behavior. Dhekne and Cao wrote the paper, 6Fit-A-Part: A Protocol for Physical Distancing on a Custom Wearable Device, with SCS Professor Mostafa Ammar. They presented the research at the 28th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols in October.
High-Performance Computing for All, Everywhere
View the GT@SC20 website here
As big data dominates our markets, the need to assemble and analyze data efficiently has driven high-Performance Computing (HPC) out of research silos and into many public and private enterprises.
The Supercomputing Conference (SC), held from Nov. 9 to 19, is the premier event for this rapidly growing field. Mathematicians, engineers, and developers come together to present the most groundbreaking HPC research, and each year, the Georgia Tech name is one of the leading names in those presentations.
Although it is being hosted virtually, this year is no different for SC20 presentations. With several papers, awards, and workshops, Georgia Tech, represented by the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), Partnership for Advanced Computing Environment (PACE), School of Computer Science (SCS), and the Georgia Tech Research Institute, is leading the charge in the HPC discussion.
This year, Georgia Tech’s SC20 proceedings include three notable awards.
SCS Chair Vivek Sarkar is being recognized with the ACM-IEEE CS Ken Kennedy Award, Nov. 16. Sarkar’s recognition honors his leadership in several areas including foundational technical contributions to programmability and productivity. CSE alumnus Patrick Flick is being honored with the (ACM) SIGHPC Dissertation Award for 2020. Flick is the first recipient in Georgia Tech history to receive the award which honors one outstanding doctoral dissertation focused on high-performance computing (HPC) research each year.

An invited talk by SCS and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Professor Tom Conte is another notable agenda item. Conte’s talk, HPC After Moore’s Law, discusses the post-Moore computing era as seen from the IEEE Rebooting Computing Initiative perspective, and presents promising technologies to keep a close eye on.
Excitingly, Georgia Tech students are also participating in a virtual student cluster competition (VSCC) this year. While this event hosts the non-stop 72-hour track of a traditional hackathon, the VSCC separates itself from the rest in that the students prepare up to 6 months in advance for the competition.
The Georgia Tech team, Team Phoenix, with sponsorship from vendor partner Penguin Computing, will compete with students from around the globe to complete a set of benchmarks and real-world scientific workloads from Nov. 8 to 11. Each team is tasked to design and build virtual clusters in the Microsoft Azure cloud, learn scientific applications, and apply optimization techniques for their chosen cloud configurations. Daily video interviews with the team can be watched here.
While the conference’s papers, presentations, and competitions are underway, this extraordinary year has required extraordinary efforts to transcend the physical conference barriers. With its first ever fully virtual format, SC20’s platform is bringing the HPC discussion into the hands of more than ever before.
To capitalize on this opportunity of enhancing equity in HPC, Georgia Tech is hosting special virtual programming to run parallel to the SC20 agenda. This programming includes a virtual party and poster show that is open to the public – while space lasts – and a 360-degree data center tour.
The virtual data center tour will be featured on the PACE website and allows users to navigate through Georgia Tech’s premier data center housed at the Coda Building. While walking through the data center, viewers will see the Institute’s two premier HPC resources, the Hive supercomputer, and the newly installed Phoenix cluster.
Need a Note Taker? This AI Can Help.
A new tool that uses artificial intelligence is bringing notetaking up to speed and may help future digital assistants ease fears of ever missing a meeting again.
It’s an age-old problem: We are inundated with informal forms of communication like phone calls, remote video conferences, text conversations on group messaging platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams. Remembering key points of each discussion can at times be overwhelming, not to mention the stress caused by missing a meeting or seeing a couple hundred messages stack up while you were out for lunch.
This digital solution, developed by Georgia Tech researchers and being presented in a paper this week at the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, can assuage those concerns by generating summaries of informal conversations. Using a subset of machine learning called natural language processing, the method identifies conversational structure using particular keywords.
“Think about informal conversational structure: It has an opening, problem statements, discussions, a conclusion,” said Diyi Yang, an assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing and a co-author on the paper. “We want to mine those structures to teach the model what may be informative within the conversation for generating better summaries.”
Words like any variation of “hello” or “good,” for example, might indicate that it is a greeting. Other action words likely indicate some kind of intention, and dates or times a discussion and conclusion on plans. Knowing this, the model can represent the unstructured conversation better to craft an accurate summary.
These types of summaries are more important now than ever. More individuals all over the world are working or attending school remotely. More discussions are being handled over the phone or video conferencing, plans being made through applications like Microsoft Teams. Previous research on the subject has focused on formal content like books, papers, or news articles, but the existing body of work on informal language is relatively sparse.
“This is applicable now more than ever because of where we are,” Yang said. “There’s so much online and text conversation, and we have way too much information. We need help storing it in a shorter and more structured way. If you’re away from your laptop for 30 minutes, it’s important to be able to get a quick summary of what you missed.”
Challenges still exist. There are problems with referral in the conversation, or calling back to a previous discussion point later in a meeting. There are also typos or slang, repetition, interruption or changes in role, language changes that can interfere with the model’s ability to determine structure. These are items Yang and her collaborator are continuing to address moving forward.
“This is a great starting point,” Yang said.
The work is presented in the paper Multi-View Sequence-to-Sequence Models with Conversational Structure for Abstractive Dialogue Summarization. The paper is co-authored by Yang and Jiaao Chen, a second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Interactive Computing.
Gordon Bell Finalist Uses Supercomputing to Connect the Dots
Information overload is all too common in the modern world, particularly in academia. With millions of articles and academic papers, connecting concepts throughout bodies of work is no simple task.
However, a breakthrough created by researchers from Georgia Tech and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) presents a way to link the millions upon millions of data points found throughout volumes of information.
The paper outlining this breakthrough method has been nominated for the 2020 Gordon Bell Prize, which awards outstanding achievements in high-performance (HPC) computing with an emphasis on applying HPC to applications across science, engineering, and large-scale data analytics.
Co-authored by School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Master’s degree student Vijay Thakkar and Professor Rich Vuduc and ORNL researchers Piyush Sao, Hao Lu, Drahomira Herrmannova, Robert Patton, Thomas Patok, Ramakrishnan Kannan this work presents a novel data mining approach to analyze large corpora of scholarly publications with HPC to discover how concepts relate to one another.
“In order to keep pushing the exponential progress of science, we need some level of analysis of different research papers so we can synthesize that into digestible information,” said Thakkar, who currently works in the HPC Garage research lab.
Thakkar joined the HPC Garage, led by Vuduc, one year ago when pursuing research in sparse linear algebra – Vuduc’s area of expertise. However, a few weeks into the independent study, Vuduc approached Thakaar about an opportunity to work with the ORNL team as a CUDA developer. Since then, Thakkar’s research emphasis has focused on facilitating this robust project.
“To me, this project boils down to a very important issue which is that as technological progress becomes faster and faster, for each individual scientist, there is too much information out there to distill into something that is comprehensible. Making connections between different research groups gets harder and harder to do, stalling the progress science can make,” he said.
In this initial project, the team is focusing on processing the articles across PubMed as a particular case study. PubMed is a database of biomedical literature maintained by the National Library of Medicine and currently hosts approximately 18 million papers.
By mining key terms in the papers’ abstracts, the team is able to turn each term into a point, or vertex, in a large-scale graph.
“A term might be the name of a drug or a disease or a symptom, for instance. When two terms appear in the same paper, that means we know there is a direct relationship between them, which becomes an edge in the graph,” said Vuduc.
But just because two terms are not directly linked does not mean they are unrelated; it only means they are not known yet. To find these as-yet undiscovered connections, the idea is to look for short paths that bridge two terms.
Vuduc said, “A useful analogy might be the following: Suppose you are driving from point A to point B. Maybe you know one path to get there. But what if there is a better, shorter way? That’s what this method does. Points are these biological or medical terms or concepts, and road segments are the papers that correspond to known routes. It’s the unknown routes that are interesting.”
These paths are analyzed using a shortest path algorithm referred to as DSNAPSHOT. While shortest path algorithms are not a new concept and are fairly common, the scale at which this particular shortest path algorithm is applied is unheard of.
“If you think about it, six million papers may seem like a small number, but the size of the problem is not really six million. It’s six million times six million because in the worst-case scenario, each paper can have at least one connection to every paper in the database and that is where the complexity of the problem comes from,” said Thakkar.
However, according to Thakkar, the problem is more complex and more difficult to solve than this example – even with today’s supercomputers.
“It’s a much harder problem because you’re visiting each vertex once making this a V3 problem. At the scales we are talking about, this is 18 million times 18 million times 18 million and those orders of magnitude add up really quickly, which is why we need something like the Summit Supercomputer to crunch these numbers,” Thakkar said.
For the team’s first finalist run of 4 million papers it took 30 minutes to compute using over twenty-four thousand GPUs of the Summit machine. What’s more, the time this type of problem will require to solve will continue to grow in a cubic manner with each paper added to PubMed database.
The announcement of the Gordon Bell Prize winner will be made at the 2020 Supercomputing Conference award ceremony held, Nov. 19 at 2 p.m. EST.
New Grant Helps Researchers Bring Cybersecurity into the Physical World
Imagine if you could physically feel a threat to your digital security – perhaps a vibration on your wrist to alert you to nearby danger. What kinds of precautions would you take if you felt these digital threats the same way you felt those of the physical world?
Like carrying a can of pepper spray when walking down a dark alleyway – or avoiding the alleyway altogether – a new project out of Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing (IC) aims to connect this abstract world of cybersecurity and privacy with concrete physical environments to promote better security behavior.
“In the real world, we have these corporeal sensations that give us cues on how to act,” said IC Assistant Professor Sauvik Das, the principal investigator on the project. “If you feel a cold breeze on your cheek, you may decide to wear a scarf. If you are walking down a dark alleyway, you may become more alert and aware of your surroundings. It’s a different story in the present state of cybersecurity and privacy.”
That current state is mostly limited to a warning when you’re leaving a secure network on your computer or a pop-up box that might caution against proceeding to a specific website. But what about the digital threats we face daily when proceeding throughout our daily routines, perusing the internet on our phones or walking through a crowded airport?
There are no corporeal sensory perception cues that indicate what is threatening or worthy of our attention. Similarly, we don’t have affordances that allow us to manipulate digital interfaces in ways that will better protect us against these threats that we find salient.
“That’s the idea here,” Das said. “We want to solve this abstraction problem by physically alerting people to threats and giving them means to defend against them.”
The project presents three solutions to the digital abstraction problem – Spidey Sense, Bit Whisperer, and Horcrux. Each aims to solves a specific branch of the problem: notifying you to threats, giving you more effective means to defend against threats, and providing means to better govern shared resources.
Spidey Sense
Spidey Sense uses a wristband that integrates with modern Apple watches that can squeeze the wrist in programmable patterns to notify the wearer of perceived digital threats.
The idea is that people might not feel the threat through visual communication design the same way they might when walking down a dark alleyway at night.
“How can we similarly communicate that threat?” Das poses. “This field of affective haptics was a good bridge.”
Bit Whisperer
So, what do you do when you know threats exist? In the real world, one might intuit that to block entry into a room they could place a heavy object in front of a door or that to communicate secure information they might need to whisper. This project aims to present similar options for digital information.
“It’s like whispering through the digital world,” Das said.
To transfer data from one smart device to another, one might use Bluetooth. But one can’t see the bits traveling through the air as they are communicated. Bit Whisperer uses physical objects, like a table, to communicate.
Using inaudible sound frequencies that can be generated through smartphones, data is transmitted through the physical surface from one device to other devices on the same surface. Anyone off the surface can’t receive the data without physically placing their device on it, making it much more challenging for would-be attackers.
Horcrux
Horcrux is a more abstract project at present. It aims to assist individuals governing shared digital resources. Current state of the art provides point-and-click resources, but those make it impossible to multitask and challenging to specify access controls.
This project, like the others, aims to provide physical tools that can be manipulated by hand to make it easier to specify access.
The idea now is a mat where play pieces like figurines can represent people or resources that people own.
“Think of a castle where you can move figurines through different accesses,” Das said. “These tangible interfaces allow for more interaction, more multitasking, and visible physical representations for what everyone has access to.”
These projects are being funded by a $500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation. IC Professor Gregory Abowd is a co-principal investigator on the grant, and Ph.D. student Youngwook Do is a key contributor.
Computing Now Teaching Every Undergrad, Often Multiple Times
As it celebrates its 30th anniversary, the College of Computing at Georgia Tech is well-poised and ready for the next decade.
The College of Computing was established in 1990 and was the first of its kind at a public university. Since then, it has grown to the point that now Computer Science (CS) is the largest undergraduate major at Georgia Tech.
Dean of Computing Charles Isbell talked about this growth during a recent deep dive into the state of the College as part of a live virtual session with staff and faculty.
“Computing is the youngest of six colleges, but it has experienced so much growth in the past three decades that now Computing accounts for about 39 percent of students,” said Isbell, who holds the John P. Imlay Chair in Computing.
Reaching Students
From Fall 2015 to Fall 2020 the number of undergraduate students in the College grew from 1,988 to 3,309. Enrollment in the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program grew from 2,784 in Fall 2015 to 10,559 in Fall 2020. Total enrollment rose from 5,750 to 15,245 during the same span.
“Small ‘c’ computing has become integral to the advancement of just about every discipline to such an extent that we, big ‘C’ Computing, are now to teaching every undergraduate student on campus, often multiple times,” said Isbell.
As the number of Computing students grows, the College has become more diverse. For the academic year 2019/20, 15.8 percent of undergraduates in the College were underrepresented minorities, while 25.2 percent of Computing undergrads were female.
“Increasing the diversity of the student body is a priority for the College. A diversity of backgrounds brings with it a diversity of opinions and experiences, which is critically important to our ongoing success,” said Isbell.
Faculty Matters
The College’s faculty, along with the number of endowed chairs, has also grown in the past several years. During the academic year 2019/20, the College had 131 academic faculty members and 47 researcher faculty members.
This number is expected to grow in 2021 as new tenure-track faculty are hired to support the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy, which was announced in September.
There’s also been recent growth in the number of endowed chairs in the College. Faculty members currently hold 12 endowed chairs. Two new chairs – the Krishna A. Bharat Chair in Computational Journalism and the Zvi Galil Chair for Pervasive Equitable Access for Computing Education – were established within the past 18 months. Each of these is expected to be filled in 2021.
“Much of our recent and anticipated growth correlates with what’s happening in our degree programs. It also maps to our faculty and graduate student research. In the past decade, there has been substantial growth in cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analysis research,” said Isbell.
“And this year, GT Computing researchers have been at the forefront of fighting Covid-19 with computing.”
Research Rising
Since the pandemic began, faculty and graduate student researchers have contributed to nearly a dozen Covid-related research projects, many funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). At least one of these, a tracking model used to predict the spread of Covid-19, gained national media attention.
In fiscal year 2019, the College earned more than $34 million in research funding. Along with funding for Covid-19 research, recent awards include a $27 million US Army grant to develop resilient robot teams, as well as:
- $7.5 million from the Office of Naval Research to develop a customized attack-resistant software stack.
- $4.5 million from DARPA to build a new programming system for software-defined hardware.
- $2 million from the NSF to bring better network coverage to Native American communities.
- $1.5 million from NSF for a program that addresses the issue of increasing diversity in the data science field.
- $1.2 million from the NSF to create a computational assessment kit for PTSD in veterans.
Strategic Priorities
Some of these research awards point to another area that has developed within the College during the past decade, responsible computing.
In late 2017, the College established the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech. Among the many programs it houses, the Center partners with K through 12 educators to open CS education to more students from more diverse backgrounds. Since it launched, the Center has provided AP CS instruction to more than 500 students from seven Atlanta public high schools. The Center has also provided professional development support to hundreds of educators and administrators from around the world.
“Whether it’s expanding equal and equitable access to computing education, or focusing on the ethical considerations of AI, one of the College’s top strategic priorities is to become the #1 destination for responsible computing,” said Isbell.
Ph.D. Student is Rising Star in Computer Science
Thaleia Dimitra Doudali, a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science, was selected for Rising Stars 2020.
Held from Nov. 9 to 10, the University of California, Berkeley workshop is aimed at increasing women in academic careers in computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering. Doudali was one of 152 women from 68 institutions who was chosen for her academic excellence, faculty career goals, and equity and inclusion work. The women were mentored by 87 from top-10 institutions.
“Getting selected as a rising star provides me with the endorsement of an elite selection committee that my research contributions and skills are appropriate for me to succeed in academia, boosting my confidence and candidate profile,” Doudali said.
Doudali’s research focuses on building machine intelligent data management for systems with hybrid memory components. The novelty, impact, and practicality of her approach led to a best paper award finalist at HPDC ’19.

“I received valuable advice on how to navigate the academic job search and career, and made wonderful connections with peers and mentors,” Doudali said. “I am grateful for the opportunity and recognition.”
She was also selected to present her thesis at the SC ’20 Doctoral Showcase, has received diversity grants to attend Usenix ATC ’20 and OSDI ’20, and presented her latest publication in MEMSYS ’20. She is advised by Associate Professor Ada Gavrilovska.
Renowned Roboticist Departing Georgia Tech for New Position
After serving as chair of Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing (IC) for three years, Ayanna Howard has accepted a position at another institution.
In a news release published today, The Ohio State University announced that it has hired Howard as the dean of its College of Engineering. Howard begins her new job on March 1. She will be the first woman to lead engineering at Ohio State.
“Ayanna has unbounded energy and the ability to share her passion for AI and robotics. Through her students, her research, her entrepreneurship, and in her own story, Ayanna has made both her fields of study and Georgia Tech better. She is truly inspiring. We’re grateful for her tremendous contributions and wish her continued success in her new role,” said Charles Isbell, dean of the College of Computing, which houses the School of Interactive Computing.
According to Isbell, an interim chair for the School of IC will be named for the spring semester. A search for a new chair will also begin in the spring.
Howard, also the Linda J. and Mark C. Smith Chair Professor in the School of IC and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), will continue to advise and work with her current Ph.D. students.
Howard joined Georgia Tech in 2005 as an associate professor in the School of ECE. She is the founder and director of the Human-Automation Systems Lab. Following a national search in 2017, Georgia Tech announced that Howard had been selected as chair of the School of IC. She began her term as chair in Spring 2018.
Howard will serve a five-year term as dean, according to the Ohio State release. She will also be a tenured professor in the College of Engineering’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and hold a joint appointment in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
New Chair Leads the School of Computer Science into a Collaborative Future
Community has always been important to Vivek Sarkar. The opportunity to be part the College of Computing’s collaborative environment led him to the School of Computer Science (SCS) in 2017.
Now as its new chair, Sarkar wants to increase the scale of the school’s research leadership.
“Georgia Tech is a place where we can do big things at scale, make big bets, and be very supportive of our colleagues,” he said of taking on the role.
Finding a future in post-Moore
Sarkar started his career in parallel computing at IBM, but he saw new potential with the end of Moore’s law — the expectation that transistors double annualy in a commodity semiconductor chip.
“The entire computing ecosystem that we have right now in the cloud is predicated on rich system software stacks contributed to by worldwide open-source communities,” he said. “As hardware gets more complicated, a primary concern is that it becomes harder to program in ways that are only accessible to a small number of people with advanced degrees.”
While at Rice University, he created his research group, the Habanero Extreme Scale Research Laboratory, to develop an entire software stack for the new post-Moore world of heterogeneous hardware. Now, at Georgia Tech, the Habanero lab includes five research faculty members and 11 Ph.D. students.
Partnering with faculty in this area was vital for his research into software for future hardware, and what attracted Sarkar to the College.
“One of my big draws for coming to Georgia Tech was having colleagues who are world experts in post-Moore computing,” he said. “Tom Conte’s creation of the Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH) provided a great framework for my research group when I arrived.”
It didn’t take long for Sarkar to participate in multiple collaborative research efforts on campus. Conte invited Sarkar to become the co-director of CRNCH to help broaden the center’s research scope. Sarkar also led a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) $4.5 million project on software-defined hardware with Conte and Professor Richard Vuduc at Georgia Tech, and other faculty at University of Illinois, University of Michigan, and University of Southern California.
He has other research collaborations under way with fellow SCS faculty: Assistant Professor David Devecsery, Associate Professor Taesoo Kim, Senior Research Scientist Jeffrey Young, and Assistant Professor Qirun Zhang, as well as a the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Assistant Professor Tushar Krishna.

Serving the community
Yet service is just as important to Sarkar as research. He has always served both the global and local computing community.
“When you are part of a community, it’s great to be able to contribute in every way you can,” he said.
Sarkar is on the Computing Research Association’s Board of Directors and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Scientific Computing Advisory Committee (ASCAC). He is also an Association of Computing Machinery Fellow and was recently named an IEEE fellow.
Yet as the Stephen P. Fleming Chair in Telecommunications, the service he does within the school and College has been just as important to him. In 2018, he served on the school’s Faculty Recruiting Committee and chaired it in 2019. He also was chair of the School Advisory Committee and a member of dean’s search committee.
Becoming chair of SCS is another form of service for him.
“Service is leadership, and leadership is service — it’s integral to what we do as professors,” he said.
As a leader of SCS, Sarkar wants to bring the same collaborative spirit he’s found throughout the College.
“One of my goals is to really boost our leadership in the core areas that our school contributes to the college that span architecture, databases, networking, programming languages, software engineering, systems, and theory,” he said.
“I’m really keen to figure out how we can integrate research areas where appropriate to put together some really amazing and unique demonstrations of what can be done at Georgia Tech,” he said. “We’ve hired eight junior faculty members in the last three years who span all these core areas, and have added a new level of energy to the school.”
Team at Pindrop receives ‘Test of Time’ Award at ACM CCS 2020
A Georgia Tech a faculty member and an alumnus are being honored with a Test of Time Award. Mustaque Ahamad and Vijay Balasubramaniyan received the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) award for their paper on Pindrop.
Ahamad is a professor in the College of Computing and Pindrop co-founder and chief scientist. Along with being a Georgia Tech alumnus, Balasubramaniyan is co-founder and CEO of Pindrop.
The paper, titled PinDr0p: Using Single-Ended Audio Features to Determine Call Provenance, was a team effort supported by Balasubramaniyan, Ahamad, Aamir Poonawalla, Michael T. Hunter, and Patrick Traynor. According to Balasubramaniyan, it has had a significant impact on security research and practice.
“We are so honored to have received this award,” said Balasubramaniyan. “This shows the impact this research has had in a world of instant gratification.”
Published in 2010, the research details the team’s novel approach to identifying and characterizing networks used to make calls in order to create detailed fingerprints for a call’s source. This approach can distinguish between calls made using cellular, internet, or land lines from locations across the world with over 90 percent accuracy, which is the first step in accurately determining the provenance of a call.
Pindrop was inspired by a trip to India and a call from Balasubramaniyan’s bank to verify a charge to one of his credit accounts.
“I received a call to verify a transaction,” said Balasubramaniyan. “They wanted information to verify my identity — social security number and date of birth — however, I wanted to verify that it was truly the bank calling me.”
The idea took off from there and the team now works with eight of the top 10 national banks and continues to expand its research features — now at over 1,300.
"We're building on research that is now established as a Test of Time paper," said Balasubramaniyan. "It's really amazing."
Preparing for Emergency Response with Partial Network Information
Natural disasters cause considerable economic damage, loss of life, and network disruptions each year. As emergency response and infrastructure systems are interdependent and interconnected, quick assessment and repair in the event of disruption is critical.
School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Associate Professor B. Aditya Prakash is leading a collaborative effort with researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Oklahoma, University of Iowa, and University of Virginia to determine the state of an infrastructure network during such a disruption. Prakash’s group has also been collaborating closely with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory on such problems in critical infrastructure networks.
However, according to Prakash, quickly determining which infrastructure components are damaged in the event of a disaster is not easily done after a disruption.
“If there is a disruption caused by an earthquake or hurricane and some things go down in the power grid, critical infrastructure system, transportation network, or the energy distribution network, how do you figure out what things have failed?” asked Prakash.
“The big problem in figuring out what has gone wrong is that all of these networks are highly decentralized and spread out. Usually there will be no central command or ‘oracle’ that immediately knows perfectly what is out, what is on, what is fine, and what is not.”
Given these networks’ decentralized organization and sparse installation of real-time monitoring systems, only a partial observation of the network is typically available after a disaster.
By using connectivity queries to map network states, Prakash’s team outlines in their recent paper how to determine the damage of an entire network from the portion of observable and operational nodes.
The team aims to infer failed network components by examining two-node characteristics: The partial information available from reachable nodes and a small sample of point probes which are typically more practical to obtain in a failure.
Modeling their research on real utility network data gathered by the University of Oklahoma, Prakash’s team proposes using an information-theoretic formulation called the minimum description length (MDL) principle. This is the notion that the best way to describe any data is the shortest one. Hence the researchers try to find those failed components, particularly the critical ones affecting overall system performance, which contain enough information to effectively minimize the MDL cost.
Alexander Rodriguez, a CSE Ph.D. student and lead author, will present the findings of this research this week at the 2020 Neural Processing and Information Systems (NeurIPS) conference as part of the Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response.

Sehoon Ha Part of $500k Grant to Make Safer, More Deployable Robots
Safety is arguably the biggest barrier to large-scale deployability of humanoid assistive robots.
Large, heavy, and with the potential to suddenly fall over all mean that the risk to humans has remained too high to place this technology in homes, hospitals, retail spaces, or care facilities.
In 2016, however, researchers at UCLA posed a solution: What if we made robots that just couldn’t fall down? Now, researchers at Georgia Tech, in collaboration with UCLA and the University of Southern California, are working to develop a new class of locomotion systems that could enable this technology to become a larger part of our daily lives.
“We have lots of robots,” said Sehoon Ha, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing and a co-principal investigator on the project. “But they aren’t in our house or in our stores. It’s mainly because of safety. I have a young daughter. I wouldn’t be comfortable with a full-sized humanoid robot in my house.”
Previously, UCLA developed a new class of robots called “buoyancy-assisted robots.” Instead of the human-like hardware that was bulky, heavy, and subject to the pitfalls of gravity, these legged robots remained erect thanks to a body made of helium balloons.
“Even though there is some mechanical or motor error, it never falls,” Ha said. “It never breaks. It’s super light. Even if it might collide with you, it doesn’t fall and it can’t hurt you.”
Creating a new class of locomotion systems has a couple of challenges: designing a new hardware that is cheap and safe and developing an algorithm that supports locomotion and collaboration. This grant will support development of novel frameworks that address a fundamentally new family of legged robots and empower them with reliable locomotion skills.
“The main philosophy is to deploy the reinforcement learning on real hardware,” Ha said. “This buoyancy-assisted robot is subject to a relatively larger magnitude of drag forces. It’s hard to simulate it. There’s a discrepancy between simulation and the real world. We want to collect real-world experience and limit the reality gap.”
The technology could help carry out a search and rescue in a disaster relief zone or answer a question in a retail space. The new project, funded by a $500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation’s National Robotics Initiative, will help create new locomotion control systems using reinforcement learning to improve the state of this technology.
Already cheaper than its bulkier counterparts, these robots could be as inexpensive as a couple hundred dollars produced at scale, Ha said.
“Now you might imagine a scenario where you could drop 1,000 of these into a disaster area to carry our search and rescue missions,” he said.
The grant runs for four years and research from the project will be open-source to encourage additional collaboration. The grant will also support a competition for middle and high school students using the low-cost platforms to foster student interest in the field.
Q&A: De'Aira Bryant Discusses Her Experience Programming a Robot for the Movie Superintelligence
De’Aira Bryant didn’t come to Georgia Tech to work in the movie industry. Her interests lie within the field of robotics, where she works on projects that will increase the quality of human life.
Being in the heart of Atlanta, however, the burgeoning heart of the film industry, comes with a few perks. Last year, Bryant was able to take advantage of one when she was contacted by representatives from the production crew of Superintelligence. The movie stars Melissa McCarthy as a woman who must prove to an artificial intelligence that humanity is worth saving and was recently released on HBO Max.
For the movie, Bryant was asked to program a Nao, a humanoid robot she uses in the Human-Automation Systems (HumAnS) Lab run by her advisor, School of Interactive Computing Chair Ayanna Howard. Read about Bryant’s experience programming the biggest star on the set.
How did this opportunity to work with Superintelligence come about, and what was the experience like?
The production team reached out to the College of Computing. They were interested in having a robot for a scene and needed someone who could program the Nao to match the scene they had written. They reached out to Dr. Howard because they knew she had that type of robot, and she reached out to me because I’m the person who does most of the customized programming for this particular robot. If there’s a script or movements or whatever, I’m the choreographer.
It was exciting. I was like, “Oh my goodness, this is for a movie.” I had no idea what it was about, but I was just excited to be a part of it. They asked if their ideas were possible and the production team was like, “We don’t know what it can do, but we think it looks cool. Can you make it do this?” We talked on the phone, and then I went to work.
How long did you have to program it?
I had about a week to get it ready. I had this idea of what they wanted, and I just tried to program it as best as I could.
So, tell me about the day of. What was it like being on set?
I took the robot to the Klaus Advanced Computing Building. They were filming in there. It was so exciting to see everything. I had to tell the robot to go on their cue, so I was sitting right behind the camera. I got to meet Melissa McCarthy and some of the other stars, and I got a few pictures with them that I’m excited to finally be able to share with everyone. Everyone was so welcoming and understanding that the robot needed some time. I like to say that the robot was the biggest superstar on the set. It had its moments where it was like, “I’m not ready yet. My joint isn’t quite ready to do this movement.” They were understanding and eager to learn. They wanted their own pictures with the robot and everything, and had their own questions that I was excited to answer.
A lot of non-roboticists or AI researchers’ first experiences with robots is in mass media like movies or TV shows, and normally its some dystopian or disaster scenario. How seriously did you take that responsibility or opportunity to portray the lighter, more realistic side?
I think for a lot of people, robots – especially these humanoid ones – have been largely portrayed negatively. They focus on disaster cases they may never happen in the next 100 years, if ever. There hasn’t been a lot of mass media attention that focuses on more positive use cases. I take that very seriously in our work, just knowing that we focus on people, on children that can benefit from the technology and have it improve their quality of life. It’s important to show those cases to affect the narrative. But we also want to highlight the concerns that are just. Things like bias and ethics of using robotics in certain domains. Those are real things that people are working to mitigate now, so we can bring people closer to what the field actually looks like by highlighting both.
Every time I teach kids or teach a class, I start out by showing what robots can actually do. I show videos of them falling over or something like that to illustrate that those terminators or killer robots, that doesn’t happen right now. But there are some other issues that are real and current and pressing, and here’s how we address them.
Being at Georgia Tech with movies filmed nearby has offered these kinds of neat opportunities. How neat is it to have this platform?
My friends think it’s so much cooler that I helped work on a movie that is going to be on HBO Max than for me to have some paper published at this really prestigious conference. The movie resonates with them more, so it’s an opportunity to have a connection. They can relate to the technology in a way that is natural to them and ask questions, and I can share more about robotics and my work. That’s how we get people interested in the field.
'Outliers' Author Chats with Dean During a 'Return to the 404'
What do you think might prompt writer and best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell to say, “That’s the most Atlanta thing I’ve ever heard”?
You can find out in the latest episode of Gladwell’s podcast, Revisionist History. Here’s a bit of a spoiler that might not be too surprising. The most Atlanta thing he’s ever heard has to do with Georgia Tech Dean of Computing Charles Isbell.
It turns out that Atlanta is one of Gladwell’s favorite cities. In fact, the New Yorker writer devoted two recent episodes of his podcast to the ATL – Druid Hills and Return to the 404. Along with having a passion for the city, Gladwell also has a connection to Georgia Tech. His father, a mathematics professor, visited the Institute in the late 1950’s to do research.
Gladwell uses this story as a springboard for a conversation with Isbell who is an Atlanta native and a Georgia Tech alumnus. During the segment, which leads the episode, the two talk about the city they both love, how Georgia Tech has changed since Gladwell’s father visited in 1959, and why there’s reason for optimism and hope.
As for the most Atlanta thing that Gladwell has ever heard, you’ll have to listen to the podcast to find out.
Research Team Wins Two Covid-19 Challenges in One Week Configure
School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Ph.D. student Alexander Rodriguez and Associate Professor B. Aditya Prakash are enabling new data-driven solutions for pandemic response. Their research, which focuses on influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and Covid-19, garnered global attention by securing two awards for Covid-19-related challenges within the same week in mid-December.
Rodriguez and Prakash joined CSE a little over one year ago while working on data science and artificial intelligence research with epidemiological applications, including the development of historical models for influenza forecasting. Shortly after their move to Georgia Tech, the Covid-19 outbreak began.
For nearly a year since Prakash’s group has led the charge on numerous Covid-19 research endeavors.
Of these endeavors, their work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using deep learning models to forecast Covid-19 spread, such as hospitalizations and mortalities, may be one of the most prominent efforts. These models’ predictions are currently being used by public officials and healthcare providers across the country to help track and combat the novel coronavirus.
[Related News: Team Using Deep Learning to Forecast Pandemic in the U.S.]
[Related News: Scientists Collaborating on New Data-Driven Approach to Covid-19 Intervention]
Now, the team is expanding their work with the CDC to apply their research to broader challenges including the C3.ai Covid-19 Grand Challenge and the Facebook Covid-19 Symptom Data Challenge.
Both challenges asked teams to create innovative approaches for enabling new solutions to pandemic response using proprietary data sets.
“We have been exploring data-driven methods for public health broadly, including for disease forecasting. Given that both of these competitions focused on leveraging novel data sources, it seemed like a very good fit for what we were working on,” said Prakash.
“But we wanted to take it one step further because we also wanted to bring our flu-forecasting experience into this.”
According to Prakash, the team has gained a wealth of knowledge and experience from working on these real-time data competitions.
He said, “It’s one thing to write a nice academic research paper about a clean problem – but in a real-time pandemic-emerging scenario where you don’t know what is going to happen when there is so much uncertainty, there is so much more to navigate. And fundamentally, we felt we were well-placed to tackle these challenges.”
Preparing Hospitals for Covid-19 and Flu Season
The C3.ai global competition encouraged research teams to use the C3.ai data lake to drive fundamental change in building state-of-the-art data science methods to enhance Covid-19 response.
According to Prakash and Rodriguez, ILIs and Covid-19 exhibit symptomatic similarities which affect one another’s level of reported cases and therefore need to be taken into consideration when addressing disease spread. Given this consideration, they saw the C3.ai challenge as an opportunity to expand on their ILI and Covid-19 research with the new data provided.
Their proposed framework, DeepOutbreak, secured second place out of 777 participants by presenting a framework to better inform response strategies using datasets provided by C3.ai. It accomplishes this by modeling the progression of Covid-19 and symptomatically similar co-evolving ILIs to support optimal deployment of healthcare resources.
“Machine learning techniques allow us to directly ingest data signals that may be better representing what is happening on the ground. Our framework is useful in forecasting the spread of both Covid-19 and influenza in the chaotic circumstances we are facing. We found our predictions complement other, more traditional, approaches for epidemic forecasting,” said Rodriguez.
The DeepOutbreak framework was developed with Bijaya Adhikari from the University of Iowa, and Anika Tabassum, Nikhil Muralidhar, and Naren Ramakrishnan from Virginia Tech. This very same team continued on from the C3.ai challenge to take first place out of 55 organizations for the Facebook Covid-19 Symptom Data Challenge that same week.
Predicting Covid-19 Trends Using Facebook Data
Similar to the C3.ai competition, the Facebook challenge asked teams from across the world to develop a novel analytic approach to enable earlier detection and improved situational awareness of the Covid-19 outbreak using Facebook Covid-19 data.
The Facebook Covid-19 data was gathered by administering a survey on the social media platform which asked respondents about symptoms.
“As it is well known, Covid-19 and the flu share similar symptoms, like a cough or a fever. So, we wanted to understand if their symptomatic data helps us to differentiate between these diseases because they can interact, have similar symptoms, and can contaminate each other’s surveillance systems,” said Prakash.
The DeepOutbreak team secured a first-place victory in the challenge by characterizing different facets of the utility of the symptom survey data from Facebook. They found the novel data could help in predictive accuracy and also to anticipate changes in trends in the epidemic curves of both Covid-19 and ILIs.
As the winner, the team’s analytic design will be featured on the Facebook Data for Good website and partner forums, including blogs and community websites.
“Our data collection pulls from Google, CDC, and other institutions. Complementing these data sets with the Facebook data helped us find these trends,” said Rodriguez.
According to Rodriguez, the Facebook data helped fill the gap in symptomatic data by it being readily accessible to people who are experiencing symptoms but not going to healthcare providers or taking Covid-19 tests.
Student Receives NVIDIA Fellowship
Sana Damani has won a 2021 NVIDIA Graduate Fellowship for her research on compiler optimizations for GPU hardware.
The School of Computer Science (SCS) Ph.D. student received one of five fellowships for 2021-2022 from a pool of more than 350 applicants. The fellowship includes $50,000 in research funding, an NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU), and a guaranteed summer internship.
“The fellowship is a great honor,” Damani said. “I am very excited about the opportunity to go back to NVIDIA, and further my research on GPU compiler optimizations.”
This is not Damani’s first experience with the company. She was an engineer at NVIDIA for five years before starting her Ph.D. at Georgia Tech in 2017. Her work enables programmers to exploit GPU hardware features to improve performance. She specifically works on compiler optimization, which transforms a program to run with improved performance on a specific architecture.
GPUs are used to accelerate deep learning, gaming, visual effects, and high-performance computing applications. They also power 40 percent of the TOP500 supercomputers. As a result, compiler optimizations for GPUs can speed up a wide range of applications.
One thread in her research has been to redesign classical compiler optimizations so that they can be applied to the unique hardware characteristics of GPUs. As an example, Damani redesigned common subexpression elimination, a well-known compiler transformation, so that it can be used to identify duplicate code across diverged threads in GPUs and instead execute them in a converged parallel code region. This optimization results in a reduced execution time.
Another project she has worked on is speculative reconvergence. This programmer-guided compiler optimization improves performance by maximizing parallelism within time-consuming code blocks.
Damani’s research has also been used to accelerate real-time ray tracing, a computer graphics technique for creating realistic lighting in video games, as well as Monte Carlo simulations used in physics, finance, and medicine. She is advised by SCS Chair Vivek Sarkar and is a member of the Habanero Extreme Scale Software Research Lab.
“I was delighted to hear that Sana had been selected for this highly competitive fellowship award,” Sarkar said. “It is a well-deserved recognition of her accomplishments and future potential.”
Linear Systems Research Wins SODA Best Paper Award
School of Computer Science researchers have won the best paper award at ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) for their new approach to solving linear systems.
Assistant Professor Richard Peng and Professor Santosh Vempala, who holds the Frederick Storey Chair in Computing, discovered that by combining symbolic computing tools with random matrix theory, sparse linear systems can be solved slightly faster than directly invoking matrix multiplication / inversion.
SODA is the premier conference in algorithms and is known to be highly competitive. This year’s conference received 637 submissions and accepted 180 papers. Although up to three papers can be selected, the program committee chose just one paper for the best paper award.
The history of linear systems
Solving a linear system is one of the most foundational computational problems in science and engineering.
“This problem has been around for a long time, even before computers,” said Vempala. “Much of modern computation runs on linear systems — including recommendation engines like web search, machine learning, and scientific computing simulations.”
Algorithms for solving systems of linear equations are taught as early as grade school, with the most common ones involving manipulating matrices, which in turn represent coefficients on the variables. Yet as their applications become more complex, these methods become less efficient as the matrices become more costly to manipulate.
“The matrix-based algorithms work fine when you have a room full of mechanical calculators trying to solve a system on 50 variables, where the matrix fits on a single large blackboard,” said Peng. “One of the big differences in modern data is this matrix gets really big: instead of 50x50, it’s a billion x billion. Most of the entries start off as 0s, so it’s often not even feasible to write down dense matrices such as the inverse due to storage constraints.”
One example of a large sparse matrix is modern networks. The matrix for a website has every vertex link to another website, creating a gigantic matrix. This matrix is also naturally sparse: it’s mostly made up of 0s. Similar situations also arise in everything from weather simulation to measuring road traffic. As a result, tremendous computing power, including supercomputers, has been devoted to solving linear systems and problems related to them. For a long time, problems related to solving linear systems routinely consumed the most computational power, until the recent emergence of blockchains.
Since the 1970s, computer scientists have preferred using iterative methods to solve large sparse linear systems due to the difficulty of storing dense matrices corresponding to inverses. Surprisingly little is known about the best possible runtime guarantees of these algorithms on arbitrary systems; analyzing iterative methods is particularly complex because more and more bits need to be maintained with each step to ensure overall accuracy.
Speedups via batching
Peng and Vempala realized they could solve the systems using fewer steps by considering many partial solutions in parallel. Instead of iterating one vector at a time, they iterate on a block of s vectors. This reduces the number of iterations, and effectively the overhead in bit complexity, from n to n / s.
On the other hand, the interactions between the batches of s vectors across different steps become more complex. Instead of a single value, they become s-by-s blocks.
More surprisingly, the interactions across steps are also structured. In the Gram matrix, which measures the pair-wise projections between steps, the interactions between steps that add up to the same value are exactly the same. Effectively steps 1 and 7, steps 2 and 6, and steps 3 and 5 all have the same interactions.Turning this idea into an algorithm relies on generalized tools developed from symbolic computing, namely for Hankel matrices, to work in this more general block setting.
Semi-random matrices
Symbolic computing methods are limited because they only work under exact arithmetic. Many previous works studied systems over finite fields, where there are no round-off errors. So existing literature does not address the bit-complexity issue at the crux of the runtime efficiency of iterative methods.
In order to bound the bit complexity of intermediate steps, a major undertaking in this research became lower bounding how close the block Krylov space is to being degenerate, or equivalently, how stable is the computation. A simplified version of this phenomenon arises inpicking n random numbers between 0 and 1: the closest pair should be roughly n-2 apart. For the block Krylov method, however, this analysis has to be done to the batches of high-dimensional vectors that arise throughout the iterative steps.
The research critically builds upon ideas developed from smoothed analysis: the study of near-degeneracies in problems under small random perturbations. This is a field of study going back two decades, originating with the study of perturbed linear programs.
Wide implications
The new algorithm is a significant contribution to not only linear systems solving, but also the understanding of optimization and random matrix theory. “The conjecture was that you cannot solve a system faster than matrix multiplication,” said Vempala. “The fact you can go beyond that opens up entire new lines of research.”
The researchers will present the paper, Solving Sparse Linear Systems Faster than Matrix Multiplication, at SODA Jan. 10 through 13.
Undergraduates Design Covid Forecasting Dashboard
Predicting Covid-19’s spread has been one of the pandemic’s biggest challenges. A team of undergraduates however, has created a forecasting dashboard that aggregates and compares prediction data to determine most likely outcomes.
The web-based dashboard also lets users compare their predictions to professional models, giving users insight into how to build better forecasts.
The problem with forecasting
Accurate forecasting models are vital to pandemic safety because they can influence public policy and healthcare resource allocation. Yet Covid-19 has been especially hard to predict because its spread is affected by region, season, and other factors.
The idea of combining forecasts comes from forecasting competitions traditionally used to determine the outcome of elections, or the success of businesses, where rewards are given for accurate predictions.
“Competitive forecast mechanisms can be very useful for making predictions in uncertain environments,” College of Computing undergraduate researcher Gayeon Yoo said. “A number of studies have shown the benefits of trusting the ‘wisdom of the crowd.’”
Aggregating the data
The website combines various Covid-19 databases and predictions from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), Columbia University, and Georgia Tech for case and death totals. The site determines their accuracy by calculating the mean squared error of the models by prediction time: a week, two weeks, four weeks, and overall. The most accurate forecasts are ranked on the Top Forecasters page.
Users can also provide their own forecasts and learn later how their forecasts performed relative to other users and professional modelers.
“Seeing how your predictions compare to others on different outcomes such as daily cases or daily deaths is what intrigues users,” New York University undergraduate researcher Rachel Ombok said. “Being able to see the shift in your own predictions and see what your forecasts over time can be useful to researchers, and also helps to engage users who may have private information about the pandemic’s spread in their region.”
The team believes the ranking system encourages users to develop better prediction models by creating a competitive environment around forecast accuracy.
Future iterations of the site will include more data to forecast on hospitalizations and infections, as well segment by country, state, and other regions. The team also plans to make the interface more customizable so users can write their own programs and use statistics or machine learning for automated submissions.
“We want people to see what forecast modeling is like first-hand, and we also want to use our evaluation metrics to quantify the accuracy of user and institution forecasts,” College undergraduate Aniruddha Murali said.
The website was created by College of Computing undergraduates Murali and Yoo and New York University undergraduate Ombok.
The project is part of a Covid-19 Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) started by School of Computer Science Assistant Professor Jake Abernethy with School of Computational Science and Engineering Associate Professor Aditya Prakash, University of Michigan Assistant Professor Eric Schwartz, and University of Colorado Assistant Professor Bo Waggoner. The project was funded by the National Science Foundation and Georgia Tech’s Institute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS).
Team Phoenix Takes Home a Top Ranking in Premier HPC Competition
A group of undergraduate students from Georgia Tech, dubbed Team Phoenix, has claimed the third-highest overall score in the premier high-performance computing (HPC) student competition of 2020.
The Student Cluster Competition (SCC) is an immersive 72-hour HPC challenge held as part of the Supercomputing Conference Series (SC). SCC presents undergraduate students with real-world scientific workloads, a series of benchmarks, and even a mystery challenge to overcome.
[Related News: High-Performance Computing for All, Everywhere]
This achievement marks just the second time that a Georgia Tech team was accepted to the competition. Despite a Georgia Tech group not competing since 2017, this year’s challengers were prepped and ready to become the only team outside of China to place in the top three of 19 competing organizations.
“The success of Georgia Tech's SC20 Student Cluster Competition team was a thrill to witness. We feel strongly about providing students with opportunities to experience HPC. Our strategic partners from industry and national labs tell us demand for HPC skills continues to rise and initiatives like the SCC help cultivate interest in HPC careers,” said Team Phoenix coach and School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Research Technologist Will Powell.
Team Phoenix’s student competitors include computer science undergraduates Sudhanshu Agarwal, Albert Chen, Aman Jain, Ali Kazmi, Nicole Prindle, and Marissa Sorkin. This team of six was selected from a Spring 2020 Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) course focused on using HPC systems and applications.
VIP instructors Rich Vuduc, Aaron Jezghani, Will Powell, and Jeff Young helped lead the group along with CSE graduate student Vijay Thakkar, who served as the team mentor.
Supported by the VIP program and the leadership of the five coaches, the students engaged in the long-term, large-scale project that took nearly a year of planning to achieve before the competition had even started.
Part of this initial planning period was used to identify and recruit sponsorship for the team’s machine configuration. Vendor partner Penguin Computing answered the call by providing hardware support and sponsorship of Team Phoenix, while Intel and NVIDIA both shared expertise related to application optimization and HPC tools.
Due to Covid-19, the competition was moved to the Microsoft Azure cloud to accommodate remote participation, becoming the first-ever Virtual Student Cluster Competition of the Supercomputing Conference series. Undeterred by the change in format, the students exhibited mastery of both HPC and cloud skills while building virtual clusters, learning scientific applications, and applying optimization techniques for chosen cloud configurations.
As part of the competition’s new parameters, each team received an initial $3,200 debit balance for the use of cloud resources. Benchmark results were then compared to calculate standings followed by a $500 boost 12 hours before the competition’s end which presented new opportunities for teams looking to maximize their respective scores. In total, all 19 teams used a collective $61,300 of the $70,300 budget, demonstrating not only effective HPC skills but also effective managerial and budgeting skills as well.
“Team Phoenix was supportive of one-another, competitive, clever, resourceful, and focused. It was a marvelous adventure. The end result is something all Yellow Jackets can be proud of and the team itself will never forget. We now have a reputation to defend and look forward to embarking on the adventure again in 2021,” said Powell.
IC Associate Professor Wins 2021 ACM-W Rising Star Award
School of Interactive Computing Associate Professor Munmun De Choudhury was named a winner of the 2021 ACM-W Rising Star Award.
The award, bestowed by the Association for Computing Machinery, recognizes a woman whose early-career research has had a significant impact on the computing discipline, as measured by factors like society impact, frequent citation of work, or creation of a new research area.
De Choudhury will receive a framed certificate and a $1,000 stipend for the recognition, which is in its first year of existence and will be given out annually. She will be recognized for the award at a research conference to be named later.
“I feel deeply honored for this recognition and owe my successes to my wonderful students and collaborators, as well as the intellectual freedom provided by Georgia Tech’s College of Computing that has helped trailblaze interdisciplinary research in computing, like mine, for years,” she said.
De Choudhury’s work leverages large-scale online social data and advances in machine learning to help answer fundamental questions relating to our social lives. Chief among them lie within the field of mental health care – understanding mental health, improving access to care, and more. Her work has been recognized by a number of other awards, including 13 best paper and honorable mention paper awards from the ACM and AAAI, as well as publications such as the New York Times, BBC, NPR, and others.
In addition to the personal appreciation, De Choudhury stressed the importance of recognizing the work of under-represented researchers in the computing field.
“I’d like to commend the efforts of ACM-W for creating this new opportunity to celebrate the research of a group under-represented in the computing field,” she said. “There is a long way to go when it comes to computing making significant positive impact on a pervasive societal problem like mental health. Still, this award serves as a valuable encouragement for the next frontier of my research program.”

IC Professors Howard, Goel Named 2021 AAAI Fellows
School of Interactive Computing Chair Ayanna Howard and Professor Ashok Goel were both named 2021 Fellows by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).
The AAAI Fellows program recognizes individuals who have made significant, sustained contributions – usually over at least a 10-year period – to the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
Goel’s research, which spans about 35 years, has connected fields of AI, cognitive science, and human cognition. Increasingly, it has merged the fields of AI and education, culminating in his lab’s groundbreaking work on Jill Watson, a virtual teaching assistant that can answer student questions in discussion forums for online classes. This trailblazing work has been recognized by numerous media outlets across the globe and has enormous long-term implications for the future of education.
“This is an exciting time for AI research into cognitive systems,” Goel said. “In one direction, my research uses the needs of human learning to ground and inspire novel AI techniques and tools. In the other, it uses AI theories and methods to provide new insights into human cognition and behavior.”
The team responsible for the advancement of Jill Watson and additional AI techniques for education, called emPrize, advanced to the semifinals of the international XPrize AI competition in 2020.
Howard, who was recently named the next Dean of Engineering at The Ohio State University, has performed similarly impactful research over her time in the field. As the director of the Human-Automation Systems Lab (HumAnS) at Georgia Tech, she has led research in conceptualizing humanized intelligence, the process of embedding human cognitive capability into the control path of autonomous systems.
Specifically, the lab studies how human-inspired techniques, such as soft computing methodologies, sensing, and learning can be used to enhance the autonomous capabilities of intelligent systems. This has impact in both virtual AI and robotics, and has led to enterprises like Zyrobotics, the company Howard co-founded that produces mobile therapy and educational products for children with differing needs.
Additionally, she has been a spokesperson for the importance of ethical research in the field.
“We’re at such a critical moment in the development of artificial intelligence,” Howard said. “There is incredible possibility, but equally daunting challenges. It’s an honor to be recognized for the work we are doing in this field, but it’s far from over. My hope is that I can inspire future researchers to pursue impactful and ethical advancements in the field.”
Eight others aside from Goel and Howard were also selected to the fellowship program for 2021 and will be recognized at the 2021 AAAI conference, being held virtually Feb. 2-9.
National Science Foundation Funds Three-Year Project to Study Gene Expression in Single Cells
Proteins play an essential role in determining structural components of body tissue, enzymes, and antibodies. Understanding how cells determine which proteins to produce is the key to preventing disease, cellular mutations, and more.
A gene must be first expressed before its protein product is produced. Now, with advancements in computational science, researchers are asking if we can computationally identify the mechanism which decides which genes express themselves in a cell.
The answer to this billion-dollar question lies in predicting genetic regulatory networks using large-scale single cell gene-expression data.
School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Assistant Professor Xiuwei Zhang is the recipient of a $400,000 National Science Foundation grant supporting the creation of new computing methods that aim to do just that.
“We know that if we detect expression for a gene then it is likely that its proteins are also present. Since experimentally measuring protein abundance in cells is very difficult, researchers look to gene regulatory networks to understand which proteins are present instead,” she said.
A gene regulatory network is a directing graph that shows out of tens of thousands of genes, which genes are controlling other genes.
“A common theory people use about molecular biology is that one gene corresponds to one mRNA and then corresponds to one protein. And most of the existing work to learn the gene regulatory networks also use this theory. However, this theory is over-simplified, and the fact is that one gene can correspond to multiple mRNAs, thus multiple proteins,” said Zhang.
This is where Zhang’s research breaks from traditional approaches and considers this one-to-many relationship in its gene regulatory networks.
“Now since one gene corresponds to multiple isoforms, in our gene regulatory networks, the nodes are isoforms instead of genes, which can provide a more accurate representation of the actual regulatory mechanism in cells,” she said.
According to Zhang, recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing technology have introduced new opportunities to infer high-quality regulatory networks at this level, but also pose new computational challenges.
In response to these challenges, a method for developing a transcript assembler that can quantify the expression level of an isoform is needed to build an accurate and scalable regulatory network. This part of the work is led by Zhang’s collaborator, Pennsylvania State University Assistant Professor Mingfu Shao.
Another challenge for the researchers to access network accuracy has to do with cell ordering. Depending on the level of error, cell ordering will determine whether a regulatory network’s predictions are accurate. To ensure this new network’s predictions are correct, Zhang has the robust goal to create a method that can perform cell ordering and network inference simultaneously.
Ultimately, the new methods will be used in the field of immunology to study cellular mechanisms in steroid-producing cells with collaborators at Cambridge University.
“This is very important for many biological events such as if disease happens during embryo development or to the immune system. It is our goal to be able to see from data that the level of an expression of a certain gene is not normal and then trace the problem through the regulator network. Once this is done, we can begin targeting the upstream genes for drug or vaccine development,” said Zhang.
Finding a New Future with OMSCS
For many Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) students, the program is a chance to get promoted within their current computing career or broaden their knowledge. But for others, it’s the door to an entirely new career path. From psychology to economics, students of all backgrounds can thrive in the program.
Finding CS
For many students, discovering a passion for CS was more serendipitous than planned. Goda Tarcijonas was managing a psychiatry research lab where her work was half clinical and half computational, and though she expected to prefer the clinical, the opposite happened.
“The days I coded for eight hours were the days I looked forward to the most, and I thought this is worth exploring,” she said.
Shijie Shi similarly found herself using data analysis in her role as an assistant director for Vanderbilt University’s Graduate Program in Economic Development. Although she came from an economics background, she would code in the data workshops she taught master’s students.
“I liked using code to solve problems, and using a program to analyze the data and see the story this data can tell,” she said.
Building skills
Students need to have demonstrated success in undergraduate-level CS courses to be accepted into OMSCS. Yet many prospective students start taking those classes when they discover their passion for CS.
After enjoying coding, Tarcijonas enrolled in undergraduate CS classes at University of Pittsburgh and a nearby community college. While searching for boot camps, she found OMSCS.
“I thought, ‘This really seems too good to be true! What’s the catch?’ This is an affordable amount of money, and it’s an amazing school,” she said.
Tarcijonas applied to OMSCS in 2018. She started the program Spring 2019 and has enjoyed combining her psychology background with computing in the Interactive Intelligence track.
“I’m sure I have to put in more work than someone who already has a CS background, but it’s definitely not impossible to do OMSCS if you’re motivated,” Tarcijonas said.
Shi also decided to pursue her passion for data and completed a datamining certificate at Stanford University.
“From that program, I really started seriously thinking about doing a CS graduate program because it’s my passion even if the homework sometimes takes me a little longer,” she said.
Shi found OMSCS while searching for online degrees and applied in 2015 to start in 2016. She focused on machine learning because it combined her math and economics background with CS.
Discovering new paths
Through OMSCS, Tarcijonas attended the 2019 Grace Hopper Celebration, where she got an internship at Docusign that turned into a full-time position as software engineer. She knows without OMSCS she wouldn’t have been able to make this career shift.
Shi now works at the World Bank as a financial analyst, a role she wouldn’t have been hired for without OMSCS. She was first brought on as a consultant because her computing background enabled her to revamp the organization’s data systems.
“I wanted to work for an international organization that makes a difference,” Shi said. “The reason I can work there is because of OMSCS.”

CS Majors Helping Automate a Safe Return to In-person Work and School
A new automated tool that uses the latest Covid-19 health and safety research is on track to help organizations plan and implement a safe return to in-person work and school amid the pandemic.
Called Rotations, the web-based platform was selected on Jan. 28 as the winning concept for Hack Covid-19, a student hackathon organized by Emory Global Health Institute and Georgia Tech. The winning team includes two Georgia Tech computer science (CS) majors.
Rotations is an automated schedule generator that helps mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in shared workspaces. According to its developers, the tool uses current health and safety data to auto-generate schedules, as well as suggested seating layouts, optimized to keep returning in-person employees and students safe.
“We put ourselves in the place of an office manager or school administrator and asked, ‘What kind of tool could make returning to in-person functions as easy as possible and how could we minimize the spread of the virus as much as possible at the same time?’” said Arvin Poddar, Rotations team member and third-year Georgia Tech CS major.
The schedules and seating charts output by the platform are customizable based on variables unique to a particular workspace. These can include a maximum number of people, the square footage of a room, ventilation, and other factors. These data points are also used to calculate a safety score that integrates available research resources.
“We are trying to change the game by looking at the research and seeing how floor layouts can truly be optimized with data,” said Merissa Coleman, team member and a third-year human health major from Emory University.
[NEWS RELEASE: Returning to a "New Normal"]
Another feature that helps mitigate the spread of the virus is the platform’s ability to automatically stagger arrival times for in-person employees. This helps to minimize contact and ensure proper social distancing. If someone does report contracting Covid-19, the platform has a contact tracing function that will automatically alert all of those that were in recent contact with that person.
“We wanted the product to be applicable to both management and employees. So, along with being easy to use, we wanted to be able to give peace of mind to those returning to the office and the classroom,” said Coleman.
As the winners of the Hack Covid-19 competition, Coleman, Poddar, and teammate Ryan Cobelli – also a Georgia Tech CS major – receive a $3,500 cash prize and earn a spot in the CREATE-X Startup Launch program this summer. CREATE-X is Georgia Tech’s entrepreneurial accelerator for students that helps develop projects like Rotations into business startups.
“As we know, Covid is changing every day and the situation is evolving. So, we are really looking forward to developing this product into something that people can really use,” said Poddar.
A primary feature that the team would like to develop while participating in the Startup Launch program is the direct integration of the Rotations tool. Being able to directly connect with systems that schools and businesses already use will do away with the current need for administrators to manually upload .csv files to develop rosters.
Beyond this, Poddar sees potential for even more integration with existing systems.
“Ultimately, maybe Rotations doesn’t even need to be its own stand-alone platform. Maybe it could be directly integrated into an existing HR system or learning management platform,” said Poddar.
LucyLabs Gives OMSCS Students Research Experience
OMSCS leads not just in online education but research in the area, and students are at the forefront of it.
After OMSCS launched in 2014, online education data only grew by the year but wasn’t being analyzed. Sensing a research avenue, OMSCS Executive Director David Joyner founded LucyLabs in 2016 to meet the growing demand for online education studies and give the program’s students the ability to engage in academic research.
“OMSCS students are incredibly well-qualified and passionate and have great ideas, but lack spare time to pursue the great ideas they already have,” said Joyner.
In LucyLabs, students and instructors work on the most compelling educational technology problems and can publish their research. This enables students to learn research skills with the benefit of professional guidance and course credit.
“Being given the opportunity to perform substantive research work has been a very important part of my OMSCS experience, as working through the process from design through IRB approvals and authoring of conference papers is unfortunately not part of the typical OMSCS course work,” said OMSCS student Ellie Shivers.
A computer science degree is ideal for pursuing online research because many companies are working with similar parameters, such as asynchronous communication and a shared project management channel. This makes the chance for research collaborations with companies and students across the university easier.
Since its founding, LucyLabs has published 47 papers on everything from automatically giving grades and feedback on open-ended assessments in support of rapid revision to examining the myriad challenges with leveraging online learning in Nigeria. Of those 47 papers, 21 have been co-authored by students and 15 have had a student as the primary author, including recipients of the best paper award at the Learning with MOOCs and Learning @ Scale conferences.
Ultimately, LucyLabs is about letting students see the real-world impact of their research. Shivers is currently evaluating the effectiveness of at scale continuing medical education course material surrounding the transgender/nonbinary community from a social perspective.
“I am passionate about social research around marginalized communities as it relates to healthcare technology, particularly with the ever-growing focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare,” Shivers said. “I love being afforded the opportunity to perform research that I hope may one day have tangible value in the day to day lives of people by improving patient outcomes in various capacities.”
Ph.D. Student Earns 2021 Focus Fellowship from Georgia Tech's Office of Minority Educational Development
School of Interactive Computing (IC) Ph.D. student Kantwon Rogers was awarded a 2021 Focus Fellowship by Georgia Tech’s Office of Minority Educational Development (OMED).
The award recognizes participants in the Focus Program who have demonstrated academic excellence, community leadership, and been granted admittance to a graduate program. The Focus Program aims to introduce minority students to graduate school in hopes of increasing the number who pursue higher degrees.
Rogers attended the Focus Program five years ago as an undergraduate student at Georgia Tech.
“It helped me learn about grad school and set me up for success,” Rogers said of the program.
The award, which carries a prize of up to $2,500 per student based on funds available and number of awardees, is not based on specific research but recognizes overall accomplishments. In an application essay, Rogers shared how OMED was pivotal to is success at Georgia Tech.
As an undergraduate, he participated in the Challenge Program, a five-week academic residential program for incoming first-year students. Later, he became a counselor in the same program, an OMED tutor, a Focus participant, a Focus panelist, and last summer a computer science (CS) instructor in the Challenge program.
“It was really spooky because I was teaching the new Challenge students in the exact same room that I sat in when I was learning CS for the first time in Challenge a decade ago,” Rogers said. “Truly full circle. OMED has truly been a foundation for me here at Georgia Tech, and I am eternally grateful.”
Rogers’ research focuses on human-robot interaction, investigating the effects that intelligent agent verbal deception has on human interaction.
“Animals deceive. Humans deceive. Should robots and AI deceive?” Rogers poses in his research tagline.
Additionally, the work aims to provide AI systems the ability to autonomously produce contextually meaningful and successfully deceptive utterances while determining when it is appropriate to verbally deceive humans.
He is advised by IC Chair Ayanna Howard.
College Advisory Board Chair Named Businesswoman of the Year
A key member of the Georgia Tech College of Computing community has earned some well-deserved recognition from her hometown business community.
Beverly Seay, chair of the College’s Advisory Board, has been named as the 2021 Businesswoman of the Year by the Orlando Business Journal. Seay was also recently selected for the publication’s 2021 Women Who Mean Business list.
“This is a well-deserved recognition. Bev is a tireless advocate, not only for the College of Computing but also for the other institutions and organizations—and the people in them—she serves. She is someone I respect and admire very much,” said Charles Isbell, Georgia Tech dean of computing and John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
Seay has been a part of the central Florida business community for more than 25 years. A recognized leader in the modeling and simulation community, she is known for her innovative approaches to systems engineering, modeling and simulation, and for developing composable systems that allow datacenters to use software and hardware resources more efficiently.
Along with serving as chair of the College of Computing Advisory Board, Seay also serves on the Georgia Tech Capital Campaign Steering Committee. She is also chair of the University of Central Florida Board of Trustees.

New Chapter Aims to Increase Equity in High Performance Computing
Georgia Tech’s high-performance computing (HPC) mission is expanding with its latest initiative: The launch of its very own Women in High Performance Computing (WHPC) chapter.
From observing binary black holes to synthesizing all of the work in the largest publication journal, HPC processes the world’s data and attempts to answer science’s largest problems. Despite this field’s rapid growth and acute use in problem solving, the gap in representation for those in the community remains apparent. This is why WHPC’s international mission to enhance equity, inclusion, and access for women and minorities to the field of HPC is so critical.
Currently, Georgia Tech awards more engineering degrees to women than any other institution in the country. As HPC represents the intersection of engineering and computing, carrying forward the WHPC mission to promote, build, and leverage a diverse and inclusive HPC community is a natural next step for Georgia Tech.
This next step is also complemented by several high-profile initiatives launched over the past few years including the unveiling of a $5.3 million HPC system known as the Hive supercomputer.
“Our geography and history provide a unique context for engaging in diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts given the racial and ethnic diversity of our broader community around Georgia Tech,” said Lorna Rivera, research scientist and founding WHPC member.
The Georgia Tech chapter’s primary goal is to provide a platform for all HPC researchers – regardless of gender, area of study, and level of expertise. The chapter’s main drivers for this goal include:
- Helping students toward HPC professional career paths
- Providing classroom HPC resources for teachers
- Offering HPC consulting to teachers
- Involving industry partners on real-world projects
The chapter aims to achieve these goals by engaging researchers from across academic institutions including Georgia Tech, Atlanta’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities, minority-serving institutions, and others interested in learning more or providing support for HPC research.
“We believe that by increasing exposure as well as access to resources for teaching through student-run seminars, workshops, online classes offered by GT’s Partnership for an Advanced Computing Environment (PACE), and mentorship efforts, we can build a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive supercomputing community,” said Neil Bright, PACE Associate Director of Research Cyberinfrastructure.
The WHPC will host a public event to celebrate its launch on March 26 from 2-3 p.m. EST.
The event will feature some of HPC’s heavy hitters from across the country. This list includes high-profile speakers experienced in navigating the world of HPC, passionate about building equity in this arena, and enthusiastic about sharing their professional journey.

Professor Wins Intel Outstanding Researcher Award
Professor Moinuddin Qureshi received Intel’s 2020 Outstanding Researcher Award in February. He is one of 18 researchers who won this award for their work in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and other emerging innovative technologies.
“It is a great honor to receive this award,” Qureshi said. “I have always enjoyed collaborating with Intel, right from my younger days of summer internships till now. Intel has a great set of researchers and you get feedback that keeps the research practical and useful.”
Qureshi was recognized for designing efficient and robust hybrid memory architectures. These memory systems combine conventional DRAM memory modules with emerging memory technologies such as non-volatile memory (NVM) and high-bandwidth memory (HBM).
In hybrid memory systems, the placement of data can determine performance and energy efficiency. Ideally, frequently accessed data is placed in the low-latency high-bandwidth memory, and the remaining data in high-capacity low-cost memory.
Qureshi’s group has developed innovative designs such as Alloy Cache, which outperforms combines the tag and data together to do the cache lookup in single access and outperforms most designs.
His group has also developed low-cost set-associative DRAM caches (called ACCORD), which maintain the low-latency of direct-mapped caches while providing conflict-miss reduction of set-associative caches. His group is currently investigating low-cost compression designs that are suitable for large giga-scale memory systems while limiting the performance degradation from metadata lookups.
Intel has supported Qureshi’s group in developing hybrid memory designs for more than five years. This research has produced several publications at flagship architecture conferences, such as the International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) and International Symposium on Microarchitecture. The grant has supported the Ph.D. dissertations of three graduate students.
“Intel is one of the few companies that has an accessible funding model focused on fostering academic research,” Qureshi said. “I am thankful to Intel for the continued support and look forward to the collaboration.”
This is Qureshi’s second Intel award. He first won the inaugural Intel Early Career Faculty Honor Award in 2012.
Qureshi leads the Memory Systems Lab at Georgia Tech. His research group looks at a variety of topics ranging from quantum computing to hardware security to robust artificial intelligence algorithms to designing future memory systems.
Computing Ranks Well for Gender Diversity Says Industry Report
A recent industry report finds that Georgia Tech is doing comparatively well when it comes to the gender diversity of its computer science (CS) faculty.
The report from CrowdStrike, a global cybersecurity company, says that Georgia Tech ranks second in the U.S. for gender diversity among CS faculty. According to the report, women comprise 23.8 percent of the CS faculty at Georgia Tech.
“Pushing forward on gender equity is a top strategic driver for the College and the Institute so I’m pleased that we have ranked well in this report. There is still much to be done, but this is solid evidence that our efforts to even the playing field are paying off, and that we are moving in the right direction,” said Charles Isbell, Georgia Tech dean of computing and John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
In the report, Duke University ranks first with women making up 27.4 percent of its CS faculty. Harvard University ranks third with 23.7 percent female CS faculty. The U.S. average is 18.7 percent.
The analysis examined faculty listings on websites for the top 25 CS schools as ranked in U.S. News and World Report’s 2018 graduate program rankings. It included data for professors, instructors, and researchers, but does not include staff members.
The reasons for bringing attention to gender diversity in computer science are clear. The CrowdStrike report references data from a recent Microsoft survey that showed that women are 52 percent more likely to stay in STEM fields if they have a female role model.
According to the report, “The fewer female computer science academics there are, the less likely female students are to continue to study computer sciences, graduate with a computer sciences degree and go on to inspire other females to do so.”
“I’m exceedingly proud of our female faculty members. The mentorship, leadership, and guidance they provide, and the example they set, are vitally important to the ongoing success of our female students at every level,” said Isbell.
Along with this encouraging news about faculty gender diversity, the College is also seeing positive growth in female student enrollments.
Nationally, 18 percent of undergraduate CS majors are women. According to enrollment data, 27 percent of CS majors at Georgia Tech are women. The percentage of female CS Ph.D. students nationally is 21 percent, while at Tech 24 percent of CS Ph.D. students are female.
Overall, total female enrollment in B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. programs, has grown from 16 percent of GT Computing students a decade ago to 21 percent today. This equates to 31 percent growth in female enrollment in the College over the past decade.
CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Georgia Tech College of Computing alumnus.
CS Major Earns Adobe Research Women-In-Tech Scholarship
As far back as she can remember in her academic journey, Prerna Ravi has faced gender bias.
“I had to work doubly hard to prove myself and prove to others that we young girls are second to none when it comes to applying logic, rationale, and computing skills in STEM-related projects.”
Her determination and hard work are serving Ravi well. She’s a third-year computer science major at Georgia Tech and now, she is the recent recipient of a 2021 Adobe Research Women-in-Technology Scholarship.
“This scholarship gives me a splendid opportunity to represent women in technology and strive toward Adobe’s lofty goals of including gender diversity while pursuing my research goals,” said Ravi.
As a 2021 Adobe Research Women-in-Technology Scholar, Ravi will receive $10,000 for educational expenses, a yearlong Adobe Creative Cloud subscription, and a chance to interview for an internship with Adobe.“More than anything else, this recognition means a lot to me and it is indeed a life-changing moment since it has instilled a greater sense of responsibility and confidence in me to pursue my ambition for leveraging technology in the field of education,” said Ravi.
Ravi is the head teaching assistant (TA) for Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (CS 1331). She’s taken on the role to “give back to the community” in appreciation for the mentorship that she has received from previous TAs.
Along with being a TA, Ravi is also an undergraduate researcher. Her interests include applying technology in the field of education, particularly within underrepresented contexts.
She is currently working with School of Interactive Computing (IC) Professor Thad Starner and Georgia Tech’s Contextual Computing Lab to develop an American Sign Language recognition game. Once it’s complete, this game will help deaf children communicate with their hearing parents.
“I also recently conducted an ethnographic study with School of IC Assistant Professor Neha Kumar at the Technology and Design for Empowerment on the Margins (TanDEm) lab. I investigated the transition to online learning within the Indian education system under resource-constrained environments during COVID-19,” said Ravi.
With this type of mentorship and support, Ravi says she’s been inspired and able to overcome academic challenges by relating them to real-world experiences.
“The teaching faculty has constantly encouraged me to go beyond my comfort zone and excel in various challenging situations. Georgia Tech is where I have developed my life skills and these will stay with me long after graduation,” said Ravi.
Assistant Professor Earns 2020 Salesforce AI Research Grant
School of Interactive Computing Assistant Professor Diyi Yang was named a Salesforce AI Research Grant Winner for 2020. One of seven winners of the award, she will receive a $50,000 grant to advance her work. It is the third year the grant has been provided by Salesforce.
Yang’s research, which is being led by her Ph.D. student Jiaao Chen, aims to alleviate dependence of supervised models on labeled data via data augmentation approaches. Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example pairs, inferring the function from training data that has been tagged with identifying properties or characteristics (labeled data).
The hope is that they may improve upon the ability to transfer models from one setting to another despite the relative lack of intensive training examples.
“In the era of deep learning, natural language processing (NLP) has achieved extremely good performances in most data-intensive settings,” Yang said. “However, when there are only one or a few training examples, supervised deep learning models often fail. This strong dependence on labeled data largely prevents neural network models from being applied to new settings or real-world situations.”
Yang’s group has published a couple of papers in this field already, and she said the Salesforce grant will further support efforts to extend it to broader contexts, especially when NLP tasks involve complicated outputs.
“These examples might include performing named entity recognition that finds the important information in a text, or semantic parsing that converts a natural language sentence into a structured command,” she said.
You can read previous papers on the subject at the links below:
- MixText: Linguistically-Informed Interpolation of Hidden Space for Semi-Supervised Text Classification (Jiaao Chen, Zichao Yang, Diyi Yang)
- Local Additivity Based Data Augmentation for Semi-supervised NER (Jiaao Chen, Zhenghui Wang, Ran Tian, Zichao Yang, Diyi Yang)
Yang was chosen from a group of over 180 quality proposals from more than 30 countries.

According to Park, “I am honored and humbled to become an ACM fellow. I thank all my students and collaborators who made it possible.”
Aluru is being recognized by ACM for research contributions to parallel methods in computational biology and leadership in data science. From sponsoring the annual ACM SIGBio Diversity and Inclusiveness Panel to leading initiatives to increase equity for underrepresented groups, Aluru’s years of work have made major contributions to enhancing the field of data science for all.
“I remember joining ACM as a student member in 1992, having little idea how important it is for professional growth and service,” said Aluru.
“Since 2015, I had the opportunity to lead computational biology activities of ACM as Chair of its Special Interest Group in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Biomedical Informatics (SIGBio). It is delightful to have ACM formally recognize my research contributions in this area and leadership in data science,” he said.
What makes this all the more impressive is that this recognition marks the third major fellow title for both Park and Aluru who are also IEEE and Society for Industrial and Implied Mathematics Fellows.

“Furthermore, Srinivas is also a fellow of the American Association for Advancement of Science (AAAS) – an extremely impressive record! His record also represents the power of CSE as a foundation for many disciplines,” said Park.
CSE Student Awarded Fellowship to Enhance AI in Fintech Transparency
Haekyu Park is a School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Ph.D. student aiming to create new methods that break down the black box of artificial intelligence (AI) for users.
Now, her human-centered approach to increase machine learning interpretability is set to be applied to the financial tech sector with a newly awarded 2021 JPMorgan Chase AI Research Ph.D. Fellowship.
According to Park, “Society faces fundamental barriers to learning, understanding, and ultimately trusting AI technologies.”
“Not only does a lack of transparency make people hesitant to trust and deploy them, when AI models do not perform satisfactorily or are harmed by malicious attacks, people lack actionable guidance for understanding their vulnerabilities and how to fix them,” she said.
This is where Park’s research in creating interactive visualization tools for machine learning models can help address some of the significant challenges seen across the fintech industry.
Specifically, the fellowship program aims to apply innovative AI and data science tools to support financial businesses. This support ranges from securing AI for privacy, cryptography in financial services, safe human-AI interaction, and more.
There are many use cases for how this research could be applied by a JPMorgan Chase customer. This includes providing explanations as to how an AI service makes a decision. With this, stakeholders can better understand, for example, if an algorithm is adequately capturing their needs or assessing their risk tolerance.
“In the risk management case, I could help a customer understand which features are considered most for the AI decision. For example, there could be many factors that decide that risk, but we can detail which features are higher priority than others and help a customer visualize their data by understanding how key factors are correlated or weighted,” she said.
Park continued, “Through my research in information visualization, machine learning, and data analytics over the past few years, I have realized that the key to promote trust in AI and protect the models is to bring humans into the loop.”
Since beginning her graduate research three years ago, Park has worked with advisor and CSE Associate Professor Polo Chau and Interactive Computing Assistant Professor Diyi Yang to create similar methods with that specific goal in mind.
Currently, the team is designing a visual user interface where users, such as AI experts, can quickly view and edit an AI model’s weakened area.
“Some models can be attacked,” explained Park. “So, what we want to do is help users easily identify and fix the model – which usually takes a considerable amount of time.”
While the audience of Park’s fellowship research may not include AI experts, the fundamental need to enhance AI model’s interpretability in a timely manner is the same.
Deans Husbands Fealing, Isbell Elected to American Academy of Arts and Sciences
Two of Georgia Tech’s deans have been elected to the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Sciences. On April 22, the academy announced that Kaye Husbands Fealing, dean and Ivan Allen Jr. Chair of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay Jr. Chair of the College of Computing, are part of the 2021 class of New Fellows and International Honorary Members. Susan Lozier, dean and Betsy Middleton and John Clark Sutherland Chair of the College of Sciences, was elected to the 2020 class, making three of the Institute’s eight deans members of the academy.
Dean Husbands Fealing was named to the list of those in Leadership, Policy, and Communications under Public Affairs and Public Policy. Dean Isbell was named to the list of those in Mathematical and Physical Sciences in the Computer Sciences category. They are part of a class of 252 new members. The academy was established in 1780 by U.S. founding leaders who believed the new republic should honor exceptionally accomplished individuals and engage them in advancing the public good.
“We are fortunate to have some of the world’s most outstanding faculty at Georgia Tech, leaders who are also developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition,” said Steve McLaughlin, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs. “I congratulate Dean Husbands Fealing and Dean Isbell as they join the honorary society and also work with other national and global leaders across disciplines to address significant challenges.”
Husbands Fealing said, “I am grateful to be recognized for work in the areas of public affairs and public policy. Working on decision-making foundations and implementation strategies in science, technology, and innovation policy has been rewarding, especially when we are able to see science in service of communities. I appreciate the support of my colleagues at Georgia Tech, and I look forward to advancing scientific collaboration and expanding access to STEM research for future generations of students, particularly those of diverse backgrounds.”
Isbell said he is honored and humbled to be named as a member and “thankful for all the opportunities I have been afforded going all the way back to my undergrad days here at Tech. I will make sure to take this election as another opportunity, and do my best to pay it forward.”
The artists, scholars, scientists, and leaders in the public, nonprofit, and private sectors elected this year include neurosurgeon and medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta of CNN and Emory University, and media entrepreneur and philanthropist Oprah Winfrey of Harpo Inc. and Oprah Winfrey Network.
“We are honoring the excellence of these individuals, celebrating what they have achieved so far, and imagining what they will continue to accomplish,” said David Oxtoby, president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. “The past year has been replete with evidence of how things can get worse; this is an opportunity to illuminate the importance of art, ideas, knowledge, and leadership that can make a better world.”

New Mural Illustrates the Power of Innovation and Community
Not only is Startup Exchange – Georgia Tech’s student-led entrepreneurial community – inspiring new business ventures, it’s also inspiring new works of art.
A mural celebrating the power of innovation and community was unveiled earlier this month at the Tech Square Atlanta Social Club (TSQATL) on Spring Street in Midtown Atlanta. The 21 x 15-foot painting is a collaboration between Startup Exchange and TSQATL and is intended to visually represent the shared mission of both groups.
Second-year Computational Media student Shruti Vedula was the driving force behind the mural titled, The Symphony of Innovation. She serves as marketing director for Startup Exchange and worked with her team members to develop the mural concept.
“I hope that when people see the mural, they feel the depth of the colors, the power of each symbol, and the balance of shapes and styles that make up the mural,” Vedula said.
“I also hope that people appreciate the power of art and design when they see this mural because, in such a technologically driven world, it is art and design that gives relief to the eye and allows us to connect to the world around us in a deeper way.”
The mural is sectioned into six monochromatic sections. With the Startup Exchange logo leading off in the upper left corner of the piece, each of the group’s five focus areas – logistics, marketing, growth, partnerships, and fellowship – is highlighted.
More information about the mural and the symbolism found in each of the sections is available in this article.
This New Tool Can Track the Environmental Cost of Your Machine Learning Model
Energy consumption is a major factor to plan for when implementing a long-term project or service that uses large-scale machine learning algorithms.
Now, a team of researchers from Georgia Tech has created an interactive tool called EnergyVis that allows users to compare energy consumption across locations and against other models.
EnergyVis helps users answer three critical questions:
- What is the environmental cost to train or run this algorithm?
- How does this algorithm compare to others in terms of cost?
- Can a team in a different location run this algorithm for the same cost?
“Sometimes, training machine learning models from end-to-end takes the same amount of energy as a transatlantic flight. Is every organization using machine learning able to budget for such an expense? What if the grid in which a business runs is running on coal versus green energy?” said Omar Shaikh, a computer science undergraduate student.
Shaikh is helping lead the research for this interactive dashboard along with M.S. student Jon Saad-Falcon, Ph.D students Austin P. Wright, Nilaksh Das, Scott Freitas, and faculty advisors School of Public Policy Assistant Professor Omar Asensio and School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Associate Professor Polo Chau.
According to Shaikh, prior research that aims to track energy consumption is already available. However, EnergyVis distinguishes itself by offering a more visually appealing dashboard and easier user experience to enable energy tracking and energy usage comparisons across models and across scenarios.
“A common counterargument for why we should track model energy consumption is that models don’t use as much energy as many other things comparatively – so, what’s the point?” he said. “The point of EnergyVis is that it not only tracks their energy usage, but it also keeps people accountable for how much energy they are using.”
Another utility of the new dashboard is that it allows for better reproducibility for researchers working in different locations. With the ability to budget and better determine energy usage, teams are better able to plan where a deployment may or may not be cost effective or environmentally friendly.
“If you’re training your model in a state that largely uses coal-burning energy sources, your CO2 output for the electricity your model is using is going to be much higher than if you were to train or use your model in an area using green energy,” said Shaikh.
While this new visualization tool is in its initial phases, Shaikh says that the research team would like to consider plans to expand and generalize EnergyVis for any computing-intensive task.

CSE Faculty Member Recognized for Contributions to Computational Science
School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Associate Professor Edmond Chow has been named as one of 28 new Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Fellows for 2021.
SIAM represents an international community of over 14,000 members and is considered the leading professional organization for computational and applied mathematicians in industry and academia.
This SIAM recognition highlights Chow’s contributions to the field of computational science and engineering within the areas of numerical linear algebra and high-performance computing (HPC).
Specifically, Chow’s research aims to develop numerical methods that are specialized for HPC computers used to solve large-scale scientific computing problems such as those found in quantum chemistry.
“My students and I search for new, efficient ways to computationally solve the mathematical models that we use to model the world around us,” he said.
“We also implement the methods in open software so that they can be easily used by others. In recent years, we've been working particularly with quantum chemists, who have a rich source of numerical and other computational problems.”
While he remains active in external roles, such as serving as deputy chair on the ACM Gordon Bell Prize Committee and as associate editor for ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, Chow says one of his goals is to build a stronger community around scientific computing, particularly at Georgia Tech. He is currently facilitating this goal by serving as co-chair of the 2022 SIAM Annual Meeting and by organizing the Georgia Scientific Computing Symposium in February 2022.
The Georgia Scientific Computing Symposium offers a forum for students and faculty from across the state of Georgia to gather and share recent advances in all aspects of scientific computing. Notably, the one-day symposium will be hosted by CSE at Georgia Tech in 2022.
“It has been very heart-warming to receive so many congratulatory messages from literally around the world in the past few days. I'm lucky to be working in a very supportive community,” he said.
Survey Says CS Majors Have Highest Median Starting Salary at Tech
As a Dacula High School senior, Sabrina Seibel says that computer science (CS) just didn’t click for her.
But with an established reputation for pushing herself – she was the kicker for her high school’s varsity football team – Seibel says she decided to pursue CS anyway “because I felt it really challenged me.”
Last week, she earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree from Georgia Tech.
Seibel credits her ultimate success to the resources that the College of Computing provides to students. Taking advantage of tutoring, teaching assistants, career services programs, and entrepreneurial opportunities, she says one day everything finally “clicked.”
“The College of Computing gives its students a strong technical background and comprehensive education that set me up for success,” said Seibel (BS CS 21).
Other new alumni echoed this sentiment. “Being a student in the College of Computing allowed me to learn not only the foundations of computer science but also how to apply them,” said Joshua Suber (BS CM 21). Having just earned a bachelor’s degree in computational media, Suber is heading to Carnegie Mellon University to work on a master’s degree in human-computer interaction (HCI).
Like Suber, several new alumni from the class of 2021 are moving on to graduate programs at Georgia Tech, Cornell University, Stanford University, and other institutions.
Most, however, including Seibel, have accepted jobs with Fortune 500 firms and other leading tech companies. According to a recent survey, the median starting salary for Georgia Tech students graduating with an undergraduate CS degree is just shy of $101,000.
At $100,981 – up from $93,000 in Spring 2016 – CS currently has the highest median starting salary of all majors at Georgia Tech.
The findings are from the Georgia Tech Career and Salary Survey for 2019-2020, which is the latest information available. The survey indicates that more than 89 percent of responding Georgia Tech graduating CS majors had job offers, while 87 percent had accepted positions. The median starting bonus for new Georgia Tech CS grads is $15,750.
Seibel has accepted a job offer from Google. Google is one of the top companies hiring Georgia Tech CS graduates. This year, Amazon, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, NCR, and Salesforce all hired more than one new CS alumni, mostly as software designers or software engineers.
Seibel is joining Google’s Experiments Infrastructure team in New York City as a software engineer. Part of her job on the team – which is in charge of the rollout and analytics for new features being added to products like Gmail and Google Drive – will be to identify and fix issues before they make it to the company’s customers.
Although a job search can be intimidating, Seibel says that the college started helping her to prepare as far back as her first year at Tech. With an active corporate affiliates program boasting dozens of top high-tech companies and organizations, and two College career fairs each year, Seibel had lots of opportunities to meet directly with recruiters.
“Given these experiences, I quickly became accustomed to what would’ve been high-pressure situations and became comfortable in interviews and eventually, in industry,” said Seibel.
Anna Bonatz (BS CS 21) also attributes her success on the job market to the College’s career services programs.
“I decided to schedule some mock interviews and sessions to talk about perfecting my interviewing and networking skills. This ultimately helped me land my job at Deloitte as it prepped me early for the multiple interviews and case studies that I had to complete,” said Bonatz, who is starting at Deloitte as a consultant.
She added, “My time in the College of Computing has been challenging but immensely rewarding. Every person I have met has pushed me to be my best and learn as much as I can while finding the joy and creativity within computing.”
New Endowed Chair Honors Inclusion and Diversity
More than 100 individual donors have come together to endow the Zvi Galil PEACE Chair in the College of Computing. The future holder of the chair will be tasked with ensuring that Georgia Tech’s computing programs are accessible, equitable, and diverse.
The chair is named in honor of former John P. Imlay Jr. Chair and dean, Zvi Galil, who served in this capacity in the College of Computing from 2010 to 2019. Under his leadership, the College saw significant growth in enrollment at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. He led the creation, launch, and the first five years of the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program.
Galil, who was born in Tel Aviv in 1947, earned a bachelor’s and a master’s in applied mathematics from Tel Aviv University before earning a Ph.D. in computer science from Cornell University in 1975. His storied career includes serving as chair of the computer science department at Tel Aviv University (1979 – 1982) and Columbia University (1989 – 1994), dean of The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (1995 – 2007), and president of Tel Aviv University (2007-09). Galil is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has written more than 200 scientific papers, edited five books, and lectured in 25 countries.

Despite such a compelling resume, Galil said OMSCS is “the biggest thing I’ve done in my life,” pointing to the program’s national and international popularity due to its high academic quality, accessibility, low cost, and flexible scheduling. “I am honored and thankful to be recognized and remembered for fulfilling the pledge of Progress and Service,” he added.
The Galil PEACE Chair is both a tribute to Galil’s legacy and a challenge to create increasingly diverse and equitable approaches to computing education.
PEACE stands for Pervasive Equitable Access for Computing Education. “Equitable access is central to the College’s mission and history,” said Charles Isbell (BS ICS 90), College of Computing dean and John P. Imlay Jr. Chair.
“We have the OMSCS program and the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing. We partner with CEISMC and CEED and other programs both inside and outside Georgia Tech,” Isbell said. “This chair holder will be central to the ongoing conversations about democratizing education, and as an advocate will ensure that our mission to work for equity and access in computing will continue to be a part of our future.”
OMSCS, a completely virtual graduate program in computer science, was designed to address issues of accessibility, and currently has just under 11,000 students from across the country and around the world.
“OMSCS is bringing a master’s program in computing to individuals who wouldn’t otherwise have the opportunity to pursue one,” said Reza Ghorieshi (BS CS 96), a member of the College of Computing Advisory Board.
Bev Seay, chair of the Board, led the fundraising effort as a means to honor Galil, bring computing education to underrepresented groups, and ensure the College continues to produce top-notch graduates.
“I don’t think any other university has an endowed chair like this that is devoted to access and equity in computing,” Seay said.
New NVIDIA Partnership Bridges Education Gap for Data Science and Machine Learning
As data science and machine learning needs surge across the globe, many educators and students are left behind due to a lack of availability and access to comprehensive learning materials. This is where NVIDIA and Georgia Tech’s latest partnership aims to help.
Developed by School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Associate Professor Polo Chau and Prairie View A&M University Assistant Professor Xishuang Dong, a teaching kit focused on data science education as part of the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) is now available for free to qualified educators.
Released as a multi-part series, four kits are offered through NVIDIA’s DLI program in collaboration with leading researchers and professors in four research areas:
- Deep Learning
- Accelerated Computing
- Robotics
- Data Science
Specifically, each of these four DLI Teaching Kits lowers the barrier to entry for educators seeking to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and graphic processing unit (GPU) computing in coursework by providing downloadable teaching materials and online courses.
The kit teaches students fundamental and advanced topics on accelerated data science with the NVIDIA RAPIDS framework, GPU-accelerated machine learning, data visualization, graph analytics, and more.
“Traditional data science software libraries are mainly written for CPUs and don’t take advantage of GPUs. The RAPIDS library is NVIDIA’s effort to simplify and more easily use their GPU Python focused library,” said Chau.
The Data Science Teaching Kit contains tens of modules and labs, with content adapted from the popular course, CSE 6242: Data and Visual Analytics, taught by Chau. Georgia Tech contributors on the project include Polo Club for Data Science researchers Scott Freitas, Haekyu Park, Jay Wang, Jon Saad-Falcon, Kevin Li, Aiswarya Bhagavatula, and Frank Zhou.
“The new development on our side is creating the modules and figuring out how to provide interactive labs for the students to work on and new coding questions,” said Freitas, a lead researcher on the project. “We also released three papers and each one of those papers will inform a lab in the teaching kit.”
Part of these papers include two new large-scale datasets for cybersecurity which are incorporated into the toolkit to teach participants how to detect malware using new graph techniques.
According to Freitas, the two datasets being integrated are also two of the largest cybersecurity and graph datasets ever released in the world.
“The end goal is to help people learn how to use new state-of-the-art GPU accelerated techniques. NVIDIA has many advanced technologies that they are developing but it may not necessarily be accessible to people just getting into the field. So, this teaching kit aims to take all of these components and simplify them in a way that is successful and easy to use for educators,” he said.
40 Under 40 List Spotlights Computing Alumni Contributions
Whether they are working in the public sector or the private sector, alumni from the College of Computing are changing the world for the better.
To recognize a few of their achievements, the Georgia Tech Alumni Association has named three College of Computing alumni to its class of 2021 40 Under 40 list. They are:
- Mahdi Al-Husseini (PP 18, BME 18, MS CS 20)
- Vanessa Larco (CS 08)
- Dhawal Shah (MS CS 10)
“What strikes me is that they are different people doing very different things. It is incredibly uplifting to see this diversity of talent, nurtured at Georgia Tech, using what they have learned to solve real-world challenges in ways that improve people's lives,” said Charles Isbell, College of Computing dean and the John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
Al-Husseini is an aeromedical evacuations officer in the U.S. Army who is currently stationed in Hawaii. In his current role, Al-Husseini draws on his experience in a variety of disciplines – embedded systems, artificial intelligence, and mechatronics – to advance the emergency care of wounded service personnel.
Larco is a partner with New Enterprise Associates, which is a venture capital and private equity company. Larco is also part of a group of investors that volunteers time each week to mentor entrepreneurs and founders from underrepresented communities.
Shah is the founder and CEO of Class Central. Prior to creating Class Central in December 2011, which he describes as a “TripAdvisor for Online Education,” Shah worked as a software engineer and developer.
More about Shah, Larco, and Al-Husseini is available in the full list for the class of 2021 40 Under 40.
Study Finds Phone Storage Prioritizes Developers Over Users
When a user downloads a new app, they probably use just a few features. In fact, according to a new study, people use only about 10 percent of each app.
School of Computer Science (SCS) alumnus Ashish Bijlani discovered this at the start of his Ph.D. when he tried to install an operating system update and was told he didn’t have enough space on his device.
“I don’t play a lot of games, take a lot of pictures, and have very few apps I installed myself, so I was shocked. I wanted to find out what was going on so I started to look into this,” he said.
Bijlani spent his Ph.D. studying phone storage consumption to confirm how much space apps were really taking up and how little users were actually engaging with them. His solution is to make context-specific storage that follows the behavior of the user.
Studying Storage
To determine how each app uses storage, Bijlani had to download the most popular apps and analyze their consumption. Downloading millions of apps to determine their storage size required a large distributed system. When Bijlani started the project in 2014, he downloaded 1.1 million apps; by 2016 the number was up to 2.2 million.
The team analyzed popular apps released in two-year intervals from 2014 to 2019. When an app becomes especially popular, it often turns into a super app with more features than its initial purpose. For example, Uber may have started as a ride-sharing app, but now offers food delivery and scooter rental.
“Developers add a lot of features so users stay engaged with the app because that’s how they monetize it,” Bijlani said. “But only a few users are going to use the majority of these features.”
Bijlani found that most users engage with just 10 percent of the app after conducting a user study with 140 participants from the University of Buffalo’s phone lab testbed, where researchers can deploy Android changes to participants’ phones and carry out studies.
Since these apps are optimized for performance, storage often gets ignored to the detriment of the user. For example, apps include residual files, such as logs on how users interact with ads, that never get cleaned up. There is no incentive for vendors to maximize storage because they can sell bigger phones or more cloud storage.
Proposing a Solution
The phone lab also showed that though most users take advantage of just 10 percent of the app, they’re not all using the same percentage. With gaming apps, for example, some users are content to play just the first few levels, whereas others play the game to completion.
Bijlani believes apps could be context-sensitive to users’ behavior in the same way they already track screen time and Bluetooth devices. With that in mind, he developed a lightweight storage-tracing tool, Cosmos, that collects traces of how users interact with apps to determine the best customized storage model. For example, if a user only opens the weather app in the morning, then future phones could offload it for the rest of the day.
He presented this research at ACM SIGMETRICS in June. Bijlani co-wrote the paper, Where did my 256 GB go? A Measurement Analysis of Storage Consumption on Smart Mobile Devices, with SCS Professor Umakishore Ramachandran, and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s Professor Roy Campbell.
New Open-source Tool Gives Cybersecurity Pros an Integrated Approach to Combat Malware
A new open-source cybersecurity technique called Forecast from the Georgia Institute of Technology is able to identify the capabilities that malware is planning to use in an attack before those capabilities are deployed. The all-in-one tool then predicts or ranks the likelihood of each possible staged attack – in less than five minutes on average.
The research effort provides a new cyber forensics method for incident responders who have discovered their network is under attack, one that can provide an edge in speed and resource allocation to combat the cyber threat.
“Currently, when there is a cyberattack, investigators have to painstakingly switch between multiple tools and piece together the puzzle by themselves,” said Brendan Saltaformaggio, faculty advisor on the work and assistant professor in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). “Incident responders must quickly get ahead of the attacker and understand what threats they will soon face in order to combat the cyberattack in real-time.”
Forecast essentially creates a criminal profile of the malware using a novel technique invented by researchers in the Georgia Tech CyFI Lab, directed by Saltaformaggio, that combines forensic and predictive modeling methods. That profile lets security responders know whether they should be looking for, say, an impending ransomware attack or another type of threat, like trying to steal private data or the deployment of new malicious code on the network.
In more than 6,700 tests, researchers demonstrated that Forecast can:
- Build a criminal profile of the malware’s future capabilities in approximately five minutes
- Accurately determine more than 4 out of 5 likely upcoming attack types
- Rank the order in which the attacks will occur with 95 percent accuracy
“Our technique gives incident responders the ability to predict or forecast what the malware is going to do next when it is detected,” said Omar Alrawi, lead researcher and Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). “It is basically catching the crime in action and inferring the intent of the criminal by using a scientific approach.”
The research team’s broad approach takes a memory image of the malware’s last known state and then uses predictive modeling to “animate” that forensic evidence into a possible branching path of attacks.
If it were a bank robbery, Forecast would take a photo of a bad guy collecting the tools he would use to crack a vault. Then it would create a series of possible paths the robber might take into the bank, to the vault, and to the escape car using a highly empirical process. Forecast can give authorities a list of which attacks to defend against and in what order to defend against or outright stop the attack.
The final output of Forecast is a report with evidence of the forecasted ways the malware might attack and in what order, making it easier for incident responders to weigh decisions in real-time.
“Incident responders are overwhelmed during an ongoing attack trying to find other infected systems to contain the malware from spreading. Forecast lessens the cognitive burden on responders by automating the process of cyber forensics by providing a simplified actionable report to the analyst and freeing up resources for other pressing tasks,” said Alrawi.
The research will be presented at the 30th Usenix Security Symposium taking place Aug. 11-13. The paper Forecasting Malware Capabilities From Cyber Attack Memory Images is co-authored by Alrawi, Moses Ike, Matthew Pruett, Ranjita Pai Kasturi, Srimanta Barua, Taleb Hirani, Brennan Hill, and Saltaformaggio. The open-source software is available for free at https://github.com/CyFI-Lab-Public/Forecast.

New Global Top-5 Ranking Based on Faculty Research Success
Georgia Tech ranks number five in the world for computer science (CS) according to a new ranking that is based on the scholarly achievements of its faculty members.
The rankings from Guide2Research, an established source of data on scientific research contributions, also place Georgia Tech’s CS program nationally at number five.
To determine its ranking of top CS programs, Guide2Research turned to Google Scholar and DBLP, a website that catalogs CS journal articles and conference papers, to evaluate the scholarly productivity of more than 6,300 computer scientists.
Known as an h-index, the measurement looks at a ratio between the number of papers an author publishes and the number of citations each paper receives in other papers. It uses this qualitative and quantitative analysis to determine the impact of an individual’s work as part of the ranking process.
“This ranking is particularly meaningful because it is based primarily on our faculty members’ academic and research success,” said Charles Isbell Jr., Georgia Tech’s dean of computing and John P. Imlay Jr. chair. “It’s solid evidence that we are delivering a world-class computing and computer science educational experience for our students.”
In 2020, Georgia Tech ranked number one nationally in cybersecurity education and fifth overall for CS in the U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges 2021 Edition Undergraduate Rankings. Georgia Tech also tied for second nationally in undergraduate software engineering.
Virtual Counselor to Help Address Vaccination Hesitancy in Black Communities
A new partnership is using a multi-million, multi-year award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to help address vaccination hesitancy and increase Covid-19 vaccination rates in Black communities.
With the $2.4 million, four-year NIH award researchers from Georgia Tech, Northeastern University, and the Boston Medical Center are collaborating with the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston TenPoint to develop a virtual healthcare counselor that answers questions and addresses concerns specifically related to the Covid-19 vaccine.
The counselor, known as Clara, is an animated character that simulates face-to-face counseling sessions using verbal and non-verbal communication cues. Along with the ability to share relevant Biblical scripture or recall details from previous conversations with an individual, Clara delivers personally relevant information about the vaccine and engages users about their specific hesitations about getting the vaccine.
According to the researchers, there are a number of benefits to this technology. Along with being available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, no insurance is needed and it may help people feel less inhibited asking questions about the Covid-19 vaccine.
Ultimately, the goal is to create a dialogue that empowers users to move toward making more informed healthcare decisions.
Clara, technically known as an embodied conversational agent (ECA), is based on an existing platform that is designed to promote spiritual and physical wellbeing in underserved communities. More than 600 people from 12 Boston churches are expected to participate in the study, which is the first of its kind to explore mobile health interventions using ECAs in a Black community church context.
“Churches are well known as effective sites for health intervention for this demographic because of the historically important role the church has played in Black communities,” said Andrea Grimes Parker, a co-primary investigator and an associate professor in the Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing.
Despite this history, Parker says very little research has been done examining how technology that is similar to Clara might amplify existing church efforts to address higher mortality rates, lower vaccination rates, and other disproportional impacts that Covid-19 has had in Black communities.
“This intervention is about giving people space where they feel safe and comfortable to explore their questions and concerns around the vaccine. We are deliberately recruiting folks that haven’t had the Covid-19 vaccine and that have concerns so we can look into questions like, ‘have you felt stigmatized in your community because you haven’t gotten the vaccine,’ or ‘what has inhibited you from getting the shot,’” said Parker.
Parker’s role in the project is leading the community-based design of the app and user experience evaluation of the program. She is also leading qualitative data collection with church members, pastors, and health leaders to better understand the barriers to vaccine uptake, as well as the existing strengths in church communities that can support vaccine uptake.
“The dialogue is being developed in partnership with the community to ensure everything makes sense in the specific church context, and that it is culturally relevant,” said Parker, who is a Georgia Tech alumna (Ph.D. HCC 11).
The program is off to a good start. According to co-primary investigator and Northeastern University computer science professor Timothy Bickmore, the feedback so far has been positive.
“Even for individuals who don’t have high computer literacy, the program is still easy to use. We’ve gotten great feedback. It seems to be working, and most people like it,” Bickmore said in an article from Northeastern University.
Although expanding beyond the current scope is not in the plans for the program now, Parker thinks using ECAs to improve vaccination uptake rates would translate well to other communities.
“Being in Atlanta and seeing even lower vaccine uptake here, I personally would love to explore adapting the intervention for Georgia. Much of the hesitation and concerns we’re seeing around the vaccine as part of the study are not specific to Massachusetts,” said Parker.
The project is formally titled Community-based Design and Evaluation of a Conversational Agent to Promote SARS-COV2 Vaccination in Black Churches. The funding for the project (1R01MD016882-01) is administered by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities.
New Browser-Based Chart Builder Gives Line Graphs, Scatterplots Their Own Audio Track
A new multi-modal data visualization tool for the web produces charts with a twist – these charts also represent information using carefully designed sounds for a richer, more powerful, and accessible way to experience data.
Released by the Georgia Institute of Technology and open-source web application Highcharts, Highcharts Sonification Studio (HSS) enables users to enter data into a spreadsheet to create traditional visual charts such as line graphs, scatterplots, and bar charts. At the same time, the tool creates non-speech audio tracks based on the data, a process known as sonification.
“The goal of this tool is to provide a simple, intuitive, and accessible way for users to import, edit, visualize, and sonify their data, and then export the results to a useful format,” said Professor Bruce Walker, director of Georgia Tech’s Sonification Lab. “We want users to be able to use the tool without having to download software or write code, and without prior sonification expertise.”
The data visualization+sonification approach lets users explore data with visual, auditory, or both modalities. This can lead to novel discoveries in its own right, and can also support users who may have limited ability to see or hear a given display.
“Visually impaired readers find sonification and auditory graphs to be very useful for getting an overview of the data, as well as identifying patterns, outliers, and points of interest,” said Walker.
Brandon Biggs, a researcher and entrepreneur who is blind, highlighted the software’s ability to allow users such as himself to create a graph that he can trust will be visually appealing.
“I love how accessible all the components are with a screen-reader and how easy it is to create a sonification,” Biggs said.
And for all users—even those who can see—sound can communicate information without requiring visual attention. For instance, instead of looking at a weather forecast or a chart of a stock price on a screen, imagine being able to hear the ups and downs played like a melody, with additional sounds highlighting points of interest in the data.
HSS is the culmination of a multi-year collaboration between Highsoft—the makers of Highcharts—and the Georgia Tech Sonification Lab. The goal of the collaboration is to develop an extensible, accessible, online spreadsheet and multimodal graphing platform for the auditory display, assistive technology, and STEM education community.
Walker said that HSS is a systematic re-implementation of his lab’s Sonification Sandbox to integrate Highsoft’s industry-leading web-based Highcharts technology with Georgia Tech’s expertise in sonification and interactive auditory displays.
The tool is open-sourced under the MIT License to allow for extensions and forks in development from the community and to ensure the tool is available to all. A Highcharts license is required for commercial use of the tool, but otherwise, usage is completely free.
“This system will complement other tools and libraries actively used by the auditory display research community and help bring sonification to an even wider audience, especially in the visualization community and in situations of limited resources,” said Øystein Moseng, the Highcharts developer leading the implementation of the HSS.
A paper describing the research and development of the open-source tool is part of the 26th annual International Conference on Auditory Displays (ICAD.org), which took place June 25-28, 2021. The paper Highcharts Sonification Studio: An Online, Open-Source, Extensible, And Accessible Data Sonification Tool is co-authored by Stanley Cantrell, Walker, and Moseng.

New AI Institute Builds Tech to Support Aging
A team of researchers led by Sonia Chernova, associate professor of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, has won a five-year, $20 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to build intelligent systems that support aging.
The grant will support the creation of the NSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups, or AI-CARING. The institute aims to develop new longitudinal, collaborative AI systems that work with aging adults, including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and their caregivers.
Most older adults prefer to remain in their own homes. But safety concerns, medication schedules, and isolation can all make it difficult for them to do so.
Imagine an aging parent who no longer remembers to turn the stove off after cooking, said Beth Mynatt, co-primary investigator, and director of the Institute for People and Technology (IPaT) at Georgia Tech. An intelligent system could support meal preparation activities, such as reminding older adults to warm up a prepared meal, detecting when the stove is left on, and sending a reminder to turn it off. Then, if the stove wasn’t turned off, the system could send an alert to a caregiver.
Now, imagine that system extended to support a full calendar of appointments, medication reminders, and schedules for multiple caregivers, among other things.
“Our goal is to create systems that help people take care of people,” Mynatt said. “Care can be a complicated task, requiring coordination and decision making across family members managing day to day demands.”
This kind of personalized AI presents a fascinating series of technical challenges as well, Chernova said. Most AI agents focus on a single choice or action — a sale, for example — and then use data from as many people as possible to understand it. But in this case, the AI is gathering in-depth data on a single person and their care team.
“We need AI systems that can interact with users over weeks or months or even years,” Chernova said. “And in order to help someone, you need to understand their values and their relationships with other people.”
The goal is emphatically not to replace human caretakers, Chernova said, but to lend them a hand.
“AI is not going to replace human caregivers,” she said. “But caring for an older relative or friend can be overwhelming. Our AI system seeks to support human caregivers by offloading some of the logistics and reminders so that people can focus on the more positive aspects of care.”
The award builds upon decades of work at Georgia Tech, both in artificial intelligence, and — through IPaT— understanding the technological needs of older adults. The new systems will be tested with Georgia families through existing programs, including the Emory-Georgia Tech Cognitive Empowerment Program, which currently serves over 100 people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment.
“The AI-CARING Institute builds on our existing strengths in AI and in technology for aging. It will create not only novel solutions but a new generation of researchers focused on the interaction between the two,” said Charles Isbell, Dean, and John P. Imlay, Jr. Chair of Computing. “Our aim in the College of Computing is to build cutting-edge technologies that improve the lives of everyone, and I can’t think of a better example than AI-CARING.“
“I am delighted to announce the establishment of new NSF National AI Research Institutes as we look to expand into all 50 states,” said National Science Foundation Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “These Institutes are hubs for academia, industry, and government to accelerate discovery and innovation in AI. Inspiring talent and ideas everywhere in this important area will lead to new capabilities that improve our lives from medicine to entertainment to transportation and cybersecurity and position us in the vanguard of competitiveness and prosperity.”
AI-CARING will include faculty from Georgia Tech, Carnegie Mellon University, Oregon State University, the University of Massachusetts Lowell, and Oregon Health & Science University. Amazon and Google are industry sponsors. The core researchers will connect with other higher education institutions, nonprofits, and government entities across the country in order to provide education and workforce opportunities to diverse groups.
In partnership with the United States Department of Agriculture, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology Directorate, and the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, the NSF is funding 11 centers within its National AI Research Institutions program. Georgia Tech has been awarded two of the grants: AI-CARING and AI4Opt, or the AI Institute for Advances in Optimization, led by PI Pascal Van Hentenryck, the A. Russell Chandler III Chair and professor in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering.
Multimillion Dollar NSF Grant Will Help to Advance Online Learning
Georgia Tech is a major partner in a new National Science Foundation (NSF) Artificial Intelligence Research Institute focused on adult learning in online education, it was announced today. Led by the Georgia Research Alliance, the National AI Institute for Adult Learning in Online Education (ALOE) is one of 11 new NSF institutes created as part of an investment totaling $220 million.
The ALOE Institute will develop new AI theories and techniques for enhancing the quality of online education for lifelong learning and workforce development. According to some projections, about 100 million American workers will need to be reskilled or upskilled over the next decade. With the increase of AI and automation, said Co-Principal Investigator and Georgia Tech lead Professor Ashok Goel, many jobs will be redefined.
“There will be some loss of jobs, but mostly we will see individuals needing to learn a new skill to get a new job or to advance their career,” said Goel, a professor of computer science and human-centered computing in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing (IC) and the chief scientist with the Center for 21st Century Universities (C21U). “So, how do you help 100 million workers reskill or upskill in 10 years? Because AI is in part responsible for this need, it is our belief it should also be responsible for finding a solution.”
That is the goal of this project, which will be led by principal investigator Myk Garn, assistant vice chancellor for New Models of Learning at the University System of Georgia and senior advisor to the Georgia Research Alliance (GRA).
“Online education for adults has enormous implications for tomorrow’s workforce,” Garn said. “Yet, serious questions remain about the quality of online learning and how best to teach adults online. Artificial intelligence offers a powerful technology for dramatically improving the quality of online learning and adult education.”
To do that successfully, the education must be personalized and scaled to unprecedented levels. Educating 100 million people in online environments will, of course, require far more time and energy than in-person educators can offer their students. That is where AI comes into play.
Researchers will build new AI techniques that can adequately and efficiently train other AI agents to interact with humans in a classroom setting, similar to the virtual teaching assistant Jill Watson that Goel has used in his online computer science classes for the past five years. This will help satisfy the scalability requirement.
“That’s the fundamental advancement in AI,” Goel said. “A human can train an AI agent in just a few hours how to teach other AI agents how to interact with humans on various subjects.”
To satisfy the need for personalized AI, researchers will train machines to have a mutual theory of mind with their human counterparts. In other words, there will be a greater understanding by both machines and humans of the others’ needs, knowledge, and expectations.
“Our vision is to develop AI agents that achieve a mutual understanding of learning expectations, outcomes, and methods between students and teachers,” said Alex Endert, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s College of Computing who will help the team analyze and understand data from the project. “Along with my students, I look forward to developing visual analytic interfaces that serve that purpose to foster trust and interpretability of AI for this domain.”
Ultimately, the hope is that education becomes more available, affordable, achievable, and, thereby, equitable. Such an expansive project, understandably, requires expertise of many kinds from many people. In addition to Endert and Goel, who will be executive director of the ALOE Institute, there will be a host of faculty at Georgia Tech will participate.
Senior Georgia Tech members of the ALOE team include Stephen Harmon (Industrial Design and C21U), Michael Hoffmann (Public Policy), David Joyner (Online Master of Science in Computer Science), Ruth Kanfer (Psychology), Brian Magerko (Language, Media, and Culture), Keith McGreggor (IC and VentureLab), Chaohua Ou (Center for Teaching and Learning), and Spencer Rugaber (Computer Science).
Other partners in the ALOE Institute include Arizona State University, Drexel University, Georgia State University, Harvard University, the Technical College System of Georgia, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, IMS Global, Boeing, IBM, and Wiley.
Georgia Tech is a key partner in two additional institutes in partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology Directorate, and the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration. Georgia Tech will lead the AI Institute for Advances in Optimization (AI4Opt) and the AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsiveness Interaction for Networked Groups (AI-CARING), the latter of which is led by College of Computing Associate Professor Sonia Chernova to support aging-related issues.
Assistant Professor Named 2021 Microsoft Research Faculty Fellow
School of Interactive Computing Assistant Professor Diyi Yang was named one of five 2021 Microsoft Research Faculty Fellows earlier this summer. The two-year fellowship recognizes innovative and promising early-career professors in the Americas who are exploring breakthrough research in computer science or a related field.
Yang was recognized for her work leading the Social and Language Technologies Lab, concentrating on research across fields of natural language processing, machine learning, and computational social science. Yang’s research works to understand social aspects of language and build responsible NLP systems with social intelligence.
“We live in an era where many aspects of our daily activities are recorded as textual data,” Yang said in her proposal to Microsoft Research. “Over the last few decades, NLP has dramatically improved performance and produced industrial applications like personal assistants. Despite being sufficient to enable these applications, current NLP systems largely ignore the social part of language.”
This ignorance limits the functionality of the programs, Yang said. This research examines what is said, who says it, in what context and for what goals in hopes of developing systems to facilitate human-human and human-machine communication. So far, her team has produced projects on mitigating bias in text, detecting mental health issues, improving support in online support groups, and more.
According to Microsoft Research’s website, Yang is the first Georgia Tech faculty member to be named a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellow since 2011 and only the third overall. Yang has earned a number of other awards and recognitions, such as Forbes 30 Under 30 in Science and IEEE AI 10 to Watch.
Associate Professor Elected SIGCHI President
School of Interactive Computing joint Associate Professor Neha Kumar was elected president of the Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) for 2021-24. She will serve a three-year term for the group, which is the premier international society for professionals and academics interested in human-computer interaction.
SIGCHI sponsors numerous conferences, publications, web sites, and other services that advance HCI through workshops and outreach. In a blog post for SIGCHI, Kumar said that she and the other incoming executive committee members aim to continue the long history of advancing the group’s key missions.
“We hope to continue to expand the excellent work that our many colleagues in this (executive committee) have done, with their commitment (among other things) to accessibility, equity and inclusion, to the safety of our community, global community building, and a #SIGCHI4ALL,” she wrote. “Together the six of us represent a wide range of perspectives; our hope is that this representation with ensure that we remain answerable to our entire global membership as we work towards supporting and fostering participation and growth locally and globally.”
Past Georgia Tech members of the committee include Jim Foley and Beth Mynatt. Georgia Tech alum Casey Fiesler served as associate chair for community engagement in 2020-21.
Kumar’s research at Georgia Tech lies at the intersection of human-centered computing and global development. She has produced research that improves technology design for historically underserved communities. Her TanDEm Lab – short for Technology and Design towards ‘Empowerment’ – has focused on health and wellbeing on the margins, centering topics such as gender, stigma, and knowledge production.
Kumar has received other honors, such as the National Science Foundation’s CAREER Award, and also chairs the Association of Computing Machinery’s Future of Computing Academy.
Georgia Tech Ph.D. graduate Tamara Clegg is also on the SIGCHI executive committee, serving as the vice president of membership and communication.
New Web Experience Launches with Focus on Users’ Needs
The College of Computing is set to launch a newly designed website on Aug. 20.
The new site will provide a faster and more user-friendly digital experience while offering greater accommodation for those with accessibility needs.
Two major components of this redesign include menus organized by user groups rather than by departmental structure and an enhanced mobile-friendly experience that is compatible with all major browsers and across all devices.
This new streamlined experience is further complemented by the updated Georgia Tech branding theme which features the iconic Tech Gold header and characteristic Institute-wide slogan, Creating the Next.
Users will notice a number of other engaging new features. These include being able to sort faculty members by their school affiliation and the ability to sort events by type and function.
The research needed to complete such a major transformation was compiled by two student teams from the School of Interactive Computing master’s in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) program.
Team members Harshali Wadge, Santiago Arconada Alvarez, Prabodh Sakhardande, Shihui Ruan, Jordan Hill, Jordan Cox, Chaoyuan Luo, Yuhan Zhou, and Lu Meng were all leads on this research as part of the HCI Special Topics class taught by Senior Research Scientist Carrie Bruce.
These student teams spent the 2019 Fall semester assembling a series of evidence-based design methods, field surveys, and testing groups that were used to inform the overall user experience of this new site.
With the student teams’ initial research and the efforts of a dedicated team of staff, the college has successfully condensed several thousand pages of content into hundreds. This aggregation and purging of old content will allow all audiences to enjoy a more up-to-date and direct experience.
For any questions, suggestions, or updates upon launch, please complete the Website Feedback Form which is located on the main menu under the About dropdown tab.
School of Computer Science Ph.D. Graduate Gets Tenure-Track Faculty Position
Thaleia Dimitra Doudali spent her Ph.D. working at the intersection of systems and machine learning in the School of Computer Science (SCS). Now she’s bringing this expertise to Madrid Institute for Advanced Studies in Software Development Technologies (IMDEA) as a tenure-track assistant professor.
“I really wanted to stay in academia so I could work on cutting-edge research and problems I am excited about, and lead my own research group,” Doudali said
Doudali will build from her research on memory systems, using machine learning to optimize resource management. IMDEA is a world-renowned research institution that builds cost-effective and high-quality software.
The Spanish location also lets Doudali establish herself in the European research community she started in when she completed her undergraduate education at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).
“I am not just going to be a professor but part of a community, collaborating with researchers and industry partners, attending conferences, reviewing papers, and having even more exposure to cutting-edge ideas,” she said.
Thriving at Tech
Research collaborations have always been important to Doudali, who chose SCS for her Ph.D. for this reason.
“Georgia Tech is a great place to do research because it’s big, very diverse, and you have a lot of support,” she said.
A big part of the support Doudali had was her advisor, SCS Associate Professor Ada Gavrilovska, who introduced her to heterogeneous memory systems research. This area builds novel systems that use new memory hardware technologies with maximum application and resource efficiency.
Doudali’s dissertation contributed system-level mechanisms to manage heterogeneous memory resources with machine learning methods. It provided the design foundations for the practical use of machine learning and lays the grounds for future use of machine learning and computer vision methods for resource management.
Her work has received numerous accolades: a best paper award finalist at the 28th International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC 2019) and a Rising Star Award for Doudali.
Along with guiding her research, Gavrilovska also advised on Doudali’s career track. Although Doudali did several industry internships, including VMWare, AMD Research, and Dell EMC, Gavrilovska was very supportive and encouraging during Doudali’s academic job search.
“Having a female role model has helped me immensely,” Doudali said. “She was always very good at letting me improve my technical and soft skills and encouraging of service work. It’s very important to work with someone who is not only a great researcher, but a lifelong mentor.”
A Legacy of Service
Doudali hopes to pay it forward as a professor herself by mentoring students. Service has been an important part of Doudali’s career at Georgia Tech. In fact because her Ph.D. visit day convinced her to attend SCS, and she volunteered on visit day every year during her time at Tech.
“When you have a nice experience, you want to recreate it for future generations,” Doudali said. “It was one of the early signs of me wanting to go academia because I really like to mentor students and give advice about Tech and Atlanta.”
After discovering this passion, Doudali decided to be more involved than just one day a year. She helped found the SCS Graduate Student Association to advocate for and bring the school’s graduate students together. Although Doudali will be graduating before the group can be official, she will help with alumni relations.
Doudali also held multiple roles at Georgia Tech’s Hellenic Society for Greek students. Throughout her years on campus, she has helped organize events to bring together students and professors of Greek heritage.
She credits this service with helping give her the soft skills that made her excel in the academic job market: communication, organization, and collaboration.
“Even if you want to focus on research, it’s always useful to talk to people and socialize to see what other people are working on and having another opinion on your work, while making friends and enjoying your free time,” she said.
Doudali is excited to bring everything she learned at Tech to her new role.
“I am excited for this new chapter in life and I will always cherish the great friends and moments I had while at Georgia Tech.”
Academic Units Welcome New Faculty Members
As it continues to meet the growing demand for computing education across campus, the College of Computing has hired several new faculty members, many of whom are starting this semester.
Assistant Professors Spencer Bryngelson and Florian Schäefer joined the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) in August. Most recently, Bryngelson worked as a senior postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology. Schäefer received his Ph.D. in applied and computational mathematics from Caltech before joining Georgia Tech.
CSE expects to welcome Nabil Imam, Yunan Luo, and Anqi Wu in January for the Spring 2022 semester. More details about CSE's new faculty are available.
The School of Computer Science (SCS) welcomed three new faculty members this semester. Associate Professor Alberto Dainotti comes to Georgia Tech from the University of California at San Diego where he worked as a research scientist. Assistant Professors Ahmed Saeed and Sahil Singla also started with SCS in August.
Saeed is a GT Computing alumnus (CS Ph.D. 19) and most recently worked as a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Sahil holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University and worked as a research instructor at Princeton University prior to taking a position with SCS.
The School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP) announced its initial faculty cohort in July. Among those listed were three new faculty members – Associate Professor Daniel Genkin, Assistant Professor Joseph Jaeger, and Associate Professor Jon Lindsay – that started with SCP for the Fall 2021 semester.
Genkin comes to Georgia Tech from the University of Michigan where he was an assistant professor. Jaeger most recently worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington while Lindsay, who is also an adjunct faculty member with Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, joins Georgia Tech following a stint with the University of Toronto as an associate professor.
The School of Interactive Computing (IC) also welcomed a new associate professor in August. However, unlike her peers in the other schools, Rosa Arriaga is a familiar face in IC. Prior to her promotion to a tenure-track faculty position, Arriaga – who joined Georgia Tech in 2007 – worked as a senior research scientist and served as Associate Chair for Graduate Studies in the school.
A handful of new non-tenure-track faculty members started with the College’s Division of Computing Instruction (DCI) this year as well. A winner of a 2021 Outstanding Graduate Teaching Assistant Award from the College last spring, Frederic Faulkner has joined DCI and is teaching full-time this fall.
Earlier in the year, DCI welcomed two new lecturers, Charles Lively and Ronnie Howard. Lively holds a Ph.D. in computer engineering from Texas A&M University. Howard is a Georgia Tech alumnus and former teaching assistant for the Online Master of Science for Computer Science program.
Air Force Officer Earns OMSCS Degree While Protecting the Nation from Cyber Threats
“Sorry, I can’t go out tonight…I have homework.” For Michael Hillmer, Spring 2023 Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) graduate, this felt like a bizarre thing to tell his friends as a working adult in his mid-20s.
“I honestly found it really difficult sometimes to balance my academic goals with work and still find time for selfcare and relaxation,” said Hillmer. “I feel like the work-life balance is a constant struggle, so I had to make sure I set dedicated time aside for leisure, even if it meant having to do homework late at night in a hotel room or at the airport to get ahead.”
Hillmer had his sights set on graduate school since he was in high school, and he wasn’t going to let a few late nights get in the way of his goals.
Due to necessary travel for work, I would sometimes be on the road for months at a time,” said Hillmer. “Between that and deployments overseas, I often found myself working on projects and taking exams in the middle of the night. Despite this, I knew that earning my master’s degree was going to be a huge achievement for me, so I found a way to make it work. Now, I get to make my goal a reality after three years.
Protecting the Nation in the Cyber Domain
After earning his bachelor’s degree from the University of Notre Dame in 2017, Hillmer was commissioned into the United States Air Force as a cyber operations officer.
“I wanted to utilize my leadership and computer engineering skills that I developed in my undergraduate studies in order to serve the country in the military,” said Hillmer. “Both my great uncle, John Hillmer, and grandfather, Ronnie Horoky, served in the Air Force before me, and I am honored to carry on their legacy.”
In January of 2020, Hillmer was stationed in Hawaii. While serving there, he decided to pursue his OMSCS degree on top of the multitude of hobbies he picked up including scuba diving, surfing, paddle boarding, running, and swimming.
“While living in Hawaii, I would make sure to maximize my time for schoolwork during the week so that I could go surfing or scuba diving every Saturday morning with friends and coworkers,” said Hillmer. “I am so excited to finally be done with three years of hard work and finally have some free time again.”
Hillmer’s other passions include playing the guitar, piano, and ukulele. After a move to Washington D.C. in January of 2023, he started taking dance lessons, particularly in swing and foxtrot. Hillmer continues to find new challenges to overcome.
Always Raising the Bar
“Hard work and perseverance are just so far ingrained in my life now that I just keep setting the bar higher for myself as I overcome obstacles in order to achieve my professional and personal goals,” said Hillmer. “When it comes to my career, hobbies, and academic pursuits, I am constantly my own worst critic. I, like most people, struggle with failure and often get frustrated if something proves to be more challenging than expected. However, these failures are what drive me to constantly better myself.”
It’s this particular mindset of hard work and perseverance that defines success in the computer science field.
“Have you ever spent countless hours on a project, sometimes staying up until three in the morning and it just won’t work?” asked Hillmer. “All of a sudden, you change one line of code, and everything just magically clicks, and sometimes you might not even know immediately why. Most people who have undergone some sort of academic program in the realm of computer science know what I’m talking about."
For Hillmer, it’s exactly that feeling of success that is so gratifying.
"Tackling a particularly difficult problem, putting all of your critical thinking abilities and programming knowledge to the test, and finally getting that working solution as the sun comes up after an all-nighter." said Hillmer. "That feeling of success, there’s nothing like it. I love taking on these kinds of challenges, and I am looking forward to how I can utilize my expertise and problem-solving skills to do so beyond graduation."
Hillmer's one piece of advice to current students is to "challenge yourself."
“I set out in this degree path hoping to earn a 4.0 GPA, just to prove that I could for my own personal achievement," said Hillmer. "However, along the way, I never limited myself to taking the ‘easier' classes. Instead, I challenged myself in courses that were both interesting and demanded a higher time commitment."
Because of his work ethic, Hillmer is still on pace to achieve this goal.
"I have also learned a variety of skills in areas that I had not expected because I challenged myself to take on these more 'advanced' courses that engaged my interests," said Hillmer.
Plans for the Future
Hillmer’s first visit to Georgia Tech will be for commencement.
“I am so thrilled to finally enjoy even a fraction of the experience that on-campus students have,” said Hillmer. “I have spent many hours online collaborating with fellow students to solve complex problems and tackle the many projects I have completed over the past three years. I will certainly miss these experiences, but I look forward to representing Georgia Tech in my future professional endeavors.”
After graduation, Hillmer will continue his service in the United States Air Force as a cyber operations officer. He plans to use his training, educational studies, and personal drive to continue learning and growing in a cybersecurity capacity in pursuit of defending the nation and creating a safer and more secure world.

Algorithmic Aftermath: Researcher Explores the Damage They Can Leave Behind
Algorithms might appear harmless, but some of them are far from it. They gather information and make calculations, but whether they do so in a neutral manner is a debated issue.
The harmful effects of an algorithm can range from labeling and categorizing someone into a box that inaccurately depicts who they really are, to altering one’s future because of the way they answered a question on an exam or job application.
In some cases, algorithms can reinforce systems that are unjust or oppressive, argues Georgia Tech researcher and School of Interactive Computing Ph.D. candidate Upol Ehsan in his paper, The Algorithmic Imprint, which was presented at the 2022 Association for Computing Machinery’s FAcct Conference.
In 2020, Ehsan saw a news report about protests occurring in the United Kingdom. Students across the U.K. spoke out against the results of the General Certificate of Education (GCE) A-level examinations, which had been graded by an algorithm for the first time. The A-levels are the final exams taken before university in the U.K. and have a major impact on whether students can attend their desired institutions.
The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual), the GCE exam governing body in the U.K., said the COVID-19 pandemic had made it necessary to pivot from manual grading to using an algorithm. Protests demonstrated that students found this change to be unacceptable, arguing the algorithm was biased against people from poorer economic backgrounds.
Ofqual removed the algorithm from its grading, but that didn’t solve the problem. Ehsan and his colleagues argue the effects of Ofqual’s algorithm lingered long after its removal. The situation is one example of how algorithms can leave hard imprints on the societies in which they are deployed.
“Most students we interviewed for the paper had their grades improved,” Ehsan said. “But they were still angry. That’s when I started thinking, ‘Why are people still angry even if their results aren’t bad?’”
And why was the U.K. the only country to receive any media coverage when the same exams are administered in more than 160 countries, including Ehsan’s home country of Bangladesh?
“This is not a U.K. issue,” he said. "This is a global issue. If we don’t share people’s stories, their narratives get erased from the historical narrative. If we didn’t bring this up, largely speaking, the Bangladesh narrative would’ve never been captured as the catastrophe that it was.
“Protests were also going on elsewhere. It’s just that they were never covered. These kids were protesting just as much as the U.K. kids.”
The fact that many of the other countries who use the GCEs are members of the Commonwealth — meaning they were once occupied by the British Empire — wasn’t lost on Ehsan.
The voices in the Global South weren’t being heard after suffering the effects of an algorithm designed by the Global North.
“Right now, the current way we evaluate an algorithm’s impact is from the birth to the death of the algorithm, from its deployment to its destruction,” Ehsan said. “When an algorithm is deployed, we do an impact assessment. When it is no longer deployed, we stop it, and that’s where we think this is the end.
“And that is the fundamental flaw in our thinking. Even when the algorithm was taken out, its harms persisted.”
The imprints can be even more damaging when they mimic or reinforce modern and historical systems of discrimination and oppression. Ehsan argues that was the case with the Commonwealth nations who also use the GCEs, and the exams were already considered to be unfair and biased before the algorithm was deployed.
“It feels like I’m paying money to my ex-colonizer for a piece of certificate that tells the world I am no dumber than a local UK kid,” said one student whom Ehsan interviewed during his research. “Sometimes it’s hard to ignore that reality.”
Ehsan compared the effects of colonialism to trying to erase pencil markings from a piece of paper. Even after the eraser has been used, the traces of the pencil markings are still visible.
“One of the things you see in postcolonialism is that there are remnants of the British infrastructure that we still live with today,” Ehsan says. “Just because colonizers leave, does not mean colonialism has left. Just because an algorithm has left, doesn’t mean its impact has left.”
Ehsan said the goal of his paper is to bring awareness to the imprints that algorithms can leave so developers can consider the potential impacts of an algorithm before deploying it.
“One of the things I wanted to do was drive policy changes,” he said. “I didn’t want this to be a research project just to have a research project. I had a moral reason behind it. I was driven by it.”
Ehsan also said he would like to see developers, researchers, and practitioners design algorithms in a way in which their impacts can be controlled and mitigated, and if an algorithm harms a group of people, reparations should be considered to atone for the damage.
“Algorithms leave imprints that are often immutable,” he said. “Just because they are made of software, it doesn’t mean there’s an undo button there.
“We need people to understand that algorithms have consequences that outlive their own existence, and if that doesn’t bring us into a more mindful, ethical way of thinking about deployments, I’d be very sad.”
The Algorithmic Imprint was co-authored with Ranjit Singh and Jacob Metcalf from Data & Society Research Institute and Professor Mark Riedl from the School of Interactive Computing.
All Schools Represented in 2022 Faculty Tenure and Promotions
Five faculty from the College of Computing have been approved for advancement.
Representing each of the College's four schools, they were included in this week's campus announcement of all faculty members that have been approved for either tenure or promotion.
Earning tenure this year are Ada Gavrilovska and Andrea Grimes Parker. College faculty members being promoted to professor are Edmond Chow, Melody Jackson, and Taesoo Kim.
College of Computing Dean Charles Isbell shared the news with College faculty and staff in his weekly email.
"These promotions represent years of sustained hard work in research, teaching, and service. Please join me in congratulating these faculty members and in thanking them for being such important members of our community," said Isbell, who is also the John P. Imlay Jr. Chair in Computing.

Based in the School of Interactive Computing, Jackson is a Georgia Tech alumna (CS Ph.D. 98) and is the founding director of the Georgia Tech Brain Lab. Kim is a faculty member in the School of CS and the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy. He is also a lead researcher in the Systems Software & Security Lab.
Earlier this month the University System of Georgia Board of Regents appointed Amy Bruckman, a professor in the School of IC, as Regents' Professor. School of IC Interim Chair John Stasko was reappointed as Regents' Professor.
Alumna Creates App to Help Victims of Sexual Harassment in Bangladesh
Public sexual harassment has become a large and growing concern in urban Bangladesh and around the world. Many women report that these incidents make them feel unsafe in their communities.
When there was a rise of cases in Bangladesh, Georgia Tech College of Computing alumna Nova Ahmed (CS Ph.D. 10) became part of an effort to provide security to women in Bangladesh. She and a team of colleagues developed a specific design intervention, called Protibadi, to support women experiencing and fighting harassment.
“I am proud to find out that I am not alone – I am one of many who want to make positive changes,” Ahmed said, who is a professor at North South University in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Protibadi, meaning ‘one who protests’ in Bengali, is an innovative web and mobile phone-based application designed to allow women to report, map, and share their stories of sexual harassment in public places.
Initially a web platform for members to share their experiences in a closed group, Protibadi evolved into a wearable device supported with the app. Recent updates have made the system more efficient by using a new cloud-based foot-printing method. This ensures users can be contacted, if needed, to provide added witness information for a reported incident. The system now allows women to:
- Quickly inform emergency contacts if they are harassed or threatened
- Document the nature and location of incidents
- Submit narratives to share their experiences
The mobile phone application is built for Android-supported devices and contains three basic tabs. The first tab has a “Save Me” button, which acts as a panic button. Once pressed, a loud sound is emitted from the mobile phone to draw the attention of other people around. At the same time, a text message is sent to each of the emergency contacts listed on the user’s profile. The text contains the user’s location, if available through GPS, and notifies the receiver that the user is in trouble.
In the second tab, users can add, delete, or edit the emergency contact details. The third tab lets users report incidents of harassment that she experiences or observes.
The website also provides additional resources. Users can request to register on the Protibadi system, which is reviewed and approved by website administrators. Once registered, users can enter reports and blogs, as well as comment anonymously on reports entered by others. All reports are visible to non-registered users. The system supports reporting in English and Bangla.
Similar apps either allow users to share experiences of harassment with friends, neighbors, family, or on social media, or they let users request emergency help in real time. Based on its research findings, the team developed Protibadi to offer the best of both worlds by combining these functions in a single unified platform.
For one year, Ahmed and the team worked to learn about sexual harassment from women at three different universities in Dhaka. During her 2017 talk at ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, Ahmed discussed the challenges that came with researching the severity of this often-unspoken problem.
“We reached out to universities and other gatherings and there was an absolute silence. No one wanted to talk about the existence of the problem,” she said.
After vandalized posters, mockery of the female researchers, and many other hurdles, the team grew and was eventually able to gather data through surveys, private discussions, and even anonymous notes. “Those stories were so personal, so painful, and it was so brave of them to share the stories,” Ahmed said during the talk, adding that their courage inspired her to break her own silence.
Initially only female researchers joined the project, and they were laughed at. But after a few more high-profile cases of abuse and harassment, Ahmed says a larger number of researchers, regardless of their gender, joined the effort.
Ahmed’s passion for supporting women also extends to her work with other organizations including Women in Science Without Borders, the Global Young Academy’s Women in Science Group, and her work with garment industry workers.
To young women considering a career in computing, Ahmed said, “The path here is not an easy one, but it’s not an impossible one. Please chase the dreams along with many others around you. Once you move forward, we will be cheering around you because there is a lot to do. “
Alumna Paying it Forward to Honor Her Mother
Kathy Pham (CS 07, MS CS 09), a Vietnamese American, Fellow of Harvard and Mozilla, and Digital Service Expert at the White House, attributes her success in no small part to her mother, Mary Hương Thị Phạm.
She remembers her mother working long hours in restaurants and nail salons, and still making sure there was delicious, comforting, Vietnamese food on the table when they got home from school.
“I attribute my own work ethic and resilience to my mom,” Pham said. “I often wish she were still around so I could pay it all back to her, treat her to a life that she deserves and worked so hard to give us. But since I cannot do that, the next best thing is to pay it forward,” added Pham.
Mary Hương Thị Phạm passed away in 2016 after a three-year battle with leukemia, just a few weeks after meeting her first grandchild. She left behind an incredible family legacy: daughter Kathy Pham; son Major David Pham (BS MGMT), who is now a United States Marine Corps infantry officer; and son-in-law Mike Evans (BS EE); as well as her 94-year-old mother and eight siblings.
Now, Kathy is honoring her mother’s life and work by endowing a scholarship in her name.
“I really want to honor my mom, who worked so hard her whole life,” Pham said. “She gave us so much. Even though she was unfamiliar with the university system, she made sure our basic needs were met so we could study and get into a university like Georgia Tech.”
“This scholarship also honors the strength and resilience of all the women who made me who I am — like my grandmother, who survived multiple bombings and had the strength to send her kids on a boat in the middle of the night to seek a better life,” Pham added. The Mary Hương Thị Phạm Scholarship will be awarded annually to eligible CS undergraduate students, with a preference for women and those in financial need.
Mary Hương Thị Phạm was one of the tens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees who fled for America in the 1980s. She became a U.S. citizen in 1995. She had a challenging life, navigating a new world and raising two kids, but she always made sure she taught her children to learn from the obstacles in their way.
“The challenges were good lessons for us,” Kathy Pham said. “We got jobs as soon as we were old enough to work so we could pay for our expenses and also help support the household. I think that’s good practice for any family regardless of income.”
“Another challenge was figuring out where I could go to college,” she added. “But that limitation led to me staying in state and going to Georgia Tech, which set such a strong foundation for the rest of my career. And I still smile thinking of all the bragging my mom would do about me and my brother going to Tech.”
One of the reasons that Kathy Pham chose to memorialize her mother with a scholarship is that she still remembers the scholarships she got in college. “The financial aspect was really helpful,” she said. “Every amount made a difference. But there was also validation as well. And it’s never too early to start giving back.”
Alumna Says We Must 'Get Past the Talk' in 2022 to Move Needle on Computing Equity
If anyone is well-poised to provide insight on potential technology trends for 2022, it’s Kathy Pham. Along with being a Georgia Tech alumna (CS 07, MS CS 09) and a member of the College of Computing advisory board, Pham is the Deputy Chief Technology Officer for the Federal Trade Commission, a position she started last year.
With a distinguished career dedicated to advancing ethics and responsibility in computer science and technology, we were thrilled when she agreed to answer a few questions as part of our What's Next in Tech for 2022 survey.
Q: What will be some of the big technology stories in 2022?
Kathy Pham: One of the big stories I see playing out over the next year and beyond will be a growing focus on the role technology plays in crises and big events like the pandemic and ongoing Covid variants, an uncertain economy, and the upcoming election cycle. I think this added scrutiny will be beneficial as we continue to push toward building more transparent and effective technologies rooted in a better understanding of our society and how individuals use and are affected by various technologies.
Q: Where do you see the biggest opportunities for entrepreneurs in the new year?
KP: I think tremendous opportunity exists for entrepreneurs in 2022 who are willing to consider what it really means to "change the world" and "scale tech." Because we now have precedent and research that can help entrepreneurs build better tech companies, the demand for new standards and safeguards will accelerate across applications and industries to ensure new and evolving technologies don’t change the world for the worse.

Q: There’s been increasing recognition of the vital role ethics should play in artificial intelligence. How do you see this issue evolving in the next year?
KP: I expect we’ll see continuing growth in funding, research, and personnel hiring for ethics in AI and Computing programs. A key opportunity in 2022 is making AI ethics and principles truly actionable by changing tech culture. This includes bringing in expertise across disciplines, having safeguards for employees to raise issues, and creating new career pathways in technology for underrepresented communities and people most impacted by the technology we build.
Q: What are some of the obstacles potentially hindering this evolution?
KP: Changing culture is hard. Changing traditional incentives is hard. We have been trained to use our tech powers to build great tech products – sometimes with regard only for what is possible in the code we write. And, we often fall in love with what we have created rather than examining the impact or influence it actually has on society. It is how we have been trained. It's also how our companies often evaluate us: They analyze how much code we write. They determine how great the code is or how "elegant" the solution is. We need to change our incentives and our culture.

Q: Where do you see the most potential in the next year for moving the needle on equity in computing education?
KP: Get past the talk! Let's change our interview questions. Let's change how we vet our next executive search. Let's change how we do venture capital funding and term sheets. Don't just hire a single person in a historically marginalized group and call it done. If incentives and culture don't change, we're not going to move the needle long term.
Alumni Invest in Overlooked Regions and Founders with New VC Firm
Venture capital is the lifeline of many new tech endeavors. But venture capitalists have traditionally only looked to invest in a few places around the country: Silicon Valley, Boston, New York. And VC’s have tended to invest in a certain kind of person as well, meaning that only three percent of capital investment goes to women and minority founders.
Two Georgia Tech alumni, venture capitalist Mark Buffington (BS MGMT 93) and serial tech entrepreneur Paul Judge (Ph.D. CS 02), looked at that pattern and saw an opportunity. They have partnered to launch Panoramic Ventures, which is the largest tech venture fund quartered in the Southeast. And they intend to invest in the Southeast, in the Midwest, and in female and minority founders.
“The market has created imbalances, as markets do,” Buffington said. “We’re proving you can build great businesses with any type of founder in any region. We see you; we’re looking for you.”
Panoramic Ventures will also take a particular interest in technology coming out of university research. Judge has previously co-founded a company, Pindrop, that came out of the dissertation research of Tech alum Vijay Balasubramaniyan (MS CS 08, Ph.D. CS 11) and his advisor, Professor Mustaque Ahamad of the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy.
“At Pindrop, it was the early connection between entrepreneurship and investors that really helped build the company,” Judge said.
Buffington and Judge see Georgia Tech specifically as vital to their strategy.
“Tech is central and core to our ecosystem in Atlanta, but it’s also key to the whole southeast region,” Judge said. Alumni are founding companies in Nashville, in Birmingham, and other places, he pointed out. “We should start thinking regionally.”
Panoramic and Pandemic
Both men experienced a “massive boost in productivity” when they went remote, Buffington said. And both think that remote work, imposed on many by the pandemic, is going to push the tech sector away from its current geographical hubs.
“You’re starting to see companies say they have no headquarters,” Judge said, citing crypto exchange Coinbase as a recent example. “Do you want to be the company trying to compete for labor against a company who will let their workforce live anywhere in the world?”
The shift won’t be without its challenges, Buffington said. It’s still hard to whiteboard remotely, which he sees as an opportunity for a start-up somewhere. And eight or nine months into the current crisis, he sees “some level of degradation in our workplace culture.”
“How do you optimize productivity, and on the flip side how do you encourage the things we as humans like?” Buffington said. “That balance is still TBD.”
Together We Swarm
Buffington and Judge are both alumni, and they like to hire alumni as well.
“Not only are Tech grads smart and knowledgeable, they are full of ambition and hustle,” Judge said. “That’s an amazingly strong fit for a start-up environment.
“It’s hard to outwork Paul and me,” Buffington added. “I think that quality is specific and unique to Georgia Tech. The people who come out are hungry, they’re naturally curious, they are driven to solve problems.”
Those qualities also make good startup founders, of course. Judge advises students that if they want to start their own company, they should first take a job at a startup to learn the ropes.
“In months, you’ll get a few years of knowledge,” Judge said. “You’ll build a network. You’ll get insight into how to build that rocket ship and launch it.”
Buffington got his start working for big companies, and says that while those jobs are good, they don’t compare to the joys of entrepreneurship.
“The highs are higher and the lows are lower,” he said, “but there’s nothing more rewarding than self-actualizing.” And those lows never completely go away, he added.
“’I’ve been doing this for 20 years and I still get nervous,” he said. “Any time you endeavor to do what Paul and I are doing — well, if you’re not nervous, if you don’t have butterflies in your stomach, you’re not pushing hard enough.”
Alumnus Building Legacy through Dissertation and Mentorship
Due to its tradition of excellence and history of graduating distinguished alumni, Georgia Tech can be a tough place to leave a lasting impression. However, one School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) alumnus is well on his way to crafting his own legacy as one of the School’s most influential alumni.
Earlier this month, CSE alumnus and current Apple research scientist Fred Hohman received ACM SIGCHI’s 2022 Outstanding Dissertation Award for his dissertation, Interactive Scalable Interfaces for Machine Learning Interpretability.
SIGCHI is the premier international society for the study of human-computer interaction and typically only presents two or three outstanding dissertation awards per year.
“It’s kind of unbelievable because you never expect this sort of thing to happen,” Hohman said. “I’m honored and still surprised to see my dissertation highlighted and recognized.”
Along with recognition at CHI 2022 this year, Hohman’s dissertation also earned him an award at the College of Computing’s 31st annual awards celebration held in April.
If the recognition his dissertation has garnered wasn’t impressive enough, Hohman presented at CHI 2022 two other papers he co-authored. There, he received a best paper award for Neo: Generalizing Confusion Matrix Visualization to Hierarchical and Multi-Output Labels.
“I’m humbled. My dissertation sits on the shoulders of giants, and there are many people that were inspirational and had similar ideas that influenced my work as well,” he said.
Hohman describes his graduate experience and dissertation as humbling because of his apprehensiveness when he arrived at Georgia Tech in 2015. Though he graduated from the University of Georgia with bachelor’s degrees in mathematics and physics, Hohman didn’t know basic computer science skills like coding.
CSE’s interdisciplinary nature interested Hohman to study at Tech in the first place. Access to faculty and students eased Hohman’s imposter syndrome, and he thrived as a graduate student.
“Between the College of Computing, multiple schools, and labs, it was clear people valued collaboration.”
Hohman studied under School of CSE Associate Professor Polo Chau and School of Interactive Computing Associate Professor Alex Endert. There, he was a member of Chau’s research group, the Polo Club of Data Science.
While at Georgia Tech, Hohman interned with the Pacific Northwest National Lab, the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab, Microsoft Research, and Apple. In fact, a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship supported his dissertation.
“Those summer internships were foundational to my thinking, my dissertation, what I’m doing now and what I want to do in the future,” said Hohman. “That was another reason why I chose Georgia Tech and to work in Polo’s lab. I found myself bringing ideas back from each summer into the next academic year and incorporating them into my dissertation.”
It was around this time when Hohman began to distinguish himself as a scholar decorated in character, not just achievements. Just as he leaned on colleagues to grow confident at Georgia Tech, Hohman used his experience to help others.
Drawing from his experience as a tutor at UGA and graduate teaching assistant at Tech, Hohman independently mentored eight students during his time at Georgia Tech.
Even more enduring is Hohman’s website where he shares most of his published work, including his dissertation. This includes videos of his thesis defense and his award talk at CHI 2022. This serves as a resource for aspiring scholars to replicate success in their own research efforts to this day.
The student body showed appreciation of Hohman’s leadership when they elected him as vice president of the School of CSE Graduate Student Association from 2018 to 2020.
“I am a strong believer in mentorship for younger students in the lab. I really wanted to try to give back from the mentorship I received from my internships,” Hohman said. “I think that I brought some of the Tech mentorship from Polo’s lab to Apple.”
Today, Hohman designs and develops interactive interfaces at Apple to help people understand machine learning models and data-driven systems. He also mentors Ph.D. students much like he did at Georgia Tech.
Hohman continues to make a name for himself through his dissertation and other research. But his legacy will resonate through the countless people who will go on to achieve in their own ways under his mentorship, influence, and inspiration.
“My best memories of Georgia Tech are meeting graduate school students that I now call lifelong friends,” Hohman said. “The community and friendships that I’ve made will outlast much of the other stuff like my awards and my work.”
Alumnus' Company Tops $1 Billion in Sales, Recognized Among Fastest Growing in Tech
A mobile commerce company co-founded by alumnus Henry Shi (OMSCS 14) has been recognized as one of the fastest growing tech companies in North America.
SnapCommerce ranked as the No. 5 fastest growing technology company in North America by the Deloitte Fast 500 for 2021. The company has more than 20 million users, $1 billion in sales, and grew by more than 32,000% between 2017 and 2021.
Shi and his co-founder Hussein Fazal launched the company in 2016 as SnapTravel while Shi was working at Google and enrolled in Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program.
The SnapTravel mobile app service used AI-driven chatbot travel agents to find and book discounted hotels and flights for its customers. From there, the company quickly evolved beyond travel with a broader e-commerce offering and payment capabilities.
At first, Shi says that their customers were people that needed to save money, not because they want to, but because $5 or $10 for them could be the difference between taking a trip or not.
“Our mission is to provide access so people can enjoy more of what life has to offer regardless of income or circumstance,” says Shi. “We offer our customers a simple mobile experience where they can get discounts, build credit, and earn rewards, which you typically can’t get if you have a lower income.”
As SnapCommerce, the company estimates that it has provided its customers more than $100 million in direct savings. Shi attributes the company’s growth to solving core customer pain points.
“We’ve built a really strong offering that solves a lot of pain points for our customers by providing something of value in a more sensible and affordable way,” Shi. “I think that’s what OMSCS is too. It’s something that’s more valuable in a much more accessible, affordable, and scalable way.”
To provide this value for their customers, Shi says the company is highly data driven. It leverages millions of market, product, and customer data points gathered each day to inform its algorithms. The company, which has raised more than $100 million in investor capital, relies on these data streams in all aspects of the business.
“We are super data driven in terms of our decision making, our analytics, at every level of the company we look at the data. We make sure it’s sound, we iterate, and then we let the data decide whether something is working or not.” Shi says.
Despite the Company’s growth, Shi says it hasn’t been without challenges.
SnapCommerce now has 150 employees, so much of his time is spent managing, hiring, and delegating. “A lot of my job is defining what success looks, understanding how we can achieve our goals, and making sure people are going in the right direction and that we are all aligned.”
Another challenge to the company’s continuing success was the pandemic. Hit hard initially, Shi says they were determined to weather the storm and return to profitability.
“We continued to push forward and managed to increase revenue and be profitable within 60 days. This allowed us to get to the next level and to think much bigger about what we could do and offer.”
Part of thinking bigger for Shi includes the possibility of taking the company public. “It’s extremely difficult to predict the market, so for now we are focusing on being ready when the time is right by growing our company and growing our impact,” says Shi.

Anqi Wu Awarded 2023 Sloan Research Fellowship
Anqi Wu, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), has been selected to the 2023 cohort of the Sloan Research Fellowship announced Feb. 15.
Wu joins a cohort of 124 other young scientists from across the U.S. and Canada selected for one of the most competitive and prestigious awards available to early-career researchers.
Joining Wu this year from Tech is Jeffrey Markowitz, an assistant professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. In all, 47 faculty from Georgia Tech have received Sloan Fellowships since the award began in 1955.
“Anqi is a talented and dynamic researcher that is already making significant contributions to better understanding how the brain works early in her career,” said Haesun Park, Regents’ Professor and School of CSE chair. “Anqi reflects the best of Georgia Tech and I’m proud of her accomplishments and that she is part of our team.”
Funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, fellowships award rising scientists $75,000 over a two-year term on any expenses supporting their research.
The Sloan Foundation offers fellowships to rising scientists across seven fields: chemistry, computer science, earth system science, economics, mathematics, neuroscience, and physics. Wu received the Sloan Fellowship in neuroscience for her impactful research in the field.
“The fellowship provides significant financial support for my early-stage research career. I will use it for the research on developing advanced statistical models for neural and behavioral data analyses,” Wu said. “My hope is to help experimental neuroscientists to decipher the massive datasets they collect and provide interpretable insights into our brain.”
Wu’s research goals are to discover scientifically interpretable patterns underlying neural populations and behaviors, understand sophisticated neuro-behavioral relationships, and promote scientific discovery in neuroscience.
Specifically, her lab develops scientifically motivated machine learning models for neural and behavior data analyses in collaboration with experimental neuroscientists.
Wu aims at leading next generation computational neuroscience by developing integrated data analysis tools to provide systematic and comprehensive understandings of neural mechanisms and biological functions and pushing the boundary of computational models for neuroscience.
Wu’s work led her to establish her research group, the BRAin INtelligence and Machine Learning (BRAINML) Laboratory. She is also affiliated with the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech, Neuro@GT, and the Georgia Tech Interdisciplinary Bioengineering Graduate Program.
Along with receiving the 2023 Sloan Research Fellowship, Wu was recognized as a DARPA Riser in October 2022 at the DARPA Forward conference.
“I am truly honored to be selected as a Sloan Fellow,” Wu said. “I’m deeply grateful that my research has been recognized by the prestigious Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.”
Art Exhibition Has College Connections
A new art exhibition curated by a College of Computing staff member is opening next week and features the work of a College faculty member.
The exhibit Extension of Self: what it means to be human in a digital world opens Aug. 15 in the Georgia Tech Library. It examines how scientists and artists can collaborate to improve access to science and technology for underserved communities.
Curated by Birney Robert, College events planner, the exhibition is the culmination of a $40,000 Georgia Tech/Microsoft Accessibility Research Seed Grant that Robert received through the Center for 21st Century Universities.
The exhibition features six exhibits, including one from a small team led by Ashutosh Dhekne, School of Computer Science assistant professor. The team created an interactive art installation called TechMyMoves for its submission.
“TechMyMoves is an exploration in mapping the human presence into an interactive art. It reflects a person’s movements through dynamically changing art that becomes more enthusiastic, energetic, and vibrant with increased activity in the indoor space,” according to the exhibition website.
The installation uses ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless technology that detects and responds to movement within indoor spaces. Movements are captured and converted to digital media using Python and Processing 4 programs. The resulting art is then instantaneously displayed on a large LED screen.
Dhekne, who earned a 2022 National Science Foundation CAREER Award for his work in wireless localization and sensing, says he came up with the idea for TechMyMoves while “daydreaming of an expressive indoor space.” To bring his daydream to reality, Dhekne worked with recent alumnus Yunzhi Li (CS MS 21) and Human-Centered Computing Ph.D. student Tingyu Cheng.
Extension of Self runs through Oct. 14 and is the first of two exhibitions planned by Robert as part of initial proposal for the seed grant program.
Artificial Intelligence System Gives Fashion Advice
People turn to many different sources for clothing style advice, from magazines to best friends to Instagram. Soon, though, you may be able to ask your smartphone.
A University of Texas at Austin computer science team, in partnership with researchers from Cornell Tech, Georgia Tech and Facebook AI Research, has developed an artificial intelligence system that can look at a photo of an outfit and suggest helpful tips to make it more fashionable. Suggestions may include tweaks such as selecting a sleeveless top or a longer jacket.

The list recognizes 10 young academics who have demonstrated outstanding achievements in artificial intelligence. Yang has distinguished herself by pioneering an approach that couples machine learning with social psychology and sociology to model human communication in social context using natural language processing.
Award Recognizes Dean's Efforts to Improve Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Computing
Georgia Tech Dean of Computing Charles Isbell is being recognized for his efforts to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in computing.
The Computer Research Association (CRA) announced this week that Isbell is the 2023 recipient of the CRA A. Nico Habermann Award.
“Over the course of three decades, Isbell has been a persistent force in broadening participation in computing. Isbell has developed wide-spread support across communities for meaningful action on broadening participation,” the organization said in a statement released on March 6.
An Atlanta native and Georgia Tech alumni, Isbell (CS 90) has done much throughout his career to make computer science (CS) and computing more accessible for women, minorities, and others from underserved communities.
“I’m honored to receive this recognition from CRA and the computing community. It’s a true privilege for me to work with others on the sometimes-unnoticed, but longstanding institutional barriers that keep so many from all computing can offer them, and allow them to offer in return,” said Isbell.
Among his achievements, Isbell played a key role in establishing the Diversifying Leadership in the Professoriate Alliance. The alliance is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and works to increase the number of CS and computing faculty from diverse backgrounds.
Isbell has served on the NSF’s Computer & Information Science & Engineering Directorate Advisory Committee. In this role, Isbell helped to develop and implement a strategic plan that has been credited with expanding access and participation. The plan has been particularly effective in building diversity in computing research.
Closer to home, Isbell conceived and co-founded the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech during his time serving as the College’s associate dean. The center was established in 2017 with the goal of democratizing CS education. The center’s mission is to ensure that all students—especially students of color, women, and others underserved in K-12 and post-secondary institutions—have access to quality CS education.
Isbell, as dean, implemented a plan to broaden minority participation in the College. Along with specific goals for community outreach and increasing faculty engagement, the plan called for a DEI leadership position to be created within the College. This goal was met last year when Isbell named Cedric Stallworth as the College’s inaugural associate dean for DEI.
The CRA award honors the late A. Nico Habermann, who headed NSF’s Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate and was deeply committed to increasing the participation in computing and tech of people from underserved groups that have been traditionally marginalized and denied access.
Award Recognizes Professor’s Pioneering Contributions to Encryption for Cloud Computing
Research in securing cloud storage conducted by a Georgia Tech professor continues to gain recognition 15-years after publication and will receive the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) Test-of-Time Award later this year.
Sasha Boldyreva’s paper that her former Ph.D. student, Adam O’Neill, presented at the Crypto 2007 conference has been cited over 1,000 times according to Google Scholar and is one of the first papers to formally study the security of efficiently searchable encryptions for cloud storage.
When Boldyreva first came to Georgia Tech she talked to database researchers and learned about the problems they had securing remote servers. Specifically, faculty were not able to search and retrieve encrypted data while also being able to maintain security.
“You want to keep your data secure, but also need to be able to retrieve it,” Boldyreva said. “I was constantly getting asked if there was a way to make searchable encryption more efficient.”
The standard method of encryption randomizes data to maintain security. However, database researchers found when they retrieved information from a remote server it was often scrambled in a way that couldn’t be deciphered.
To work around this, database faculty used deterministic encryption as a limited solution to search and retrieve parts of remote data without losing any information in the process. This made the process easier, but much less secure. In fact, because the coded text is always the same for a given plain text message, studying the application of deterministic encryption was ignored by cryptographers at the time due to its weak security.
“What is a good deterministic scheme? No one really knew,” Boldyreva said. “My Ph.D. student, my former Ph.D. advisor, and I decided to study the bigger problem of efficient searchable encryption.”
The team began by formally defined the term “efficiently searchable encryption” and proposing specific cryptographic schemes to make deterministic encryption more secure. While the team’s results showed deterministic encryption still posed security risks, Boldyreva said the goal was to define a starting point and allow academics to build from there.
“This has become a very hot topic in cryptography,” she said. “Researchers today are targeting searchable encryption with much stronger security guarantees, but they still view our paper as a starting point.”
Since the paper published in 2007, Boldyreva has continued working on searchable encryption. She recently built one of the most secure searchable encryption schemes to date with the help of her current Ph.D. students.
“This has remained my favorite area of cryptography,” she said. “It is nice to receive recognition for the challenging work we put into our research.”
The award will be presented at the Crypto 2022 conference in August. This is Boldyreva’s second test of time award. She was also recognized in 2020 by the International Conference on Practice and Theory in Public Key Cryptography (PKC) for her work on new multi-user digital signatures in 2003.
Deterministic and Efficiently Searchable Encryption was written by Boldyreva, who currently serves as the associate chair of graduate studies at the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy, O'Neill, and Mihir Bellare, her former faculty advisor.
Award-Winning Paper Reveals Need for Strengthened Ethics Education for Computing Students
A team of researchers composed of members from Georgia Tech’s School of Public Policy, College of Computing, and Center for 21st Century Universities took home multiple awards from the American Society for Engineering Education’s (ASEE) 2022 Annual Conference and Exposition for their paper.
The research, titled Social Responsibility Attitudes Among Undergraduate Computer Science Students: An Empirical Analysis, won the best paper award for the ASEE Engineering Ethics Division, best paper for Professional Interest Council 1, and was also a finalist for best overall paper for the 2022 ASEE conference. The latter honor was only bestowed on the top five submissions out of approximately 2,000.
Ph.D. student Quintin Kreth, recent Ph.D. graduate Daniel Schiff, and Director of Graduate Research Ethics Jason Borenstein represented the School of Public Policy. They conducted the research in collaboration with Ellen Zegura, professor and Stephen Fleming Chair in Telecommunications in the College of Computing, and Jeonghyun “Jonna” Lee, research scientist in the Center for 21st Century Universities.
In the paper, the researchers note that while scientists and public figures have called for improved ethics and social responsibility education in computer science, there had been no empirical evidence that computer scientists felt less social responsibility than other professionals. The researchers therefore sought to understand how undergraduate computer science students currently view their social responsibilities, especially compared to students in other STEM fields.
After surveying 982 Georgia Tech students from both STEM and non-STEM majors, the research team found that computer science students have “statistically significantly lower social responsibility attitudes than their peers in other science and engineering disciplines.” They argue that these findings suggest a need for additional ethics education in undergraduate computer science programs.
“Computing degree programs have the opportunity to help nurture a mindset within future professionals of sincere interest in protecting the public,” they write. “If not, computing risks diminishing the reputation of the profession even further, increasing regulatory scrutiny, and exposing the public to greater harms.”
In giving the Georgia Tech team its awards, the reviewers praised the researchers for their clear writing and analysis, as well as the timeliness of their topic.
“It was a great honor and surprise to receive this award,” said Kreth. “I’m told student-led papers rarely win it.”
Because they were a finalist for best overall paper, the authors have been invited to present their work again next year, at the 2023 ASEE conference, as part of a showcase event.
The paper is forthcoming and will be available online in the coming weeks at https://peer.asee.org/.
Award-Winning Tool Bridges Gap Between Supercomputing Software and Hardware
Winning awards is a common feat for Georgia Tech researchers. One student, however, recently received an award with more sentimental value than most brought back to Atlanta.
School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Ph.D. student Mikhail Isaev is the winner of the “Sudha” Award. The award for studies in computer modeling and simulation is named in memory of Sudhakar Yalamanchili, former Regents' Professor and Joseph M. Pettit Professor in Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). Yalamanchili died in 2019 after a long and courageous battle with multiple myeloma.
Isaev received the award at the Workshop on Modeling & Simulation of Systems and Applications (ModSim’22), held Aug. 10 – 12 in Seattle. The award recognizes researchers who demonstrate the most outstanding contribution to the field of computer modeling and simulation. Isaev is the second researcher presented the Sudha Award since introduced in 2021.
“I feel really honored to receive this award,” Isaev said. “I had the pleasure to meet and talk to Sudha, so I feel great to have received this award in his name and, in a way, give back to Georgia Tech.”
Isaev’s research interests revolve around co-design optimization between hardware, software, and applications in high-performance networks. Isaev’s presentation of his co-design tool, ParaGraph, earned him the Sudha Award at ModSim’22.
Working alongside Isaev in ParaGraph’s development are NVIDIA Research Scientist Nik McDonald, School of CSE Professor Rich Vuduc, and School of Computer Science Senior Research Scientist Jeff Young. Isaev also credits School of CSE alumnus and Google Software Engineer Lluís-Miquel Munguía (Ph.D. CSE 17) as an influential contributor to their co-design research.
Isaev explained that the ParaGraph group were close to Yalamanchili, making the Sudaha Award even more special. In fact, Young studied under Yalamanchili while pursuing his doctoral degree.
Along with winning the Sudha Award at ModSim'22, Isaev presented ParaGraph at the 51st International Conference on Parallel Processing. Both Isaev’s ICPP presentation and ParaGraph’s code are available for free use by fellow researchers.
Co-designing machine learning software on supercomputer networks is challenging because network simulators don’t know how to “run” software. Isaev says one must consider the best software design based upon a network’s hardware.
ParaGraph provides an automated way to emulate application software in ways that a network simulator can understand. This allows researchers to simultaneously consider changes in software and hardware. By making co-design a bilateral process, ParaGraph facilitates better supercomputing application and closes the gap for hardware and software experts.
“ParaGraph brings applications closer to hardware people and hardware closer to application people,” Isaev said.” We want to remove boundaries and ParaGraph tries to do just that.”
Yalamanchili was a longtime proponent of computer modeling and simulation, helping to launch the initial ModSim workshop in 2012 and serving on its organizing committee thereafter. Joining the ECE faculty in 1989, he made significant research contributions throughout his career in high-performance computing, communications/networking, and computer architectures.
Moreover, Yalamanchili was a beloved mentor whose commitment endeared him to his students. He received the distinguished mentoring award twice during his career at Georgia Tech.

Bader Set to Return to Faculty, Research
After five years, Professor David Bader has decided not to seek another term as the chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and is returning to faculty and his research.
Bader, a founding faculty member of the school (then a division), became chair in summer 2014. Since then, enrollment in the school’s M.S. program has more than doubled to 190 students. The school also has 71 Ph.D. students and teaches hundreds of others in interdisciplinary degrees including the M.S. in Analytics and the M.S. and Ph.D. programs in bioinformatics and bioengineering.
Research funding has also grown during Bader’s tenure as chair. CSE faculty had 83 active research projects with $67 million worth of funding ($34 million at Georgia Tech) as of August 2018. In that year, average research expenditures per CSE faculty member were $622,000 – the highest in the college. During his tenure as chair, the school’s research expenditures per year increased significantly from $4.3 million to $7.5 million.
In 2015, Bader launched the school’s Strategic Partnership Program, which allows companies to work with CSE faculty and graduate students. The program has grown to include 11 partners, including Accenture, IBM, Northrop Grumman, NVIDIA, and Sandia National Laboratories.
“Computational Science and Engineering represents the College of Computing’s strong commitment to interdisciplinary research and education,” said Zvi Galil, the John P. Imlay Jr. Deam of Computing. “We are proud of the school’s successes over the past five years.”
Bader is a fellow of the IEEE, AAAS and SIAM and has advised the White House on the National Strategic Computing Initiative. He is the editor-in-chief of the ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing, and a previous editor-in-chief IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems. He is a leading expert in solving global grand challenges in science, engineering, computing, and data science.
Barashango and Payne Bring a Wealth of Experience to Atlanta Public Schools as New Constellations Fellows
The Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech recently welcomed new fellows Yolanda Payne and Sababu Barashango – joining veteran fellow Terry Foster – to play a critical role in the center’s mission in educating and empowering teachers to teach advanced placement (AP) computer science courses. All of the teachers are based in an Atlanta Public School (APS) high school, and for many it is their first time teaching the subject. Payne will primarily support teachers at North Atlanta High School and Drew Charter School, while Barashango will be guide teachers at Grady High School and Douglas High School.
Being Polite Can Be Essential to Getting a Loan
How can someone be persuaded to loan money to a random stranger on the internet? Does the requestor need to be polite or explain the impact the loan would have? Or perhaps they should demonstrate their credibility or use facts to help others understand their need. Does one of these strategies lead to success more than another?
Researchers at Georgia Tech wanted to find out and surprisingly, went to Reddit to find the answer.
Biomedical Analytics Research Earns Team Gordon Bell Prize Nomination
A research team of scientists from Georgia Tech, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and AMD have developed the first ever algorithm to run over one exaflop on a graph artificial intelligence demonstration.
Called COAST (Exascale Communication-Optimized All-Pairs Shortest Path), the algorithm could help future researchers solve medicine’s most challenging mysteries by revealing hidden connections across large bodies of research. This would revolutionize medical research by developing better treatment plans, creating more effective drugs, and improving efficiency of resource allocations.
As a result of their research, the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) nominated the team for the 2022 Gordon Bell Prize, commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize of supercomputing.
“Within HPC (high-performance computing), COAST shows that classical ideas in algorithms and performance engineering are still critical to scaling to big machines, like ORNL’s Frontier,” said Rich Vuduc, a professor with Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE). “More importantly, we now have a new capability that may help speed up the search for new ideas in the biomedical domain.”
The magnitude of computing power needed to complete COAST’s computations requires access to supercomputers. Therefore, the team tested COAST on ORNL’s Frontier, the world’s first exascale supercomputer, and Summit.
With computing speeds of 1.102 exaflops per second, Frontier jumped to first place of the TOP500 list of fastest supercomputers when it became operational in May 2022. Summit currently ranks fourth on the list.
An exaflop is a measure of performance for a supercomputer that can calculate one quintillion floating-point operations per second. If a person calculated a simple math problem in one second, it would take that person about 30 billion years to complete one quintillion operations.
In their study, the team tested COAST twice on Frontier and Summit. On one test, the supercomputers carried COAST at a speed of 1.004 exaflops per second for 11.7 minutes. On the other, COAST reached a speed of 1.008 exaflops while completing calculations in 15.2 minutes.
The team applied COAST to UCSF’s Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE). SPOKE is an evolving biomedical knowledge network that integrates over 40 data sources into a graph with more than 50 million vertices and more than 100 million edges.
The SPOKE graph database facilitates discovery of new knowledge by enabling users to explore the graph’s structure and run analytical queries, like COAST, against it. The interorganizational team cited that past researchers used SPOKE to better understand Covid-19 and find treatments for the virus.
Essentially, COAST wades through these millions of vertices and edges to discover connections across the massive medical data network. On its 1.004 exaflop trial, COAST computed on a SPOKE graph segment of 7.06 million vertices drawing from 18 million publications.
As a result, this is the first scientific study on the integration of SPOKE with publication information through use of an all-pairs, shortest path algorithm.
The project also carries sentimental meaning as it brought together a small but growing community of computational scientists.
Joining Vuduc in the research group from the School of CSE is Ph.D. student Vijay Thakkar. ORNL research scientists Ramakrishnan Kannan (Ph.D. CS 16) and Piyush Sao (Ph.D. CSE 18) led the study and also have ties to the School of CSE as alumni and Vuduc’s former students.
“In CSE, we pride ourselves on being a family,” Vuduc said. “This study is a multi-generational collaboration that speaks truth that we stay close, even past graduation.”
Though it would take the human brain hundreds of billions of years to calculate the same number of computations as COAST, the HPC community won’t have to wait long to learn the winner of this year’s Gordon Bell Prize.
ACM will announce the winner Nov. 17 at International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis. Commonly called SC22, the conference is held this year in Dallas Nov. 13-18.
“The 2005 strategic plan for the School of CSE predicted that HPC would be critical to data mining and analysis problems,” said Vuduc. “This nomination is the culmination of hard work done toward realizing that vision.”
Black History Month: Doing the Work
Black History Month is a time to reflect on African Americans’ achievements and struggles. It’s also a time to highlight individuals who, today, are doing the work to make society more just and more inclusive.
This work is happening across Tech’s campus, by students and researchers who focus on race-related or antiracist technology and research, and by those who, simply by existing and thriving in spaces where they are underrepresented, are helping to bring about change.
Doing the Work introduces you to a few of the people who are making a difference in the Tech community and beyond.
Below are two computer science majors that are highlighted in a broader story published on the Institute's News Center featuring students from across campus.
Assata Quinichett
Computer science summer programs and high school courses inspired Assata Quinichett’s love of problem solving.
Now a third-year computer science major at Tech, Quinichett is the current co-president of Minorities @ the College of Computing (M@CC), an organization that strives to create a space where underrepresented people can feel comfortable and supported in their academic and professional pursuits in computer science. Traditionally, computer science is an overwhelmingly white male field, and M@CC provides targeted resources for academic and career development, as well as social support for students.
In her time studying computer science, Quinichett has routinely felt the isolation of being one of a small number of Black women in classes and at work. She decided to take a leadership role in M@CC so she could create spaces that alleviate the feeling of isolation. She credits M@CC for helping her professional, academic, and social development at Georgia Tech.
Quinichett’s long-term goal is to be a CEO for an influential technology company, aspiring to leverage the position and influence to increase the number of women and people of color in computer science.
Lawrence Williams
Growing up with a fascination about websites and applications from using his family’s desktop computer, Lawrence Williams knew that majoring in computer science was the best way to learn about a field that had always interested him.
He joined M@CC as a first-year student and currently serves as co-president. The group provides a space where underrepresented students can find resources and opportunities for career development and a peer support network.
Williams is still in the process of choosing his next career step, but hopes to settle in a place where he can express his creativity, advocate for accessible technology, and create growth opportunities for people of color in the tech world.
Black History Month: A Wellness Check-in
The national theme for Black History Month 2022 is health and wellness, and we are fortunate to have access to health and wellness resources at the College of Computing.
Rabi’ah Jamar is the resident mental health counselor at the College. With more than seven years of experience as a mental health clinician, Jamar is a champion for mental wellness and self care.
As such, she focuses on building strong relationships with her clients by meeting them wherever they are in their therapeutic journey. By centering on their strengths and resilience, and supporting them in reaching their potential, Jamar works to empower them to be agents of their change and healing.
As a champion of mental wellness and self-care, Jamar takes every opportunity to dispel the most harmful myths people encounter about mental health issues.
- Mental issues are caused by personal weakness.
- That people with mental health issues are being dramatic, implying that the feelings can be just "shaken off.”
“Mental issues can be caused by many things, stressful jobs, school, trauma, abuse, and chemical imbalances in some cases. It’s important that if anyone is feeling sad or down for more than one to two weeks, they seek professional support,” said Jamar.
Knowing the signs of mental health issues is necessary for being an agent of your wellness. She suggests keeping an eye out for these specific symptoms:
- Sad or withdrawn for more than two weeks
- Noticing changes in your ability to function for an extended period
- Problems with sleep for an extended period
- Extreme weight loss or weight gain
- Losing interest in things that you find pleasurable
- Lack of focus or inability to focus
Prevention is always better than waiting until treatment is necessary. Healthy practices such as self-care and getting enough rest will help promote mental wellness. Here are some healthy practices Jamar suggests for promoting mental health:
- Reading
- Exercise or play sports
- Being social / spending time with friends
- Spirituality / Fellowship
- Therapy
- Sleeping
- Journaling
Although Jamar is in the College of Computing building, there isn't currently an option for drop-in services.
There is, however, a process for qualifying for counseling services. If you’re looking to get counseling services, reach out to CARE on the first floor of the Smith Gall building to schedule an assessment.
The Georgia Tech Counseling Center can be reached at 404-894-2575, weekdays from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. When calling, ask to speak with the counselor on duty. To reach someone after business hours, call 404-894-3498 and select the option to speak to the after-hours counselors.

The Case for TikTok: Social Media Ownership has Little Impact in Security Breaches
Since the beginning of the year, the debate around TikTok, one of the world’s most popular social media platforms, has seized national attention due to its ownership by a private company headquartered in the People's Republic of China.
However, to Milton Mueller, co-founder and director of the Internet Governance Project (IGP), this focus is diverting attention away from real security and privacy conversations in the technology industry.
“If officials are concerned with privacy, then there would need to be something that applies to all information technology companies,” he said. “Cybersecurity threats from other countries have not come from the websites or services they own, but instead from direct online attacks using shared infrastructure and software.”
As Mueller points out, disinformation and security breaches are not unique to TikTok. For example, the recent intelligence leak from the Pentagon originated on Discord, a social media app that allows users to share voice and video calls, text messages, and media files in private or public chats.
“These examples show that the ownership of a social media platform is not the issue,” said Mueller. “Companies know things like disinformation and security breaches undermine their platforms and reputation, so they work to address those problems when they are brought to light.”
Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have been embroiled in controversy regarding disinformation campaigns that originated both domestically and abroad. To manage this, social media companies develop rules for content moderation. While most of the rules are mainstream, each company has its own editorial style, like traditional media outlets.
Websites that actively promote falsehoods can potentially face legal and financial troubles. Congress has held hearings in the past to make executives testify under oath about the behaviors of their companies. These hearings often are meant to determine if legislative action is needed, but in the case of TikTok, the Restrict Act had already been introduced weeks before the hearing took place.
The Senate bill outlines a plan give the U.S. executive branch almost unlimited authority to reverse any transactions, ban products and services, or force a sale of any information and communications technology that is owned by a foreign government deemed a national security threat.
Since TikTok’s parent company is owned by the Chinese government, it would be deemed a national security threat under the bill if it is passed. The fear among lawmakers is that the popular app is being used as a propaganda tool to influence the 150 million American users.
While TikTok has offered its own solution, dubbed Project Texas, Mueller argues that both proposals’ will lead to government censorship and the suppression of free speech online.
According to the research done by Mueller and his colleagues, there is no evidence TikTok promotes Chinese influence through the app. In fact, the professor discovered that TikTok is more than a trendy app used by teenagers, it’s also a platform with one billion users engaging in open dialogue on topics ranging from entertainment to education.
“I do not see open debate as evidence of Chinese influence,” said Mueller. “One of the reasons I have become an active user is because TikTok is not just an app full of dancing hamsters and goofy teenagers, there is some of that, but there are debates, news, businesses, discussion, information, and political content.”
Mueller is jointly appointed with the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy and the School of Public Policy (SPP) where he serves as the program director for the Master of Science in Cybersecurity policy track.
Through the IGP, he and Karim Farhat, a research scientist in SPP, conducted the first thorough national security threat analysis of TikTok.
Challenging Internship Provides CS Major With New Perspective
Sometimes the data makes it easy to figure out what’s happened – or what’s likely to happen – and sometimes it doesn’t.
Rohit Vemuri can attest to this fact. He’s a third-year Georgia Tech computer science (CS) major who spent the past summer as a software engineering intern with Instagram in Menlo Park, California. He worked with a lead generation team that was focused on creating and promoting advertisements for small and medium-sized businesses.
Vemuri was hired as a software engineer, but he was tasked primarily with using his data science skills to help make sense of seemingly random fluctuations in performance variables connected to customers’ Instagram ads. Vemuri then had to compare any performance discrepancies in the Instagram ads his team was monitoring and similar ads on Facebook.
The work was complex, but this was Vemuri’s fourth data science internship, so he thought he had a good idea of what to expect. He says that in his previous research internships he was fortunate because it was much easier to accurately hypothesize about outcomes based on the data.
“The data just made sense. For instance, during my computational biology and bioinformatics research internships, the data I received perfectly aligned with our hypotheses made based on physical experiments.
“With my Instagram internship, however, because of the sheer complexity of data, along with the high collinearity between variables that challenge traditional machine learning models, it was difficult to come to conclusions about user ad data,” says Vemuri, who graduated high school from St. Mark’s School of Texas in Dallas.
Despite the challenges, Vemuri says he learned a lot from this internship. One key takeaway, he had always thought it was excessive to have thousands of engineers working on products across Meta, Instagram’s parent company. Over the course of his internship, however, his perspective began to change.
“Going into Instagram, I didn’t expect the amount of work and ideation—data science, product, iOS, Android, server-side work—that goes into a single feature. But I gained a real appreciation for the large volume of user research conducted before new features are rolled out, and the sheer number of facets to consider before rolling out a product,” Vemuri says.
Added to a challenging experience and valuable real-world lessons, Meta also takes good care of its interns according to Vemuri. Interns enjoy complimentary meals and transportation to and from the office, as well as free healthcare, wellness and transportation stipends, and corporate housing.
“The best part of my internship, hands down, was my team. They were super supportive, kind, and tailored my internship to meet my interests rather than their immediate needs,” Vemuri says.
He singles out his manager, Junfei Lu, as being particularly awesome. The two would meet every day for 15 minutes to talk about Vemuri’s progress, the issues he was encountering and possible solutions.
“No other manager in any internship has been this regular with check-ins, and I really appreciate his mentorship and guidance,” Vemuri says.
Vemuri is back on campus following a busy summer. Along with his classes and working his student job, he’s also started his fifth internship – this one with Amazon Web Services.
Charles Isbell Named Next Dean of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech
Charles Isbell, professor and executive associate dean of the College of Computing, has been named the next dean and John P. Imlay Jr. Chair in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech, effective July 1.
“Dr. Isbell has a longstanding track record of teaching and scholarly excellence, leadership, and advocacy in his service to the College of Computing community,” said Rafael L. Bras, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs and K. Harrison Brown Family Chair.
“I very much appreciate his vision for the College and its alignment with the Institute’s vision and goals for education and research. I know that that, together, the students, faculty, and staff, under Dr. Isbell’s leadership, will continue the trajectory of innovation in research and education that characterizes the College of Computing.“
Isbell joined the Georgia Tech faculty as an assistant professor in the College of Computing in 2002, serving in advancing academic, research, and administrative leadership roles. During that time, he has been in the midst of various educational innovation and diversity and inclusion initiatives in the College of Computing, such as the Threads program, the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS), and the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing. In addition, Isbell has been a champion and supporter, at the Institute level, of many research initiatives and centers led by and originated by his colleagues in the College of Computing.
“I am honored to be selected as the next dean and John P. Imlay Jr. Chair of the College of Computing as we prepare for the next generation of learners,” Isbell said. “The breadth represented in the field of computing — including information and data science, computer engineering, and others — is central to the future of universities as we face changing student needs, increasing workforce demands, an evolving relationship with industry and the public, the need for new ways of supporting cutting-edge research, and persistent issues of equity and access.”
Isbell’s research interests are varied and include artificial intelligence with particular emphasis on interactive machine learning, including using machine learning to model human behavior. He is a fellow of both the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
“Even in rapidly changing times, I believe Georgia Tech and the College of Computing are well-positioned for the future,” said Isbell. “I am committed to working with faculty, staff, and students within the College and our colleagues around campus to continue to take risks and effect change so that Georgia Tech continues to provide global leadership in the field of computing and beyond.”
Isbell was one of four finalists in the international search for the College of Computing’s new leader. The search committee was chaired by Raheem A. Beyah, Motorola Foundation Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Jennifer Herazy, chief administrative officer for Academic and Research Administration, served as search director.
Isbell is a Georgia Tech alumnus and holds a Bachelor of Science in Information and Computer Science. He also holds a Master of Science and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Though born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Isbell grew up in Atlanta. He and wife Sheila D. Isbell (MS CS), division chief for the Software Engineering and Analytics Division at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), are parents to daughter Jacqueline, 14, and son Christopher, 11.
“I’d like to express my thanks to Provost Bras, Dr. Beyah, and the rest of the committee for their work throughout the search process. The finalist pool was outstanding, and I offer my congratulations to Dr. Isbell,” said President G.P. “Bud” Peterson. “We are very proud of the global recognition that the College of Computing has received for its innovative educational approaches and other outstanding accomplishments. We look forward to even greater accomplishments as Dr. Isbell leads some of the world’s best and brightest faculty, staff, and students in the years to come.”

CHI 2023: Examining Boundaries of AI 'Sensing' to Understand Office Workers’ Performance, Wellbeing
New research findings show that social acceptability and select sharing of AI results in the workplace are key to future implementation
Commercial monitoring tools are being introduced in offices alongside newer modes of work – screen meetings, remote collaboration, digital-first workflows – as a way for employers to better understand performance of their workforces.
Researchers at Georgia Tech and Northeastern University conducted a study with information workers to learn about their perspectives on being monitored and their information being collected with passive-sensing enabled artificial intelligence (PSAI), where computing devices can unobtrusively detect and collect user behaviors. That information could then be used to train machine learning models that infer performance and wellbeing of workers.
“We wanted to take a closer look at how workers perceive passive-sensing AI in order to make this technology work for the workers, as opposed to making them work for the technology,” said Vedant Das Swain, lead researcher and a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Georgia Tech.
He says there is an organizational need – for both employer and employee alike – to get better insights.
“One of the underlying subtexts of the research is that there are these asymmetries at work because the employee doesn’t have as much power as the employer. And if these technologies keep progressing as they are, this gap is going to widen because the employer will just keep getting more and more worker information.”
Researchers found that some technologies – fitness trackers and web cams, for example – used for personal activities may not translate well to work life if they are implemented without considering new norms of work. Technologies can now “breach physical boundaries,” as Das Swain puts it, and using a web cam for work while at home might involve extra setup to close doors and blur backgrounds on the screen. Workers also want careful consideration of the context in which devices can gain information.
Work devices monitoring worker activity is appropriate in many cases but work-related apps on personal devices might be a tougher sell.
The research results fall in two primary categories:
- Appropriateness – Understanding socially acceptable data to collect with passive-sensing AI and acceptable circumstances to infer worker performance and wellbeing.
- Distribution – Determining what to share about worker data – and when – with other stakeholders and the methods used.
Regarding the appropriateness aspect, Das Swain says that people in general don’t want to feel dehumanized by algorithms. His team’s work takes that idea further by learning about the mental models different workers use to determine what’s appropriate for using PSAI.
“Different workers have different ideas of what’s insightful,” he said. “For example, if I don’t talk to my supervisor about my personal life, why should this machine be sensing that type of information? The alternative viewpoint is that I already know what I’m doing at work, so give me more data. I could use sleep and commute data to infer how those activities might affect my work.”

Das Swain says there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
“And it’s not just about privacy, it’s about utility,” he said. “People find utility in different things. Some want more precise information in a work context, and some might want the holistic view of the data, in both cases to find insights for themselves.”
The second category of results – distribution – is no less tricky. Worker information is ostensibly personal in nature, but collaborative and performance measures at work necessitate the sharing of this information.
The researchers found that participants strongly felt that if a machine predicted something related to performance or wellbeing, then they should have enough time to make changes and provide context, such as if a worker is on paternity leave and must alter project deadlines.
“Only at a later point, if at all, can the data be escalated to someone else to help as the situation requires,” said Das Swain. “That was very clear in the study.”
One red flag so to speak, for Das Swain as a researcher, is that these technologies don’t afford users any control to understand newer types of personal data that are being collected and stored at work.
With algorithmic uncertainty now at the forefront of many conversations, Das Swain views these results from the Georgia Tech and Northeastern group as tangible guideposts for regulators and companies making decisions around public and commercial deployment of AI sensing tech for information workers.
The published results will be presented at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, taking place April 23-28, in Hamburg, Germany. The academic paper, Algorithmic Power or Punishment: Information Worker Perspectives on Passive Sensing Enabled AI Phenotyping of Performance and Wellbeing, is co-authored by Das Swain, Lan Gao, William Wood, Srikruthi C. Matli, Gregory Abowd, and Munmun De Choudhury. The work is funded in part by Cisco.
CHI 2023: Coaching Tool Guides Rejected Loan Applicants Toward Better Outcomes
A new web-based tool is set to provide people with unprecedented visibility into the machine learning models that are used to make high-stakes decisions impacting their daily lives.
Developed at Georgia Tech, GAM Coach is the first interactive tool of its kind to give people with rejected loan applications the power to personalize recourse options. This level of personalization means the recourse options generated by GAM Coach are realistically actionable for these applicants, which can help to ensure better outcomes for them in the future.
Existing machine learning (ML) models generate recourse options based on fixed assumptions about a broad spectrum of people. GAM Coach, however, lets users iteratively adjust loan application features, such as loan amount, payment terms, credit score, homeownership status, and more, based on their personal preferences.
“We can’t assume that developers can make the best decisions for everyone,” said Zijie (Jay) Wang, lead researcher and a Ph.D. student in Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE).
“Our goal is to give agency to the end user, so we developed GAM Coach to give people actionable recourse in scenarios like loan applications.”
GAM Coach lets users exercise this agency by developing up to five recourse plans at a time. They can customize each iteration by adjusting sliders to set acceptable ranges for loan amount, revolving balance, and similar variable features. Emojis with related text like, “☹ Very hard to change”, are used to set difficulty levels for features that might be easier or harder to change depending on the individual applicant.
[MICROSITE: Georgia Tech at CHI 2023]
The open-source tool is designed to let users “play around,” says Wang, to see how adjusting one feature can impact the model’s prediction. ’What if I raise my FICO score 10 points?’ ‘What if I reduce the loan amount?’ ‘What if I had 10% less debt?’
“Not every option is actionable for every person, but by allowing users to interact directly with their variable preferences, GAM Coach can find the minimal number of changes an individual needs to increase the likelihood of being approved for a loan,” said Wang, a recipient of the 2023 Apple Scholars in AI/ML PhD fellowship.
If the initial five plans aren’t satisfactory, users can continue to iteratively fine-tune their recourse options until they find a plan that best meets their needs.
To build a tool that can generate personalized recourse options that are realistically actionable, Wang and his collaborators first developed an innovative new linear integer algorithm and an easy-to-use interactive data visualization interface. These were paired and then put under the hood of a generalized additive model (GAM) to create GAM Coach.
GAMs are relatively common predictive ML models that are well-suited for determining optimal solutions. They’re also known for their simplicity and transparency, which is a big reason why Wang turned to the model for this work.
“Ultimately, we want to make artificial intelligence and machine learning systems more transparent and understandable for non-technical users so, we wanted GAM Coach to be a glass box rather than a black box tool,” said Wang.
“We want people to be able to understand how and why a machine learning model makes a certain decision. We tailored our algorithm to integrate into a GAM because it is highly accurate, we know how it works, and we know how exactly how it makes predictions.”
Wang and his collaborators conducted an online user study of GAM Coach as part of the project. The team examined user logs from 41 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to determine how everyday users would interact with the tool. The workers were presented with different loan scenarios and challenges, and then asked to use the tool to find recourse options that met their needs.
Along with a few minor usability issues, the researchers found that that personalized recourse plans are preferred over generic plans. They also found that users had a deeper understanding of how a decision was made and what they could do to change the outcome in the future.
Despite the success of the tool so far, Wang says his team would need input from financial and legal experts before GAM Coach could be used in the real world. However, a demo and the code are available.
“Developers can also use our flexible Python library (`pip install gamcoach`) to generate recourse plans for GAMs,” said Wang, who is advised by School of CSE Associate Professor Polo Chau.
He is the lead author of GAM Coach: Towards Interactive and User-centered Algorithmic Recourse. The paper has been accepted and is being presented at the 2023 ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems later this month in Hamburg, Germany.
CHI 2023: Digital Mental Health Resources Not Meeting Perinatal Black Women's Needs
Pregnant and postpartum Black women experience disproportionately higher rates of mental health challenges, and new research indicates that a one-size-fits-all approach to digital mental health tools and platforms is falling short for these women.
Vanessa Oguamanam has researched the correlation of digital tools and how often Black women in perinatal stages use them to improve their mental health.
According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, Black women are at “higher risk for experiencing perinatal and postnatal anxiety disorders such as depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder." The risk for PMADs is estimated to be double that of the general population.
[MICROSITE: Georgia Tech at CHI 2023]
The problem has worsened since the Covid-19 pandemic, says Oguamanam, a Ph.D. student in the School of Interactive Computing under the advisement of Associate Professor Andrea Parker, founder and director of the Wellness Technology Research Lab. Oguamanam has spent most of her doctoral career researching technology designed to benefit the health of Black women.
“I had friends who became new moms during the pandemic and just seeing the extra amount of stress that they were enduring in addition to balancing new childcare responsibilities led me to start thinking of potential ways I could address this mental health crisis with technology.” she said.
“Mental health is one of the leading complications during pregnancy and childbirth, and it’s a contributing factor to some maternal deaths. The pandemic exacerbated all of that. We’re seeing rates that are skyrocketing.”
In a paper that was accepted at the 2023 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), Oguamanam and Parker surveyed 101 pregnant and postpartum Black women. They found 34% reported moderate to severe anxiety, while 41% percent expressed having moderate to severe psychological distress, and 74% experienced a high level of postnatal depressive symptoms.
Oguamanam and Parker also studied participant interaction with four main forms of technology — social media, apps, self-tracking devices, and video calls.
“There’s been very little work investigating how we can design digital mental health tools to support Black pregnant and postpartum women’s needs,” Parker said. “We’re trying to understand what their current use and satisfaction level is with existing platforms. We need this foundational understanding to drive future design efforts.”
The research indicates that income and education levels were significant variables among the women surveyed. Of the 101 participants surveyed, 49 identified as low income, and 43 percent identified as middle to upper income. Forty-three held less than a bachelor’s degree while 58 held a bachelor’s degree or higher.
Those with higher incomes and education tended to use apps and self-tracking devices more frequently. The use of video calls varied among pregnancy status and the area of the U.S. where participants lived. Women who were pregnant and lived in the South used video calls most frequently.
Social media was widely used among all demographics.
One of the main takeaways from the study is that participant feedback shows the “one-size-fits-all” approach that digital mental health interventionists often take in their design methods can be insufficient for meeting the needs of pregnant and postpartum Black women. Oguamanam said the societal problems of systemic racism and barriers to healthcare that Black women experience aren’t often considered in such efforts.
“Years and years of experiencing racial and gendered discrimination have impacted the stress levels of Black women and their overall well-being,” she said.
“It’s important to emphasize that when we’re thinking about health disparities among racial groups, there can be a tendency to think it just boils down to differences in socioeconomic status,” echoed Parker. “But many of these disparities persist when we compare higher income groups of black women to another racial ethnic group. These inequitable differences reflect a broader set of structural forces that create barriers to healthcare access and quality and increased exposure to mental health threats.”
Oguamanam and Parker also found that 97% of the women surveyed embraced the identity of the strong Black woman, a representation that has been explored at length by social science researchers.
Researchers agree the external factors of systemic racism and healthcare barriers tend to push Black women toward that identity.
“It’s a role that a number of Black women tend to identify with, either consciously or subconsciously,” Oguamanam said. “It’s the idea of presenting an image of strength and feeling like you have to take care of you, your family, and your community and that you’re responsible for carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.”
Oguamanam’s and Parker’s study indicates women with greater adoption of the strong Black woman persona tended to use self-tracking devices with greater frequency. That trend could be attributable to those devices offering a sense of autonomy, Parker said.
“The whole vision of self-tracking devices is that you can take care of yourself,” Parker said. “You can monitor your own well-being and oversee collecting data and managing your own health. That type of platform might be more appealing to individuals who have a resistance toward being vulnerable.”
These findings only scratch the surface, and Oguamanam and Parker hope to shift current methods and discussions surrounding digital mental health toward a more inclusive environment that includes the experience of pregnant and postpartum Black women.
“More research is needed to investigate these hypotheses, and ultimately design and demonstrate the effectiveness of digital tools that support the wellbeing of pregnant and postpartum Black women,” Parker said. “Such innovations can help us make necessary strides toward achieving maternal mental health equity.”
CHI 2023: Misinformation Detection Models are Vulnerable to ChatGPT and Other LLMs
Existing machine learning (ML) models used to detect online misinformation are less effective when matched against content created by ChatGPT or other large language models (LLMs), according to new research from Georgia Tech.
Current ML models designed for and trained on human-written content have significant performance discrepancies in detecting paired human-generated misinformation and misinformation generated by artificial intelligence (AI) systems, said Jiawei Zhou, a Ph.D. student in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing.
Zhou’s paper detailing the findings is set to receive a best paper honorable mention award at the 2023 ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. Advised by Associate Professor Munmun De Choudhury, Zhou’s research demonstrates that LLMs can manipulate tone and linguistics to allow AI-generated misinformation to slip through the cracks.
“We found the AI-generated misinformation carried more emotions and cognitive processing expressions than its human-created counterparts,” Zhou said. “It also tended to enhance details, communicate uncertainties, draw conclusions, and simulate personal tones.
“We’re one of the very first to look at this risk. As more people started to use ChatGPT, they’ve noticed this problem, but we were one of the first to provide evidence of this risk. And there are more efforts needed to raise public awareness about this potential and call for more research efforts to combat this risk.”
[MICROSITE: Georgia Tech at CHI 2023]
Zhou started exploring GPT-3 in 2022 because she wanted to know how one of the early predecessors to ChatGPT would handle prompts that included misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic. She asked GPT-3 to explain how the Covid-19 vaccines could cause cancer.
“The results were very concerning because it is so persuasive,” Zhou said. “I had been studying informatics and misinformation for a time, and it was still persuasive, even to me. The output would say, ‘It can cause cancer because there is this researcher at this institute, and their research is based on medical records and diverse demographics. The research supports this possibility.’ The writing of it is so scientific.”
Zhou and her collaborators accumulated a dataset of human-created misinformation, including more than 6,700 news reports and 5,600 social media posts. From that set, Zhou and her team extracted the most representative topics and documents of human-generated misinformation. They used those to create narrative prompts, which they fed to GPT and recorded the output.
Both the GPT-generated output and the original human-created dataset were used to test an existing misinformation detection model called COVID-Twitter-BERT (CT-BERT).
Zhou said while the human- and AI-generated datasets were intentionally paired, a statistical test showed there are significant differences in detection model performance.
CT-BERT experienced a decline in performance in detecting AI-generated misinformation. Out of 500 prompts based on AI-generated misinformation, it failed to recognize 27 as false or misleading, compared to missing only two from the human-generated prompts.
“The core reason is they are linguistically different,” Zhou said. “Our error analysis reveals that AI misinformation tends to be more complex, and it tends to mix factual statements. It uses one fact to explain another, though the two things might not be related. The tone and sentiment are also different. And there are less keywords that detection tools normally look for.”
Zhou’s experiments showed that GPT could use information to create a news story using objective, straightforward language and use that same information to create a sympathetic social media post. That points to its capability of changing tone and tailoring messages.
“If someone wants to promote propaganda, they can use it to customize a narrative toward a specific community,” Zhou said. “That makes the risk even greater. It shows that it has some flexibility to alter its tone for different purposes. For news, it can sound logical and reliable. For social media, it conveys information quickly and clearly.”
As LLMs continue to rapidly grow and expand, so do the risks of misinformation.
ChatGPT operates on Open AI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, the latter of which was released on March 14. Since ChatGPT was released, Zhou has given it the same prompts she gave to GPT-3. The results have improved with some corrections, but the latter has the advantage of having more available information about Covid-19, she said.
Zhou said steps should be taken immediately to evaluate how misinformation detection tools can adapt to ever-improving LLMs. She described the situation as an “AI arms race,” and the tools that are currently used to combat misinformation are well behind.
“They are improving the generative capabilities of LLMs,” she said. “They’re more human-like, more fluent, and less and less distinguishable from human creations. We need to think about ways we can distinguish them and how we can improve our misinformation detection abilities to catch up.”
CHI 2023: Safe Spaces Facilitating Frank Discussions on 'Taboo' Women's Health Issues
In many countries around the world, cultural and religious taboos create environments that silence women and gender minorities and restrict access to health information.
But a team of graduate students within the School of Interactive Computing have explored how technology can help circumvent these barriers so that women can engage in freer communication on stigmatized health issues.
Hannah Tam, Karthik Bhat, and Priyanka Mohindra conducted research to study how safe spaces could be curated to support 35 women of Indian origin in discussing subjects that are otherwise considered taboo.
Neha Kumar, an associate professor who teaches jointly with the School of Interactive Computing and the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, served as advisor to the students. Kumar is the director of the Tandem Lab, which works to explore cultural taboos and investigate their impact on health and well-being among women and gender minorities internationally.
[MICROSITE: Georgia Tech at CHI 2023]
During the two-week study, the researchers provided the group with discussion prompts on stigmatized topics such as menstrual health, sexual wellbeing, fitness, body image, diet and exercise, and mental health.
“Taboos persist because Indian culture is still largely patriarchal,” Bhat said. “The cultural norm is that you don’t talk about these things with other people, you don’t talk about them with other genders, you don’t talk about these things outside the home. It becomes hard to seek care where it’s necessary and community where it’s necessary.”
The restrictions of societal taboos escalate when adolescent girls begins their menstrual cycles, Mohindra said.
“Everything about how they’re treated changes,” she said. “They’re not able to go to temples because it’s considered impure. They’re not allowed to serve food or go into the kitchen. Nobody should know you’re going through that, even though it’s a natural process.”
“Anything that has to do with intimacy or anything sexual and a woman is involved, that’s looked down at no matter what age you are,” she said. “Girls are afraid to ask their mothers about these things.”
Tam said she and her colleagues used legitimate peripheral participation (LLP) as a framework to analyze the social learning that took place in the Whats App group they established for the study. The LLP framework creates social interactions among community members that enable them to share knowledge and experiences while allowing other members to observe and learn without actively participating.
“We found that learning happened at all levels, which was applicable to both core members and peripheral members, or members who might not have been as active in the group,” Tam said.
The group of women participated with partial anonymity, which also provided a sense of security and comfort to most users. Using WhatsApp only required members to provide their phone numbers, which helped them conceal their identities to minimize the risk of facing judgment in their communities.
The group conducted follow-up interviews with 10 of the 35 participants and found that some had started connecting with other group members offline, which Tam said was a step forward from where they had started.
“People found relief in being able to talk openly,” Tam said. “One member said she hadn’t felt comfortable saying the word ‘period’ aloud — even among her close friends.
“As members were unpacking their experiences with taboos outside the group, that led to a lot of members questioning traditional systems and social structures.”
The goal of the project, Bhat said, was not about making a direct impact on the health of the women participating. Instead, the researchers aimed to find ways in which social media platforms could enable sharing of sensitive information and equip participants with the ability to navigate cultural barriers.
“Our findings suggested that this space and our intervention gave them the avenue to learn how to engage on stigmatized health topics and then take these conversations out into the world,” he said.
“There needs to be dedicated efforts to educating at various levels so that people who are in positions of power, such as governments and healthcare authorities, recognize and address the challenges in health communication that we saw, and work to address them. This is critical for women’s health and wellbeing worldwide. But given that these problems exist and are not going away anytime soon, how can technology support us in addressing this gap now?”
Cisco Funds 30 Campus Research Projects Including Edge Computing Initiative
Through an innovative collaboration with Cisco, the global leader in networking for the internet, the Georgia Institute of Technology is pursuing 30 quick-turn research projects that touch on key priority areas such as internet for the future, capabilities at the edge, and optimized application experiences.
The master research agreement builds on more than two decades of close collaboration between the two organizations. Begun last year, the funded projects are by design short term, lasting an average of 12 to 14 months ― enough time to assess the technology and its potential for Cisco to warrant further investment.
Each project undergoes quarterly reviews by Cisco, with a Georgia Tech faculty member serving as the principal investigator, and Ph.D. or postdoc students occasionally leading a team of students.
“Cisco Research conducts and fosters research in emerging areas of technology that are of strategic interest to Cisco. Georgia Tech is one of the first universities to have signed a longer-term master research agreement through which we have funded several projects over the past year. The vast breadth of research activities within GT makes it an ideal partner for us to collaborate and fund research longer-term” said Ramana Kompella, head of research at Cisco. “We have already achieved quite a bit of success through these collaborations over the last year, and we have started renewing some of these projects for the next phase of research based on the results and impact already achieved.”
“As an R1 research facility, our job is to engage in research and train the next researchers coming up. Partnerships like Cisco are critical to our mission,” said Jeffrey Davis, director of Corporate Relations at Georgia Tech, who oversees the Cisco partnership. “Cisco’s program supports our students, our faculty, and the Institute overall. A lot of this research could benefit not only Georgia, but also people worldwide.”
Davis said Cisco evaluators challenge Georgia Tech students on their findings, with some of the brightest students recruited to join Cisco upon graduation.
Pitching Projects: Cisco’s Version of ‘Shark Tank’
Being selected for a research project is akin to pitching investors on the popular reality show, “Shark Tank.” According to Davis, professors have 15 minutes to present their research project to Cisco. A Cisco tech leader evaluates each proposal to determine which ideas will move on to a “deep dive,” or one-hour detailed presentation to include a Q&A discussion between the professor and subject-matter experts at Cisco, and a decision quickly follows.
The funded projects support one of Cisco’s strategic pillars that include secure, agile networks; hybrid work; optimized application experiences; end-to-end security; internet for the future; and capabilities at the edge.
In fact, one of the Cisco-funded projects focuses on the next wave of computing “at the edge.” The increasing presence of cameras in our environment, coupled with advances in computer vision and machine learning, has enabled several novel applications, including space-time tracking of suspicious vehicles and smart traffic lights.
“Edge (computing) is an emerging disruptive technology, and more and more applications require it. Companies like Cisco, Microsoft, and Google are already starting to pay attention to edge computing, and it could be a huge opportunity for academia,” said Umakishore Ramachandran, professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Computer Science. “We are seeing a perfect storm of technology and applications coming together at the edge to support multiple camera applications.”
One reality of moving to edge computing, explained Ramachandran, is its resource limitation compared to a cloud data center owing to the smaller footprint of the edge. His team has developed techniques to allocate the scarce resources intelligently. Specifically, they are looking at how to dynamically assign resources using multiple, nearby edge sites, while meeting the latency requirements of the services.
“Cisco is a pioneer in edge computing. Now they are seeing that there's an opportunity to look at it from a sensor processing in a geo-distributed fashion,” he said.
Partnering with Cisco gives Ramachandran’s team assurance that they are on the pulse of what’s next in tech.
“We can vet the new technology and ensure our research is not already happening in the industry. We want to be sure that what we're developing is not just used for publishing papers but also can be applied in the commercial world. That's where the Cisco partnership is so important,” he said.
“Edge computing is the next generation paradigm that’s still in its infancy, and there are a lot of things that need to be researched to shape the future of edge computing. This area is super exciting and important for Cisco, and we had an exciting collaboration with Ramachandran’s research group on some of the key technological advances required to make edge computing a success,” said Kompella.
Health-monitoring Wearables
Omer Inan, associate professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), is six months into another quick-turn project, also funded by Cisco, to test how well his knee brace, a wearable with sensors that measure arthritis inflammation inside joints, works in patients with arthritis. His 2020 research paper on the topic was recently named the runner-up best paper by IEEE Sensors Journal.
“We are taking the hardware that we previously developed in our group and understanding how well it performs in a clinical population,” said Inan, who is collaborating with a team of clinicians at Emory School of Medicine led by Sampath Prahalad, that will assess the wearable joint monitoring technology in as many as 30 patients.
“Cisco is very interested in telehealth and IoT-related research, and our project encompasses both,” said Inan.
He noted that arthritis sufferers today must go to a doctor's office and undergo blood tests and imaging to monitor their condition, which is both cumbersome and too infrequent given how rapidly the disease changes. “Only being able to get data at the doctor's office makes it hard to really understand what's going on and to manage the condition properly,” he said.
Inan anticipates that his wearable sensor could one day help remotely manage rheumatoid arthritis, especially in rural areas that are medically underserved. Cisco, he added, could be a key partner in making that happen.
“Cisco understands connectivity and the overall ecosystem of telehealth so well that they could be a great partner to help us understand how to move this technology toward translation to start benefitting patients,” said Inan, noting that Cisco also brings invaluable expertise in the internet of things,, privacy and security of interconnected devices.
“While health is top-of-mind for everyone in the world, we at Cisco Research are exploring how technology can improve healthcare outcomes for everyone by leveraging Cisco’s core tech prowess in areas such as IoT and cybersecurity,” said Kompella.
AR/VR Tools
Georgia Tech’s Institute of People and Technology (IPaT), an early funding recipient, was awarded projects to develop augmented reality (AR) tools to improve healthcare worker productivity, research technologies that reduce workplace stress, and develop contact-less inventory management solutions that could lead to more efficient contactless supply chains, noted a recent Georgia Tech story.
“As the world is grappling to deal with the one-in-a-century pandemic, a key aspect of remote work that was particularly of grave concern is remote worker wellness and productivity, (and) one of the key themes along with Georgia Tech researchers we are conducting cutting edge research in,” Kompella added.
Climate Action Teams Supporting United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals
More than 110 Georgia Tech computing students are taking action to fight climate change and environmental injustice. The students are members of 10 climate action teams participating in Tech’s Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) program.
The teams work to address climate and environmental concerns that align with sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015.
Climate action initiatives are being spotlighted by Georgia Tech and other University Global Coalition institutions as part of this year's United Nations Action and Awareness Week, which runs through March 10. Along with the VIP teams, the Institute is showcasing work in teaching, research, and operations that positively impacts climate issues.
The UN's SDGs were developed to address the world’s most monumental challenges including poverty, social justice, and climate change. Some of the objectives are cleaner air and water, cleaner energy, and sustainable communities.
Several different majors are represented on 10 VIP teams that are supporting the UN’s sustainability goals. However, of the 228 total students, 53% are computing students. These include computer science (CS), computational media (CM), and human-computer interaction (HCI) students.
The team with the highest concentration of computing students is Bits of Good. The team works with community organizations to develop customized software solutions and scalable web applications. The team’s projects correlate to five UN sustainable development goals:
- No Poverty
- Zero Hunger
- Good Health and Wellbeing
- Quality Education
- Gender Equality
“Bits of Good develops software for nonprofits, so while non-computing students do participate as designers or product managers, the work is a great match for computing students,” said Ellen Zegura, computer science professor and faculty advisor for the Bits of Good VIP team.
“Several current Bits of Good projects are related to SDGs, and one has a particular focus on sustainable building practices.”
For the sustainable building project, the Bits of Good VIP team is working with Southface Institute, a nonprofit based in Atlanta. The team is developing an efficient online library and project-plan builder for Southface’s EarthCraft Program. This program trains teams on building standards and provides a blueprint for sustainable development.
Another VIP team working on climate action goals that consists of mostly computing students is HumaniTech. The group has been working on several projects with the Beverly School of Kenya. The team has been working with the school for more than a year to help make the school an education resource for students and the community. Some of the projects include conducting energy audits, installing solar panels, and developing sustainable agriculture and renewable energy initiatives.
A data visualization is available for more details about the VIP teams working to support the SDGs. Several campus events are scheduled this week as part of Georgia Tech’s participation in SDG Action and Awareness Week.

CLOSING THE GAP: Teaching Computers to Reliably Identify Objects in Images using Large-Scale Unannotated Data
Training computers to detect and reliably identify objects in images is a challenge even with advanced computing power. Humans need only see common objects a few times to learn and remember what they are. Computer programs, however, require massive datasets that humans have annotated by identifying and drawing boxes around all objects present.
One way to get around this is to train computers to use unlabeled data, by allowing the computer to make predictions of what is in the image (called “pseudo-labels”) and training on those predictions. But, if the computer gets the object classification wrong—such as labeling a walrus as a dog—the faulty data may be used in the future and the system risks becoming unreliable.
Zsolt Kira, assistant professor in Interactive Computing, and his team, including Ph.D. student Yen-Cheng Liu and collaborators at Meta, are working to train computer programs to classify objects more accurately in images and mitigate the risks of mislabeling data in large-scale real-world unlabeled datasets.
New research from the group is some of the first to explore how computer programs implement semi-supervised object detection or SSOD—using labeled data to apply the pseudo-labels to raw images that haven’t been labeled—for open datasets found on the internet.
Image-based object detectors are usually applied to closed or curated datasets where unknown objects are not present. The team’s goal is to correctly identify objects in open datasets, from the web and elsewhere, while making sure unknown objects are not erroneously added.
“Developing methods that can be applied to ‘in-the-wild’ data, which often include many types of objects that are not relevant, is important so that we can scale to millions or billions of unlabeled object examples,” said Kira.
The research team discovered that part of the solution in working with open datasets lies with optimizing another tool in the process, an out-of-distribution (OOD) detector. This tool determines if an object is from a known category, or distribution, of objects. In one example, dogs and cats may be two known categories, but if a goat slips by and is added to either category, it corrupts the data. An optimized OOD detector, however, should be robust enough to filter out any unknown objects.
The team did extensive studies and found that offline OOD detectors performed very well to remove image object data that should not be part of the object distribution (the goat for example). This was due in part to the OOD detector’s architecture being independent of the object detector itself.
Conversely, online OOD detectors, which try to do both object detection and OOD detection at the same time, did not perform as well and accurate object detection degraded over time.
“This work has the potential to significantly improve object detectors for some of the popular applications, such as self-driving cars which can collect large amounts of unlabeled data as they drive around,” said Kira. “Other areas such as medical domains can leverage our methods as well, since only skilled doctors can annotate the data.”
This new approach to SSOD using open datasets and implementing offline OOD detectors achieved state-of-the-art results across existing and new benchmark settings, according to the team’s findings.
The work also provides new directions in designing more accurate and efficient OOD detectors for future research. Kira notes this is especially necessary because obtaining very large amounts of real-world unannotated data (think cell phone images) is much easier to do than to have humans laboriously annotate them.
The research is published in the proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, taking place October 23-27, 2022. The research paper Open-Set Semi-Supervised Object Detection is co-authored by Yen-Cheng Liu, Chih-Yao Ma, Xiaoliang Dai, Junjiao Tian, Peter Vajda, Zijian He, and Zsolt Kira.
This work was sponsored by DARPA's Learning with Less Labels (LwLL) program under agreement HR0011-18-S-0044. The researchers’ views and statements are based on their findings and do not necessarily reflect those of the funding agencies.
Coding Workshops Provide Resources and Support to Teachers in U.S.V.I.
The Constellations Center for Equity in Computing hosted professional development workshops in the US Virgin Islands this summer.
The workshops were part of a collaboration between Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research and Georgia Tech’s College of Computing, which is home to Constellations. Program fellow Yolanda Payne spearheaded the initiative.
The professional development program consisted of three two-day workshops that covered coding for computers, robots, and circuits. Dozens of teachers participated in the workshops, which were hosted at the St. Thomas and St. Croix campuses of the University of the Virgin Islands.
“The level of excitement and engagement of these teachers will truly translate to classroom benefits for students. We immersed the teachers in new learning that they could readily take back to their classrooms,” Payne said.
According to Payne and other organizers, what sets Constellations’ workshops apart is the sense of community offered to teachers once the workshop is over.
“Often with this type of workshop, teachers are handed resources but not given the support to really implement them in the classroom,” said Diana Bowen, an assistant mathematics professor at the University of the Virgin Islands who assisted in coordinating the workshops.
“Those participating in these workshops, however, are learning how to move from using the resources to building out lesson plans and implementing them in the classroom,” she added.
Bowen believes the impact of these workshops will be felt beyond the teachers and the classroom. Several high school students were able to attend them alongside their teachers and the exposure was a mindset shift.
“They get exposed to the latest technologies, they get exposed to programming, they get exposed to computing in ways that are relevant to what corporations and companies are doing in these fields. I think this is a first step in helping our students see why a STEM career or pathway could be rewarding for them,” said Bowen.
Each of the workshops gave teachers resources that they could take back to their classes and pass along what they learned in the workshops to their students. The giveaways included the Finch Robot, along with circuit kits from Chibitronics and Microbits.
Cultivating this computer science community through professional developments, summer camps, providing resources, and supporting teachers beyond the workshops could allow the next generation of CS professionals to stay on the island.
“In the past we’ve had students go to enrichment programs stateside. But, when we empower teachers and they begin to integrate these resources in their classrooms, students start to say ‘oh, in my classroom we’re doing robotics, I can do this here today,’” said Bowen.
Collaborative Startup Helping People in Disadvantaged Communities Learn Entry-level Data Science Skills
Across businesses and organizations of all sizes, there are rapidly growing opportunities for data science workers.
Many people, however, particularly those from economically disadvantaged communities, are often excluded from the training opportunities necessary to be competitive for these jobs.
To address this issue and increase the diversity of the data science field, Georgia Tech has launched DataWorks.
The new hybrid program – which recently earned a $1.5 million National Science Foundation (NSF) grant – works closely with community partners to hire and train people from under-resourced communities in Atlanta to do data science work.
“There are so many tasks peripheral to computer science that, while not requiring a degree to perform, are critically important to the CS community,” said DataWorks founder and School of Interactive Computing (IC) Associate Professor Betsy DiSalvo.
Part startup company, part outreach effort, and part research platform, DataWorks provides its employees with on-the-job training to learn entry-level data wrangling skills.
To learn data skills like cleaning, linking, and reformatting, employees use real-world “messy” data – provided mostly by Atlanta non-profit organizations. Once cleaned the data are returned to an organization to help it fulfill its mission and business objectives.
“Rather than just teaching, we think it’s important to have people situated in a real work environment. In doing so, they feel like what they are doing is more valued. It also allows them to see themselves as being a part of this industry,” said DiSalvo.

For one of its first pro bono projects DataWorks employees worked with Enterprise Community Partners, Inc. on an affordable housing database project.
“The DataWorks team completed the detail-oriented work of pulling data from public reports, aligning it with other public data, and producing one complete dataset for our affordable housing database and website project,” said Sara Haas, southeast market director for Enterprise Community Partners.
“With DataWorks’ help, we’re helping to level the playing field by providing residents, community advocates, public partners, and nonprofit developers access to the same type of data that others have,” said Haas.
DataWorks started in January with four part-time workers, which were recruited through west Atlanta organization Raising Expectations, a non-profit mentoring and tutoring program. DiSalvo had hoped to be up to 10 employees this summer but then the pandemic hit. At the time, she wasn’t sure the program would survive.
But working remotely, DataWorks continued building its reputation and training its employees through pro bono work. It has also recently picked up a few paying clients from the private sector, as well as a new contract with Atlanta’s Center for Civic Innovation.
Along with new clients, the program also has new funding. Price Waterhouse Cooper (PWC) recently donated $25,000 to the program. Along with the funding, this collaboration with DataWorks includes a donation of 300 volunteer hours from PWC.
DiSalvo and her co-primary investigators – School of IC Associate Professor Carl DiSalvo and Georgia State University Assistant Professor Ben Shapiro –also recently earned a $1.5 million NSF grant for the program in August.
“We’re actually down to three employees now, but one left to take a full-time job with Georgia Tech so we consider that a win,” DiSalvo said happily. She added that with the new NSF funding – and the additional work – she expects to move forward with hiring additional DataWorks employees in the near term.
The NSF grant is part of the Connected Communities program. Along with continuing to hire and train people from Atlanta’s under-resourced communities, the grant will fund research into the program to build more training tools and programs for employees that have the potential to scale to other cities.
One aspect of the research will address bias. DiSalvo says she wants to better understand how having different groups of people doing peripheral data work ultimately impacts outputs. Another research question will look at what kind of structures can be developed to do this kind of community engagement work within an institution like Georgia Tech.
“We know there are a lot of grassroots communities that could take advantage of data and they don’t because there just aren’t structures in place for them to do it,” said DiSalvo.
DataWorks is currently part of Georgia Tech’s Constellations Center for Equity in Computing, which is housed in the College of Computing.
“Constellations focuses on increasing equity in computing. DataWorks extends our reach by providing a pathway to computing opportunities for those who wish to acquire the necessary skills while applying them in an entry-level position,” said Cedric Stallworth, assistant dean for Outreach, Enrollment and Community in the College of Computing, which houses Constellations.
Aside from DataWorks, DiSalvo has been helping people to acquire entry-level skills since she was a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student. For her dissertation project as she created Glitch, a program in which young Black men were hired from the community to test video games. Like DataWorks, testing video games is entry-level work that doesn’t require a degree or special skills other than knowing how to play video games.
“These young men were testing real games for real companies. During the three years that Glitch was active, 33 young men, mostly from lower-income neighborhoods, participated in the project. More than 50 percent went on to major in computer science or related field,” said DiSalvo.
According to Stallworth, programs like Glitch and DataWorks are key to developing a social climate of inclusivity and opportunity for people in underrepresented communities.
“We must be creative and diligent in our efforts to widen the doorway that leads to success in computing,” said Stallworth.

College Climbs Two Spots in Latest Rankings of Country's Best Graduate CS Programs
Computing at Georgia Tech has leaped forward two spots to No. 6 overall in the U.S. News Graduate Rankings for 2023 released today.
Georgia Tech’s computer science (CS) program is the only top 10 graduate computing program to advance more than one position in the overall rankings.
“Rankings are by their nature an imperfect measure. But in the last 17 years, we have climbed six places, while none of our peer institutions have seen that kind of systematic rise. Our reputation and our reach are growing,” said Dean of Computing Charles Isbell.
The latest U.S. News Graduate Rankings also recognized growth in CS-related specialty fields at Georgia Tech. Along with artificial intelligence climbing from No. 7 in 2019 to No. 5 in 2023, systems jumped six places from No. 10 to No. 4. CS as a specialty ranks No. 6 while programming languages also moved up in the new rankings from No. 16 to No. 15.
“I want to thank every faculty member, staff member, and student in the College for their hard work. We have only been able to make this journey because we have made it together. I am proud of us, and I can’t wait to see what we’re going to do next,” said Isbell.
Georgia Tech’s graduate CS program is tied for sixth with Cornell University and the University of Washington in the 2023 U.S. News rankings. The last rankings for graduate computer science programs were released in March 2018 for 2019.
Georgia Tech’s undergraduate CS program ranked No. 5 nationally in the U.S. News Best Colleges for 2021.

College of Computing's Hall of Fame Gets New Interactive Digital Home
Visitors to the College of Computing Building (CCB) will notice a big change just inside the front doors.
An interactive video wall was installed this week. The wall features six liquid-crystal-display (LCD) video panels, each with 1080p resolution. The six panels are connected to create screen that is nearly 14-feet long and four-plus feet tall.
The main purpose of the interactive video wall is to create a digital home of the College’s Hall of Fame.
“We needed a way to highlight our Hall of Fame members and our Rising Stars that was highly accessible, interactive, and easy to engage with,” said LaDonna Cherry, creative services manager for the College and project lead for the video wall. “This solution meets that need and allows for so much more.”
The video wall has 32 touch points. This lets multiple users simultaneously learn about Hall of Fame members and Risings Stars, young alumni from the College who are making an impact on computing and computing education. The display will include photos, brief biographies, and other details about Hall of Fame members.
“As soon as students walk into the building they will see the Hall of Fame, which is to say, they’ll see how far their Georgia Tech computing degree can take them. It will serve as history and inspiration," said Charles Isbell, College of Computing dean and John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
Beyond the Hall of Fame, users can explore the College’s history through an interactive timeline. The story wall also features information about the College’s five schools, research activities, and more.
“The new video can also be used as a collaborative space that features messages about 'Read Week,' midterms, advising updates, scheduled holidays, and special events. We would also like to feature student, staff, and faculty profiles,” said Cherry.
Those wanting to provide collaborative material, share an update, or promote a special event through the College’s new story wall can email Cherry at lcherry@cc.gatech.edu.
The digital story wall replaces the photo display of people from the GT Computing community that had been in place for several years. The photos have been relocated to a busy hallway on the first floor of the CCB.
College Continues to Rank Among Top 5 for Undergraduate Computer Science
The College of Computing is #5 for undergraduate computer science according to the 2022-2023 U.S. News and World Report Best College Rankings released this week.
The College maintained its ranking from last year and is tied for fifth place with Cornell University, Princeton University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
The College continues to rank well in what U.S. News and World Report refer to as “computer science specialties. These include:
- #3 in game development
- #4 in cybersecurity
- #4 in data analytics
- #5 in software engineering
- #6 in artificial intelligence
- #7 in computer systems
- #14 in programming
“I am quite proud of us that our computing programs continue to be ranked so highly. This year, we have gone up in the rankings in game development, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and computer systems, as well we should. As we continue to grow in all areas, I expect the rankings will come to reflect our impact,” said Charles Isbell, College of Computing dean and John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
Overall, Georgia Tech continues to rank among the top public universities in the nation, and its programs remain among the best in the country.
College Significantly Increases Number of Students Attending Diversity in Computing Conference
Georgia Tech's College of Computing continues to seek opportunities for its student body to become more diverse and inclusive, and learn how to better allies. It annually sends students to the ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing conference, and this year the college is able to send 94 percent more students than in a normal year. The increase is primarily due to reduced registration fees and no traveled needed for the now virtual conference.
College's Skyrocketing Stature, Global Impact Highlight Galil's Legacy
Zvi Galil, the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, will be stepping down from the deanship on June 30, concluding nine years of transformational achievement and numerous successes at the College. He will be returning to the faculty to teach, research, and serve as an ambassador of Georgia Tech's online programs.
Galil’s deanship was marked by accomplishments on many fronts. Under his leadership the College has risen into the top eight nationally, top seven internationally – the only top 10 computer science program to rise either in rank or in score in the last ranking (2018).
In a measure of the College’s public perception, applications to the College have grown ten-fold, and enrollment in on-campus degree programs has nearly doubled during Galil’s tenure as dean. Computing is now the largest major at the university, and the most selective – our majors average higher than 1500 on the SATs.
The College’s reputation among employers and alumni has seen dramatic enhancement, as well. As a result, the College's career fairs and its corporate affiliates program have grown in stature in recent years. The GT Computing Career Fair regularly sets new attendance records with more than 160 companies participating (with nearly 20 companies wait-listed) this year in the Klaus Building Atrium. Several hundred students from across campus attended each day of the four-day event.
More and more companies are also participating in the College's corporate affiliates program (CAP). During Galil's tenure as dean, CAP grew from 14 companies generating $280,000 in membership fees in 2010, to 63 companies raising $1.13 million in the current academic year. Galil exceeded the fundraising campaign goal by 40 percent – the largest percentage above the goal of any unit at Georgia Tech. Alumnus James Liang's gift of $1.5 million for an endowed chair was at the time the largest international gift in Georgia Tech history, and the only endowed chair by an international donor.
The successful fundraising provided the resources for continued investment in the College and its faculty, and also helped fund four Interdisciplinary Research Institutes and four Interdisciplinary Research Centers led by the College. Galil doubled the number of endowed senior faculty chairs to 10, in addition to four new junior faculty chairs. Faculty rose from 85 to 102, with six or more to join later this year.
It is a testament to the values and productivity of the College’s faculty that, with just 8 percent of Georgia Tech faculty, GT Computing teaches about 18 percent of the Institute’s credit hours (about 13 percent of undergraduate and about 24 percent of graduate credit hours).
“Under Zvi’s leadership the standing of the college has improved along a host of traditional metrics – but truly great universities are in the center of the important issues of the day,” said Executive Associate Dean Charles Isbell, who will take over as dean on July 1. “Through OMSCS, Zvi has led the way in moving the college to the center of perhaps the most important of national discussions: the role of affordability and access in computing. That is a transformative accomplishment.”
OMSCS
Creating the College’s now-famous Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program took years of labor from dozens of faculty and staff members. Galil’s vision was the driving force behind the entire project, however, and guided many of the decisions that make the program so distinctive.
One of the most significant was OMSCS’ unique admissions policy. Instead of admitting only a few of the highest-achieving applicants, Galil insisted that the program be open to anyone who had met the requirements. Those online students have been just as successful as the on-campus students admitted through a much more selective process.
Now, five years after its founding, the online master’s has nearly 9,000 students and an international reputation for changing the game in online education. The OMSCS program embodies Georgia Tech's motto of Progress and Service with its unique combination of prestige, accessibility, and affordability. Its launch has changed national and international perspectives on Georgia Tech.
“OMSCS offers wider access to the high quality of our residential program at a substantially lower cost. It helps realign today’s workforce with the requirements of a thriving 21st-century economy. This is a fundamental, revolutionary shift from the prevailing paradigm of higher education, in which a brand is bolstered by exclusion and high tuition fees,” Galil said.
Building a community
“Being a dean is about community building, about involvement, support, and empowerment,” Galil said. “You’re closer to students, you’re closer to staff and faculty. I view my role as dean as working to inspire our community by helping them to connect, encouraging them to excel, increasing their confidence.”
Galil has made particular efforts to integrate staff members into the community – through regular meetings and an annual staff retreat – and is well known for matching high standards with a collaborative approach and approachability.
“Zvi pushes for excellence in a way that stretches everyone,” said Alan Katz, assistant dean for finances and administration. “He believes in sharing information, serving others, and providing incentives – he’s a carrot person, not a stick person.”
“You would never know Zvi has such a high status because he’s so down to earth,” said Pam Ruffin, director of human resources for the college. “You can walk up to his door and he’ll take time to talk to you.”
Even those who don’t make it to his office hear from Galil regularly, through a steady stream of e-mails he sends out to the entire GT Computing community. Although he is known as “the e-mail dean,” he almost never mentions himself in his missives. “I love to brag about the achievements of faculty, staff, and students,” he said. “I want everyone to know they are the most important part of the College.”
In parting
Galil – a highly influential scholar in the fields of algorithmic design and analysis, and computational complexity and cryptography – is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery and of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. Prior to coming to Georgia Tech, he served as the dean of engineering at Columbia University and the president of Tel Aviv University.
Yet, he views his deanship at GT Computing as the most satisfying period of his career.
“In OMSCS, we pioneered a program that proved high-quality, cost-reduced online education at scale is doable, and that it satisfies an unmet need – being radically more accessible and affordable than on-campus options,” Galil said. “I view it as my greatest achievement.”
As for his message to GT Computing faculty, staff, students, and alumni, “GO JACKETS!”
Collegiate Cup 2019: A Hackathon with Equity in Mind
Before Super Bowl LIII came to town there was another championship happening just a few miles down the road from Mercedes-Benz Stadium.
From Jan. 25-27, students from eight colleges and universities gathered for the first-ever Collegiate Cup hackathon in the state of Georgia. The hackathon was the first statewide competition that focused exclusively on improving the quality of life for Georgia residents.

The College of Computing community is saddened by the recent news of the passing of Philip Enslow, Jr., who taught computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology from 1975 to 2000.
Enslow wrote a pioneering paper in 1978 on distributed systems. He also built a comprehensive telecommunications program in the College and helped guide the creation of the College of Computing in 1990.
“When I became founding dean of the college in late 1989,” said Peter Freeman, “Phil instantly became a point of reference and guide for me. To say that he was key to the early success of the College would be an understatement.”
Enslow is not only remembered for his technical accomplishments, but also for being a warm and welcoming member of the Georgia Tech Computing community.
“Phil certainly played a role in me choosing Georgia Tech,” said Mustaque Ahamad, a professor of computer science who came to Tech in 1995. “He was a colleague and a mentor to so many of us.” Ahamad was not alone in that sentiment.
“Phil is largely responsible for me accepting a faculty offer at Tech,” said Mostafa Ammar, Regents’ Professor of Computer Science, who joined in 1985. “I remember his interview questions about important practical things that are often glossed over in classes. To this day, one of my goals in a networking class is to make sure our students can answer Phil’s questions.”
“He was a true legend,” said Ellen Zegura, the Stephen Fleming Chair of Computer Science. “He was instrumental in shaping the College of Computing as an institution, but he also shaped so many individual careers.” Zegura first met Enslow when she came to Tech as an assistant professor in 1993.

Computer Science Graduate Students Foster Community
Graduate students in the School of Computer Science (SCS) have formed a new student association, the SCS Graduate Student Association. The group hosts social events, career workshops, and provides support for SCS students.
After the faculty held a graduate student listening session in December 2020, it was clear students wanted more peer support.
To this end, a group of graduate students started creating programing to connect to their fellow students. The first event was a game night and photo contest judged by Professor Alexandra Boldyreva held on Gathertown, a participatory video chat platform that creates a virtual party environment. Next they hosted a panel called "Things nobody told me about a Ph.D.!"
With the success of early programming, the group formed and officially registered as the first-ever School of Computer Science Graduate Student Association (SCS GSA), which officially launched in August.
“It’s great to see our students take the initiative to come together and form this organization,” SCS Chair Vivek Sarkar said. “I look forward to the SCS GSA contributing to an increased vitality in our school’s community.”
The founders of the association say they hope to create a sense of belonging for students, improve student – faculty relationships, and provide students with an opportunity to give back and become leaders.
“I see it as an avenue to create cherished memories of our graduate school journeys beyond the walls of our research and labs,” said Harshit Daga, SCS GSA president and final-year Ph.D. student.
With this in mind, SCS GSA’s programing is tailored to be both practical and personable. The group recently helped the school with onboarding the incoming master’s and Ph.D. students by combining them on a single Slack platform. For the semester the team has planned events such as a Ph.D. welcoming event, monthly TGIF gatherings, and townhalls.
“I envision GSA to better the lives of graduate students by improving the mental health and well-being of the student body and providing opportunities for them to succeed,” said third-year Ph.D. student and treasurer Sharjeel Khan.
Along with Daga and Khan, the GSA leadership team includes: fourth-year Ph.D. student Bhuvesh Kumar as vice president, second-year Ph.D. student Manasvini Sethuraman as events chair, second-year Ph.D. student Mehrdad Ghadiri as student and faculty affairs chair, and third-year Ph.D. student Dhruv Kuchhal as communications chair. SCS alumna Thaleia Dimitra Doudali (CS Ph.D. 21) serves as alumni liaison.
Computer Scientists Build, Test, and Present Model to Curb Online Ban Evasion
Ban evasion is a problem for users, moderators, and platforms alike. Evaders torment users on popular websites and get banned by moderators, only to return under a new account to continue their malicious behavior.
Students and faculty at Georgia Tech’s College of Computing published a study that can help online moderators stop ban evasion in its tracks. Claiming to be the first data-driven study on ban evasion behavior, the research team developed a new model that proved it can predict and detect ban evasion.
Not only does the model keep the internet an enjoyable environment for users, it makes the world a safer place. Along with harassment and spread of terroristic propaganda, some real-world acts of mass violence are linked to ban evasion according to the study.
“Ban evasion is arguably one of the biggest threats to web safety and integrity,” said Srijan Kumar, assistant professor at the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and co-author of the study. “It is incredibly trivial for malicious actors to create a new account to continue their malicious activities after their original account is banned. We wanted to understand how ban evaders behave and how to detect and prevent it.”

Along with Kumar, contributing researchers of the study from the College includes Gaurav Verma, a Ph.D. student at the School of CSE, and Manoj Niverthi, an undergraduate student majoring in computer science.
Kumar, Verma, and Niverthi teamed with Wikipedia to attain data, study evader behavior, and test their model. Its application could be used where ban evasion occurs such as popular social media platforms, eBay, Khan Academy, and Twitch.
Although moderators currently use manual and automatic algorithms to identify malicious activity, they often encounter difficulty predicting and detecting evaders following bans. No tool exists to help automate ban evasion detection and prediction.
The team’s model recorded a high accuracy rate in predicting likelihood whether malicious “parent” accounts will evade bans in the future using data such as account creation timing, linguistics, and edit history.
The study showed the model can correctly detect “child” accounts soon after creation. This is useful for moderators to automatically monitor their platforms from ban evaders.
The same model also yielded high success rates of discerning ban evaders from malicious non-evaders.
Kumar, Niverthi, and Verma have made the ban evasion dataset available to the community to aid future research and develop additional tools for Wikipedia moderators.
The team will also present findings of their study virtually at The Web Conference, April 25-29. Formerly WWW Conference, The Web Conference is the premier yearly international conference on the topic of future directions of the World Wide Web.
This will be Niverthi’s first ever paper presentation and Verma’s first paper presentation as a Ph.D. student.
“Our work opens new avenues to be proactive to smart ban evaders and malicious actors, rather than being reactive,” said Kumar. “I am incredibly proud of both Gaurav and Manoj who co-led the work.”

Constellations Hosts 500 Georgia Educators for Equity and Computer Science Summit
The Constellations Center for Equity in Computing continues to expand access to computing education not only to Georgia students but educators as well.
In collaboration with the Georgia Department of Education (GADOE), CS4GA, and Counselors for Computing, Constellations hosted more than 500 Georgia teachers, administrators, IT professionals, and counselors for a one-day online summit.
The summit featured four tracks with unique content and resources with a special focus on equity. Sessions discussed topics such as lack of quality internet access in South Georgia and its effect on recruiting computer science teachers, to creating a positive culture for female employees in technology-related roles.
Junious Williams, the keynote speaker and principal of Junious Williams Consulting, encouraged educators to change their mindset from one of inclusivity to one of belonging. “You not only have to invite people in, but you need to welcome and engage them in co-creating the systems, practices, and structures so that everybody at the table owns those,” said Williams.
Other speakers included Constellations Senior Director and Google’s Global Lead for Diversity and Strategy Kamau Bobb and Caitlin Dooley, deputy superintendent of teaching and learning at GADOE, who offered opening and closing remarks, respectively.
Participants were also given a chance to network with one another and get to know the leaders of the Georgia chapter of the Computer Science Teachers Association.
“The summit was great! I loved the actionable learning opportunities and the chance to continue networking,” said Sallie Holloway, an instructional coach for Gwinnett County Public Schools.
Constellations also announced a new initiative at the summit for the 2021-22 academic year. Beginning this fall, the center will support up to 20 Georgia high schools in establishing new Computer Science Honor Society chapters. Applications for the program close on April 23.
In addition to the professional development summit, the organizers hosted an invitation-only implementation workshop the following day. According to the requirements of Georgia Senate Bill 108 (SB 108), all Georgia high schools must offer a course in computer science by 2024. To help schools meet these requirements, organizers also offered a one-day workshop for district leaders to work on plans to implement computer science education in their schools. This workshop provided leaders an opportunity to assess the current state of computer science education within their district, leverage resources, and connect with support programs to ensure successful implementation.
“The implementation workshop provides a safe place where a variety of educational stakeholders can honestly discuss their current status in computer science education and collaboratively plan to implement or improve their CS programs. I enjoy listening to the teams' open conversations, where everyone has a voice, on how they can make sure that equity and inclusion are part of their visions, goals, and plans,” said Sababu Barashango, a Constellations fellow and co-leader of the workshop.
Constellations, CS4GA, and GADOE will continue to support these cohorts through follow-up sessions along their short-, mid-, and long-term journeys. The organizations will also continue to invite all school systems in Georgia who have yet to implement CS programs to these workshops including one occurring this summer.
Constellations will host its second annual virtual computer science professional development summit, which will be open to educators around the world, June 21-23.
Recordings of summit sessions can be watched on the Constellations YouTube channel.

Courses Explore Sustainability, Support UNs’ Sustainability Goals with New Funding
A team of School of Computing Instruction (SCI) faculty members received funding to explore sustainability in courses they teach. The grants are part of Georgia Tech’s effort to contribute to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.
Priority for the funding was given to faculty who teach courses with high impact and enrollment to incorporate sustainability concepts into their curriculum. SCI faculty teach 1000- and 2000- computer science courses required for all Georgia Tech undergraduates, as well as several upper-level courses. This funding will help expose many students to the relationships between computer science (CS) and sustainability.
Grant recipients include SCI lecturers Mahdi Roozbahani, Rodrigo Borela Valente, and Nimisha Roy as project leads. They will spend the coming months generating course materials that can help foster environmental responsibility and sustainable thinking among students.
SCI Inaugural Chair Olufisayo Omojokun and Senior Lecturer Melinda McDaniel also serve on the team and will primarily work on expanding the reach of these materials beyond the course sections taught by Roozbahani, Borela Valente, and Roy.
“One of the great things about SCI is that each Georgia Tech undergraduate student essentially takes a course with one of our faculty members at some point before graduating. We’re always looking for innovative ways to leverage this campus-wide reach of our School,” Omojokun said.
“This particular funding opportunity, which represents one of Georgia Tech’s bold steps in helping the United Nations address significant global challenges, is as good as it gets.”
Sustaining ethics in AI classes
In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced substantial advancements, and its presence at Georgia Tech draws thousands of students each semester. Roozbahani will focus on sustaining ethics in large AI classes. He explains that students engage with sophisticated algorithms and models to tackle intricate challenges. However, such models can also introduce significant adverse effects on society including job displacement, privacy concerns, biased outcomes, and manipulation of public opinion.
“The goal is to prepare our students to effectively address the challenges inherent in the AI domain while fostering sustainable solutions grounded in ethical and equitable considerations,” Roozbahani said.
Energy efficiency in code design
Borela Valente’s goal is to redesign core CS courses at Georgia Tech to incorporate energy efficiency and sustainability considerations in code design. Courses will impact nearly every undergraduate student at Georgia Tech in addition to 10 to 15 instructors.
“This initiative seeks to educate students on the role they can play in minimizing the carbon footprint of the code that powers our daily lives,” Borela Velente said.
Students will learn the environmental impact of code execution, assessing code efficiency from an energy consumption perspective, and computing the carbon footprint of code execution at large scales.
Sustainable software engineering
Roy seeks to incorporate sustainability modules into undergraduate CS capstone and software engineering courses. The course redesign comprises sustainable software engineering principles, engineering with sustainability focus, environmentally sustainable implementation techniques, and real-world sustainability-themed projects.
“The redesigned curriculum aims to enhance learning outcomes, enabling students to evaluate the environmental and social implications of software development and integrate sustainability in the project development phases via optimized algorithms, efficient data storage, and green technology,” Roy said.
The initiative is expected to impact approximately 1500 students and 7-10 instructors annually, with the redesigned classes slated to launch in Fall 2024.
One of the goals of Georgia Tech’s strategic plan is to connect globally and amplify impact by contributing to global collaborative efforts that advance the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through education, research, and service. In response, Sustainability Next developed a plan to expand SDG concept and skill integration across the undergraduate curriculum.

The Coda building’s ninth floor atrium was full in late April as senior administrators from the National Security Agency (NSA) recognized Georgia Tech students for placing first at the 2021 NSA Codebreaker Challenge (CBC) where they scored over 230,000 points.
For the past eight years, Georgia Tech students have placed among the top three finishers at the competition.
“I want to congratulate Georgia Tech for this incredible win that showed the talent you have at this school,” said Pamela Jock, NSA chief of Academic Engagement. “Being second the last three years and winning this year shows us that you are dedicated, you have a lot of perseverance, and that you care about the future of our country.”
Jock also touched on the rigorousness of the competition. Every year, less than 1% of competitors solve the challenge, and in 2021 there were only 46 solvers among the 5,464 participants. Georgia Tech had eight of these solvers, more than any of the other 631 academic institutions in the contest.
According to a release from the NSA, the 2021 competition involved a simulated cyber-attack on an NSA facility. Students worked independently to solve increasingly difficult scenarios over the course of five months. The challenge is specifically set up to highlight the type of work the NSA faces daily across the United States.
“Investing in our nation’s next generation of cybersecurity professionals has never been more important,” said Col. Richard Malaga, commander of NSA-Georgia.
Malaga presented Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay Chair of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech, with a trophy to commemorate the achievement of the Institute’s 377 student competitors.
“I am pleased, but not surprised that our students did so well in the Codebreaker Challenge,” said Isbell. “We have worked hard to make Georgia Tech one of the best cybersecurity programs in the country, and a large part of that is that we have top-notch students who constantly push themselves (and us) to do even better.”
Two faculty at the Georgia Tech School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP) assisted in helping organize students for the challenge. Professor Taesoo Kim incorporates the challenge every year into the curriculum of the Information Security Lab to teach students about the importance of the NSA’s work. Postdoctoral scholar Wen Xu was recognized as the leader of the Georgia Tech team and received a letter from the NSA on behalf of Georgia Tech President Ángel Cabrera during the April ceremony.
“We’re thrilled to see the Georgia Tech team at the top of the NSA Codebreaker Challenge once again,” said SCP Chair Richard DeMillo. “We try to immerse our students in real-world challenges facing cybersecurity professionals and our continued success tells me we are meeting that goal.”
Online and on-campus students from Georgia Tech earned a total of 234,982 points to win the challenge. Students from the University of North Georgia finished second with a total of 152,239 points. The NSA Codebreaker Challenge is open to all students with a valid institute email address. For more information on the competition, please visit the CBC website.
Cyber Faculty Sets Out to Protect Nation’s Investment in AI Manufacturing
Advancement in technology brings about plenty of benefits for everyday life, but it also provides cyber criminals and other potential adversaries with new opportunities to cause chaos for their own benefit.
As researchers begin to shape the future of artificial intelligence in manufacturing, Georgia Tech recognizes the potential risks to this technology once it is implemented on an industrial scale. That’s why Associate Professor Saman Zonouz will begin researching ways to protect the nation’s newest investment in manufacturing.
The project is part of the $65 million grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration to develop the Georgia AI Manufacturing (GA-AIM) Technology Corridor. While main purpose of the grant is to develop ways of integrating artificial intelligence into manufacturing, it will also help advance cybersecurity research, educational outreach, and workforce development in the subject as well.
“When introducing new capabilities, we don’t know about its cybersecurity weaknesses and landscape,” said Zonouz. “In the IT world, the potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities and corresponding mitigation are clear, but when it comes to artificial intelligence in manufacturing, the best practices are uncertain. We don’t know what all could go wrong.”
Zonouz will work alongside other Georgia Tech researchers in the new Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Facility (AMPF) to pinpoint where those inevitable attacks will come from and how they can be repelled. Along with a team of Ph.D. students, Zonouz will create a roadmap for future researchers, educators, and industry professionals to use when detecting and responding to cyberattacks.
“As we increasingly rely on computing and artificial intelligence systems to drive innovation and competitiveness, there is a growing recognition that the security of these systems is of paramount importance if we are to realize the anticipated gains,” said Michael Bailey, Inaugural Chair of the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP). “Professor Zonouz is an expert in the security of industrial control systems and will be a vital member of the new coalition as it seeks to provide leadership in manufacturing automation.”
Before coming to Georgia Tech, Zonouz worked with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and the College of Engineering on protecting and studying the cyber-physical systems of manufacturing. He worked with Raheem Beyah, Dean of the College of Engineering and ECE professor, on several research papers including two that were published at the 26th USENIX Security Symposium, and the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium.
“As Georgia Tech continues to position itself as a leader in artificial intelligence manufacturing, interdisciplinarity collaboration is not only an added benefit, it is fundamental,” said Arijit Raychowdhury, Steve W. Chaddick School Chair and Professor of ECE. “Saman’s cybersecurity expertise will play a crucial role in the overall protection and success of GA-AIM and AMPF. ECE is proud to have him representing the school on this important project.”
The research is expected to take five years, which is typical for a project of this scale. Apart from research, there will be a workforce development and educational outreach portion of the GA-AIM program. The cyber testbed developed by Zonouz, and his team will live in the 24,000 square-foot AMPF facility.
Cyber Student Receives $16,000 and Year-long Mentorship
Master’s student Subhiksha Ramanathan is a step closer to her goal of working in financial technology thanks to the 2022 Women in Cyber Scholarship and the Karishma Babu and Vijay Balasubramaniyan Endowment Fund.
The awards are sponsored by the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) and the Georgia Tech Foundation. Ramanathan is pursuing a Master of Science in Cybersecurity (MS Cybersecurity) at the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP) at Georgia Tech.
“I am extremely elated by these awards,” she said. “I owe this to my parents and professors. They have been extremely supportive throughout my time at Georgia Tech.”
Recipients of the Women in Cybersecurity Scholarship are handpicked by FS-ISAC from a pool of international candidates. Winners receive a $10,000 award along with a pass to attend the organization’s annual summit in Colorado and a one-year mentorship with Bank of America.
Ramanathan first learned about the scholarship opportunity in her Information Security Policies class taught by SCP Professor Peter Swire. The master’s student said Swire was among the first she reached out to when she received the news about winning the award.
“I am delighted that Georgia Tech helped prepare Subhiksha for winning this prestigious scholarship,” said Swire.
When Ramanathan isn’t in class or studying, she works with Georgia Tech faculty as a teaching or research assistant. She has worked extensively on research projects involving a confluence of cybersecurity and machine learning. She has worked on automated topic modeling of global cybersecurity strategies with Nadiya Kostyuk, assistant professor in SCP and the School of Public Policy (SPP). She has also assisted Research Scientist Maria Konte, by working on a network traffic anomaly analysis using machine learning.
Now, Ramanathan works with Jon Lindsay, SCP associate professor jointly appointed with the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, where she is focusing on the geopolitical arena of cybersecurity.
As a recipient of the Karishma Babu and Vijay Balasubramaniyan Endowment Fund, Ramanathan will receive a one-time fellowship award of $6,000. Managed by the Georgia Tech Foundation, the fund supports graduate students from India.
The endowment was created thanks to a donation by Georgia Tech alumni Karishma Babu (MS ECE 09) and her husband Vijay Balasubramaniyan (Ph.D. CS 11). Ramanathan was nominated for the award by SCP Professor Mustaque Ahamad, who advised Balasubramaniyan when he was pursuing his degree at Georgia Tech.
“It is wonderful that a current MS Cybersecurity student is chosen for a fellowship that has been established by a graduate of our MS Cybersecurity program and his wife,” said Ahamad.
“Subhiksha is a great choice for this fellowship because she is an outstanding student and her interests and expertise cover both technology and policy areas of cybersecurity.”
With two awards under her belt, Ramanathan is preparing for her final semester at Georgia Tech. After she graduates next May, she wants to land a position at a top-tier financial institution as a comprehensive cloud security engineer. Regardless of the role, she wants to use the machine learning and cybersecurity techniques she learned at Georgia Tech and SCP to help with fraud detection and battling cyber threats.
“It feels good to almost be done,” said Ramanathan. “But I will miss Georgia Tech and SCP, it has been my entire life while I have been here.”
Cybersecurity and Computer Science Faculty Wins NSF CAREER Award to Develop the Future of Internet Measurement
This week, the National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded a junior faculty member at Georgia Tech with the prestigious CAREER Award for his work to improve the reliability of active internet measurement.
Current technologies allow researchers to quickly map the internet, its behaviors, and security threats. With the help of the award, Assistant Professor Paul Pearce will work to improve the reliability, repeatability, and efficiency of current and new techniques used in active internet measurement.
“When you measure billions of things, scale is critical, but how do you make sure the measurements are reliable without ground truth?” said Pearce. “This grant will help me continue my work understanding internet measurement and security.”
Reliable measurements are critical for many network and security fields including censorship, vulnerability detection, and network outages. Pearce’s research proposal aims to develop methodologies, datasets, and tools to conduct sound measurement studies in the future. He and his research group will establish these valuable resources for researchers, industry practitioners, policy makers, and governments.
Another component of the CAREER award is Pearce’s plan to work with the College of Computing at Georgia Tech to create a community college pathway program to prepare students with non-traditional education paths for the transfer process. The program would also help provide the incoming students research opportunities when they arrive.
Pearce followed a non-traditional path to college, having attended two California community colleges simultaneously. He hopes his experiences, combined with this award, can help community college students pursue research and graduate school at a top 10 research university like Georgia Tech.
“Getting involved in research as a transfer student can be difficult,” said Pearce. “The requirements and timeline for transfer students can be very strenuous, making getting involved in research a challenge. I hope with the creation of a dedicated program aimed at helping transfer students engage in research we can improve that process.”
Every year the NSF recognizes around 500 higher education junior faculty across disciplines through the Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER). These awards recognize potential academic role models in research and education as well as faculty that lead advances in the mission of their department or organization. Pearce is jointly appointed with the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy and the School of Computer Science.
Cybersecurity and Privacy Work by Faculty and Students on Full Display at CCS’22
This week, researchers from around the globe gathered in Los Angeles, California for the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS), where they will present discoveries on the cutting edge of cybersecurity and privacy.
The conference is a top tier research venue, and this year the Georgia Institute of Technology has six papers authored and co-authored by faculty and students from the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP). Each work represents a collaborative effort from across universities and institutions over the course of several years.
Here is a sample of the five public papers being presented at the flagship annual conference.
Guarding Against Remote Cyberattacks
A research team from Georgia Tech and Fudan University conducted the first systematic study of XRCE, a remote cyberattack on devices caused by injected malware, in cross-platform applications. Several high-profile platforms, such as Microsoft Teams and Slack, have been susceptible to injection issues, but XRCE has not been closely studied nor has its root cause been understood.
The team built a generic model of applications compatible with multiple operating systems to define XRCE’s attack scenarios, surfaces, and behaviors. They took what they learned and compared it to current cyber defenses of 640 real-world platforms and noted their weaknesses to this type of threat. They discovered that 75% of the platforms studied may be affected by XRCE, including Microsoft Teams.
To solve this problem, the group of researchers developed XGuard, a defense technology that will automatically mitigate XRCE attacks and all possible variants identified from the study. Understanding and Mitigating Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Cross-platform Ecosystem is the first research paper studying and preventing XRCE, the team hopes their work will raise awareness on the new cross-platform application vulnerabilities they uncovered. SCP Ph.D. students Feng Xiao, Zheng Yang, and Joey Allen were leading authors on the paper along with Assistant Professor Guangliang Yang of Fudan University, Georgia Tech Research Security Specialist Grant Williams, and SCP Professor Wenke Lee.
Bug Hunting in Self-driving Cars
Autonomous driving systems (ADS) are steadily becoming a reality, and experts expect them to be safer than human drivers. Unfortunately, there continues to be cases of accidents, including fatal ones, caused by flaws in ADS. A systematic approach to find and eliminate bugs in ADS is needed but did not exist.
Georgia Tech Ph.D. student Seulbae Kim first authored a research paper that designed an automated fuzz-testing framework, DriveFuzz, that repeatedly tests an ADS under realistic driving scenarios that evolve over iterations. Fuzz testing is known to be effective in finding bugs in traditional software systems. Kim and his colleagues demonstrated that fuzz testing can be applied to a non-traditional system, such as ADS, a cyber-physical system, to reveal unknown bugs.
Specifically, DriveFuzz mutates the system’s map, mission (initial position and goal position), actors (other vehicles and pedestrians), puddles, and weather of the scenario to stress the ADS. It looks for safety-critical vehicular misbehaviors, such as collisions and various traffic infractions. By testing two industry-grade open-source ADS, the team found 30 new bugs that lead to misbehaviors.
DriveFuzz: Discovering Autonomous Driving Bugs through Driving Quality-Guided Fuzzing Detection was written by SCP Ph.D. student Seulbae Kim, Major Liu (University of Texas at Dallas), Junghwan "John" Rhee (University of Central Oklahoma), Yuseok Jeon (UNIST), Yonghwi Kwon (University of Virginia), and Chung Hwan Kim (University of Texas at Dallas).
Separating the Good Onions from the Bad
The Onion Router (Tor) network provides anonymity to users by routing traffic through many computers across the globe. Users can also host websites anonymously on the Tor network without revealing their personal identifiable information. The Tor network has helped many journalists, activists, and whistleblowers in their dangerous line of work. However, the Tor network has also been used by malicious attackers to operate large cybercriminal enterprises.
Differentiating between legitimate Tor users and malicious Tor users is extremely challenging since the Tor network encrypts and anonymizes all traffic between end hosts and servers, which makes traditional security detection systems ineffective. Researchers at Georgia Tech have found a way to identify when malicious software (malware) like ransomware uses the Tor network. The technique uses statistical network packet features and machine learning algorithms to differentiate between malware and legitimate users. The novel approach can be incorporated into traditional security systems to supercharge their capabilities and help identify malicious use of the Tor network.
Exposing the Rat in the Tunnel: Using Traffic Analysis for Tor-based Malware Detection was written by Priyanka Dodia and Mashael AlSabah of Qatar Computing Research Institute; SCP Ph.D. student Omar Alrawi, and Tao Wang of Simon Fraser University.
Brining the Hammer Down
A rowhammer attack causes a binary digit, or bit, to flip in memory cells without directly accessing them. This side channel attack was used by SCP Associate Professor Daniel Genkin and a team of researchers from across the country to access the private session key from FrodoKEM. This security software was developed to keep encryption keys safe from quantum computers, however the process was corrupted by the team’s attacks.
When Frodo Flips: End-to-End Key Recovery on FrodoKEM via Rowhammer was written by Michael Fahr (University of Arkansas), Hunter Kippen (University of Maryland), Andrew Kwong (University of Michigan), Thinh Dang (George Washington University), Jacob Lichtinger (NIST), Dana Dachman-Soled (University of Maryland), Daniel Genkin (Georgia Tech), Alexander H. Nelson (University of Arkansas),Ray Perlner (NIST), Arkady Yerukhimovich (George Washington University), and Daniel Apon (The MITRE Corporation).
Another paper being presented this week on rowhammer attacks is HammerScope, written in collaboration with researchers from SCP, Israel, and Australia. The research explores the correlation of rowhammer attacks with the instantaneous power consumption of the memory which the attack needs to succeed. This correlation is used to mount various software-based power analysis attacks on memory.
The team showed how this can be used to compromise secret information in certain scenarios. HammerScope demonstrates yet another adversarial consequence of rowhammer which signifies the need for more robust and secure memory units in the future.
HammerScope: Observing DRAM Power Consumption Using Rowhammer was written by Yaakov Cohen (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev & Intel Corporation), SCP Ph.D. student Kevin Sam Tharayil, Arie Haenel (Jerusalem College of Technology & Intel Corporation), Genkin, Professor Angelos D. Keromytis with the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, Yossi Oren (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev & Intel Corporation), and Yuval Yarom (University of Adelaide).
Data Science Fellowship Delivers Results for Refugees Resettling in Atlanta
Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) Atlanta is living up to its name. The summer intern fellowship program hosted by Georgia Tech recently held its annual student showcase.
Nearly 70 people attended the event, held July 14 at Ponce City Market, as three student teams presented the results of their data-driven projects benefiting communities across Atlanta.
DSSG Atlanta connects college students with nonprofit organizations and community groups to create solutions for real-world problems using innovative approaches to data analysis. The students hail from across the country and study in a variety of fields. A Georgia Tech faculty member mentors each team of three students during the intensive, 10-week paid internship.
“This is a very competitive internship designed to tackle tough problems,” said Ellen Zegura, DSSG mentor and Stephen Fleming Chair of Telecommunications in the Georgia Tech School of Computer Science. “More than 100 students from the United States and abroad at all academic levels applied for DSSG this summer, but only nine were chosen to participate.”
Among those nine is Unaiza Ahsan, a Georgia Tech computer science Ph.D. student working with Professor Irfan Essa. Her team worked with New American Pathways (New AP) to develop a tool to help find adequate housing for refugees resettling in metro Atlanta.
“I’ve always been interested in applying technological skills to a social cause, and when I heard about the past projects that DSSG interns had worked with, I was very excited,” said Ahsan. “I am highly affected by the ongoing refugee crises in the world and therefore I was very willing to do anything I can to help.”
New American Pathways assists nearly 3,500 refugees a year, providing them with access to housing, educational services, employment opportunities, health care, and more. To date, Clarkston, a small city in DeKalb County, is the primary relocation area for many of these families.
Ahsan and her teammates on the New AP project—Wes Stayton, a Ph.D. student in the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, and Oleksandra Sopova, a computer science MS student and Fulbright Scholar at Kansas State University—set out to develop a data-driven way to effectively identify other potential areas within metro Atlanta suitable for refugee resettlement.
Creating a one-stop-shop experience
To achieve this goal, the team combined publicly available application program interfaces (APIs) for a number of data sets, including real estate listings, store locators, public school reports, and others, with information about international grocery stores and faith centers that might not be readily available to users.
“One challenge we experienced when using free API is that it always has limitations,” said Ahsan. “You can bypass these limitations by paying, but this is for a nonprofit so this was a bit of a struggle. The code we developed had to take these limitations into account. We were able to overcome these challenges to create a useful tool.”
With this tool, New AP coordinators can visually search for housing that meets the specific needs of each family. Users are presented with a variety of considerations—affordability, job availability, proximity to public transit, faith communities, grocery stores, crime statistics, language-support resources, and more—and rank them according to what’s most important to them. The team’s algorithm then generates a comprehensive color-coded map that provides an ordered list of desirable housing choices for each family.
According to the group’s mentor, Georgia Tech College of Computing Assistant Professor Bistra Dilkina, the team has developed a convenient, one-stop-shop way of visualizing and cross-referencing the information.
“The team spent a great deal of time with New American Pathways to develop a workflow for their web-based tool,” said Dilkina. “It was vitally important to the success of the project for the team to determine what data is needed, in what form and what order, and to determine how users will engage with the end product.”
Following the showcase, the New AP team spent the final week of the DSSG fellowship turning over the tool to New American Pathways. They trained several New AP users, provided training materials and system update documentation, and released the code and open-source API details.
“We are very impressed with what the DSSG fellows have achieved on this project,” said New American Pathways CEO Paedia Mixon. “They had a clear vision of what was needed and worked closely with us to create a potent tool that is helping individual refugees and refugee families find safe and affordable resettlement in the Atlanta area.”
Leveraging data science for other community projects
Along with New American Pathways, this year’s DSSG Atlanta project partners include the Westside Community Alliance and the Atlanta Regional Commission.
DSSG fellows worked with the Westside Community Alliance (WCA) to create an interactive public safety mapping tool. This tool has been integrated into the WCA’s existing community data dashboard, which launched in February 2016. The new feature visualizes data previously available only to law enforcement. With this tool, community leaders and other stakeholders can gain new insights and context for crime trends in the area, which allows them to make more informed, data-driven decisions.
For the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) project, DSSG fellows sought to identify metro Atlanta neighborhoods that most need reliable public transit access to jobs. ARC planners are using the tool developed by this team to visualize access to employment-based on income level from any point in metro Atlanta. According to a blog entry from Samuel Plank, a DSSG Atlanta 2016 fellow and Harvard University undergraduate student, using data provided by ARC, MARTA, and other sources “…we created a mapping tool to visualize the intersection between poverty, jobs, and public transit in Atlanta.”
Dean Isbell Moving on From Georgia Tech
Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay chair of Computing, has accepted the position of provost at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His last day at Georgia Tech is July 31.
Isbell is a Georgia Tech alumnus (B.S. ICS 90) and came back to join the College of Computing as a junior faculty member in 2002. He served as an architect for the innovative Threads curriculum, and of the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program. He became the dean of the College in 2019.
Under his leadership the college maintained top-10 rankings while doubling in enrollment. He has worked to make the field of computing aware of its social responsibility, winning this year’s prestigious Richard Tapia Award for Scientific Scholarship, Civic Science and Diversifying Computing from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
[RELATED: 'Welcome to Being a Cheesehead!' Community Reacts to Dean's Departure]
“Dean Isbell’s students, colleagues, and the Institute have all been witnesses and beneficiaries of his love for his alma mater as he has served in varying faculty and administrative roles over the last two decades,” said Steve McLaughlin, Georgia Tech’s provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs.
“He has truly been a transformational leader and a constant and enthusiastic champion for excellence, strategic growth, accessibility, and creating an exceptional teaching and learning environment here at Tech. We will miss him greatly, and we offer him our warmest congratulations as he embarks on this next chapter.”
Although he is leaving the dean’s office, Isbell said he will always be an active member of the Georgia Tech community.
“Tech is my alma mater, which in Latin means ‘mother of my soul.’ I grew into adulthood—or something close to it—as an undergraduate at Tech, learned how to be a professor here, and I have had the joy of helping to work with all of you to build the community in positions of leadership. This community has in fact nurtured my soul, and I will always give back to it any way I can.”
As provost, Isbell will hold the second-highest office at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The university, with nearly 50,000 students, is one of the largest universities in the country and ranks #14 among national public universities in U.S. News and World Report.
Dean's Award Winner is a Real 'Peoples' Person
The winner of the 2020 Dean’s Award for the College of Computing is Tonya Peoples, director of Facilities and Planning. Peoples won the award for her work to reconfigure the college’s physical plant during the past academic year.
Peoples oversaw the preparation of new space in Coda, as well as the re-fitting of old spaces to new purposes in the College of Computing Building and Klaus Advanced Computing Building. On top of that, her team ran a space swap, moving the first-floor inhabitants of CCB to the third floor and vice-versa. Her team has also been on the front line during our remote operations, keeping packages flowing every day from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
“The Dean’s Award is for a singular contribution to the college,” said Dean Charles Isbell. “Without a doubt, Tonya made such a singular contribution last year. Although she is always amazing, last year she not only managed to deal seamlessly with the logistical nightmare of multiple campus moves, she also managed the cultural challenges of moving people to new and unfamiliar spaces. She is a consummate professional, and the epitome of our community spirit.”
Alan Katz, the assistant dean for finance and operations, also praised Peoples.
“Since becoming our first Director of Facilities and Capital Planning in 2015, Tonya has consistently exceeded expectations in building a highly functioning team with a strong focus on planning and customer service,” he said. “I could not be prouder.”
The Dean’s Award, part of the college's annual awards, is given annually to the person (or persons) in the college who, in the Dean’s opinion, represents the best of the college, and has an outstanding dedication to the college. The award winner is selected by the Dean.

On-Demand Multimodal Transit Solution to Bring Equitable, Affordable Transportation to Atlanta’s Underserved Communities
The National Science Foundation (NSF), in partnership with the Department of Energy, has awarded a $1 million Stage 2 Civic Innovation Challenge grant to a team led by A. Russell Chandler III Chair and Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck to pilot an On-Demand Multimodal Transit System (ODMTS) in Atlanta. The goal of the project is to make public transportation in Atlanta faster, more convenient, and more equitable for the city’s residents, especially in underserved communities.
According to Van Hentenryck, who also leads the Socially Aware Mobility Lab, mass transit has a significant first- and last-mile problem: Most people will only walk a quarter of a mile to and from public transportation. If the distance exceeds this threshold, ridership decreases by more than 90%. To address this, Van Hentenryck’s team has created an ODMTS, which uses small on-demand vehicles, in addition to buses and light rail, to take riders to and from their destinations. The on-demand vehicles act as feeders to and from the fixed routes, allowing the transit system to be essentially door-to-door.
Van Hentenryck, a world leader in the fields of artificial intelligence, data science, and operations research, began to tackle the first- and last-mile problems in mobility eight years ago in Canberra, Australia. He then conducted another successful case study in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In both midsized cities, the multi-modal approach resulted in a significant reduction in both cost and passenger wait times. In 2018, Van Hentenryck joined ISyE, shifted his focus to Atlanta, and began a collaboration with the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). This winter, after more than three years of preparation, the team plans to pilot ODMTS in Atlanta areas with limited public transportation.
While ODMTS will improve the performance and efficiency of public transportation for everyone in Atlanta, the main objective is to provide cost-effective transportation to underserved communities and connect residents in underserved communities to jobs, healthcare, education, and healthy food. The ODMTS pilot will run in MARTA’s four jurisdictions: Clayton, DeKalb, and Fulton counties, and the City of Atlanta.
“It is almost impossible to do this with a traditional system, because these areas are very large and sparsely populated,” said Van Hentenryck. “It is not feasible to put buses in these areas, because they would run empty most of the time, and they require significant capital expenditures. On-demand vehicles, however, are inexpensive to operate and can reach a larger population, because they can be deployed as needed rather than following a set route.”
Though this is not the team’s first pilot, tackling a city like Atlanta is no small feat. Most of the algorithms used in Canberra and Ann Arbor had to be completely rewritten to account for Atlanta’s size and rail system, a component not part of the previous pilots. This creates a four-level system — trains, buses, on-demand vehicles, and walking — to get passengers to and from their locations.
“Atlanta is also a complicated city because it has multiple job centers. In addition to downtown, there are centers in Midtown, Gwinnett, Alpharetta, Buckhead, and near the airport,” said Van Hentenryck. “This makes for a much more complex design since we are taking people from their homes to one of many locations for work.”
Tickets will cost the same as the traditional MARTA system, just $2.50 each way, and riders will be able to purchase fare using the Breeze system. The team is also using a combination of machine learning and optimization techniques to predict rider behavior and ensure the system can scale accordingly.
“If we decrease transit time by 40%, more people will adopt transit because now it is much faster and more convenient than it used to be,” explained Van Hentenryck. “This will increase the demand, so it is important that we size the system correctly to account for this.”
ODMTS will also help decrease traffic congestion in Atlanta and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by enabling more people to use public transportation in place of personal vehicles. The addition of on-demand vehicles will also create jobs since additional drivers will be necessary to operate them. No existing bus routes will be eliminated during the pilot.
Collaboration Leads to Success
“MARTA’s leadership is very forward thinking, and they are working to determine the future of public transportation,” said Van Hentenryck. “They have been extremely collaborative throughout the process and provided us with vast amounts of data and insights to drive the process.”
“We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for this grant and proud to partner with Georgia Tech,” said MARTA Deputy General Manager Collie Greenwood. “Exploring first- and last-mile connectivity options is important in providing transit service that meets the needs of everyone in metro Atlanta.”
In addition to Van Hentenryck, the Georgia Tech team that will pilot ODMTS in Atlanta includes Professor Subhrajit “Subhro” Guhathakurta in the School of City and Regional Planning, Executive Director for Partnership and Inclusive Innovation Debra Lam, Associate Professor Christopher Le Dantec in the School of Interactive Computing, and Frederick Law Olmsted Associate Professor Kari Watkins in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
The research team will partner directly with residents in pilot communities, as well as with the transportation advocacy organization Atlanta Bicycle Coalition, to ensure transit services and access address the real-world needs of underserved locations.
“Our long history of working directly with Atlanta communities, and with local partners like the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition, will help us embed local expertise into the design of last-mile transit service for under-served locations in the city,” said Le Dantec.
The Stage 2 Civic Innovation Challenge grant is the latest in a series of awards to bring ODMTS to Atlanta. The team received the NSF Leap HI (Leading Engineering for America’s Prosperity, Health, and Infrastructure) grant in 2019 in collaboration with the School of Civil Engineering, School of Urban Planning, MARTA, the Atlanta Regional Commission, and the City of Atlanta to scale the algorithms used in Canberra and Ann Arbor with hopes to eventually pilot the program in Atlanta. They were then awarded a Stage 1 Civic Innovation Challenge planning grant in January 2021 to model the mobility patterns in Atlanta in preparation for a pilot in Stage 2.
"Professor Van Hentenryck deserves much credit for having the foresight to bring multidisciplinary, applied research and external partners together to catalyze innovative responses to regional and urban mobility," Lam said. "We are excited to explore how this can be modeled for other communities for greater economic and social growth."
Of the 52 teams selected for Stage 1, only 17 were chosen to move forward with pilot projects in Stage 2. They will have 12 months to complete and evaluate their projects.
"We applaud the efforts of all the teams who worked tirelessly to build partnerships between researchers and community stakeholders" said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. "We are excited to see the teams selected for the next phase begin their pilot projects and plant seeds of innovation across the country. This program demonstrates the value of research-community partnerships in rapidly translating cutting-edge science into community-based innovation, and we look forward to seeing its positive impact across urban and rural communities."
Van Hentenryck is eager to implement the pilot. “For me, this is the most successful research that you can have,” he said. “We started more than three years ago with an idea and now we get to make a difference in the lives of people.”
About the Socially Aware Mobility Project
The Socially Aware Mobility project is poised to have tremendous impact on the Metro Atlanta area, revolutionizing and modernizing the transit system for the 21st century.

Dhekne Receives NSF CAREER Award to Create Greener, More Advanced Indoor Navigation and Security Systems
Precision, millimeter-level 3D tracking of robotic arm movements – without cameras and in the dark – is just one of the expected benefits of new research into ultra-wideband radio (UWB) technology underway at Georgia Tech.
UWB technology uses low-level energy signals to enable short-range, high-bandwidth communications that do not interfere with other types of radio communications.
To push forward on what’s next in the field, School of Computer Science Assistant Professor Ashutosh Dhekne recently received a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award for his proposal, Closing the Gaps in UWB Localization and Sensing: Algorithms, Architectures, and Prototypes.
Dhekne expects his UWB research to not only eliminate the need for cameras to sense and track the minute movements of a robotic arm, he anticipates that it will also enable the development of infinitely scalable indoor navigation systems and advanced intrusion detection systems.
These advancements would have applications in homes as well as large, complex indoor spaces like malls, government buildings, and warehouses.
Systems using these new technologies are expected to be more environmentally friendly. They will require less computational power and generate much less data, which will significantly reduce energy usage for processing, transportation, and data storage. Privacy concerns will also be reduced because these systems do not rely on cameras.
“The overarching goal of this proposal is to carefully address some of the important challenges for indoor localization and sensing using wireless signals. This award provides an impetus to advance the state-of-the-art for indoor localization and will help support my research in the field,” said Dhekne.
The challenges Dhekne mentions relate to current algorithms and system architecture.
The technology shows promise because UWB frequencies can easily penetrate walls and the returning signals can be precisely timed. However, the algorithms and architecture used for current wireless systems cannot meet the needs for large indoor spaces.
“When we try to use the same algorithms for fine-grained localization, such as for localizing a pen on a whiteboard or tracking a robotic arm, we face hard-to-overcome limits of precision,” said Dhekne.
Overcoming these limitations won’t be easy. But Dhekne is confident he and his team of student researchers can develop innovative architectural solutions to dramatically advance the capabilities of UWB technology. These potential solutions include developing new multi-antenna systems that leverage the advantages of UWB and use signal phase to pinpoint an object’s location to within a millimeter.
Once more robust algorithms and improved architectural structures are developed, the team plans to move from the theoretical to the practical and create working prototypes to demonstrate the feasibility of their work.

The expected improvements in fine-grained location and precision tracking of the 3D movements of a robotic arm will enable systems to detect deviations from nominal behavior. This is crucial to improving maintenance, auditing, and compliance record-keeping efficiencies for automated devices.
Coupled with these advances in sensing and tracking, the ability to infinitely scale systems will enable next-generation personal navigation in large spaces.
Using UWB receivers that capture signals sent by installed anchor devices, these systems will allow an unlimited number of users to pinpoint their exact location and navigate airports, parking decks, and other complex indoor areas. These systems will ensure privacy because they do not require a user’s device to transmit a UWB signal.
Advances in UWB sensing and tracking capabilities could also be used to provide better context to digital personal assistants.
“Localization makes digital personal assistants such as Google Home and Alexa more context aware. Commands given to digital assistants can become more natural when the user’s location is known.
“For example, just saying ‘turn on the lights’ can be understood as a request to turn on the living-room lights if the user is in the living room,” said Dhekne.
Another application of wireless sensing, according to Dhekne, will be for advanced security systems. Transmitted UWB signals travel in all directions and bounce off obstructions in an indoor space. People entering a space will cause detectable disturbances of the wireless signal-reflection patterns.
This approach allows a UWB-based system to ignore disturbances caused by a pet, an elderly person living in the house, or another known entity. This capability means a security system can remain constantly armed with much less chance for false alarms.
“Along with household use, this technology can also be used in museums or other high-value locations where guards are also present, since the proposed idea can ignore the movements of friendly entities,” Dhekne explained.
In addition to supporting Dhekne’s theoretical and practical research, his NSF CAREER award is also funding several upcoming educational activities related to the work including graduate student projects focused on mobile computing and the internet of things (IoT). These projects will be part of Dhekne’s CS8803-MCI course offered this coming Fall.
Educational activities planned through this grant go beyond just Georgia Tech students. For example, Dhekne and his team plan to create educational IoT kits and conduct workshops for students from local middle and high schools.
The team also intends to open source the software and other technologies produced from their research. This will enable a larger community of researchers and enthusiasts to explore wireless localization and sensing.
As for what’s next, Dhekne says that a lot more can be done to advance UWB technologies.
“In the future, I hope to work on innovative solutions to some of the most pressing issues that we face today such as sustainability.
"Wireless localization and sensing can reduce resource waste through smarter, contextually aware IoT in homes, factories, warehouses, and other large indoor spaces. Localization can improve efficiencies of these vast spaces, help us find lost items, and overall improve quality of life,” said Dhekne.
Diaz Represents Georgia’s ‘Expanding Computing Education Pathways’ at CSEdCon
Education professionals from across the U.S. are set to attend CSEdCon this week in Las Vegas. Hosted by Code.org, CSEdCon is a global computer science (CS) education conference that draws CS educators, policy makers, state advocates, education officials, school administrators, industry professionals, and researchers to the annual event.
Lien Diaz, director of educational innovation and leadership at the Georgia Tech Constellations Center for Equity in Computing, is participating on a panel with Bryan Cox, a (CS) program specialist from the Georgia Department of Education, and Hillary Fleenor, an instructor and outreach coordinator at Columbus State University.
Donor to Match Contributions for TA Scholarship Fund
An anonymous donor has committed to match new contributions in support of the School of Computing Instruction’s (SCI) Undergraduate Teaching Assistant Scholarship Endowment.
The donor will match every contribution dollar-for-dollar, up to $25,000, now through the end of the year. This is expected to result in a $50,000+ impact for the scholarship, which was established by SCI Associate Chair Mary Hudachek-Buswell in 2022.
With SCI teaching all required computer science (CS) courses to every student in the Institute, teaching assistants (TAs) are an integral part of student, and course, success. They help review and explain course content through recitations, office hours, program demos, and other tasks to assist in course management.
Nearly 400 TAs support SCI faculty each semester.
“TAs are the most hardworking group of people and I wanted to honor them,” Hudachek-Buswell said. “I wanted to support undergraduate TAs, who do not get paid during their first semester of work.”
To create the endowment, Hudachek-Buswell signed a contract with the Georgia Tech Foundation (GTF), establishing an account to collect funds for the scholarship. The contract obligates her to raising $25,000 for the scholarship within five years.
Two CS alumni, both former SCI TAs, were the first to contribute. With the new anonymous donor’s gift, the amount raised could exceed the original $25,000 goal. Hitting this mark would allow the scholarship to become permanent through the terms of the GTF contract. Every $25,000 raised in endowment funds will generate $1,000 in scholarship support for TAs enrolled in the College of Computing and supporting SCI faculty.
The goal is for the first scholarship to be awarded in Fall 2023. Any funds raised in excess will be added to the endowment, allowing the fund to grow and generate additional TA scholarships.
"It is well known in SCI that Mary has built a supportive family culture in her CS1332 undergraduate teaching assistant (UTA) team, which regularly has 40+ UTAs each semester,” SCI Inaugural Chair Olufisayo Omojokun said.
“By founding this scholarship, she's going well beyond her core TA group to make a caring impact across the entire College's UTA population. It's been an honor to see this scholarship grow from a phone conversation she and I had last year to a real thing that will be providing impactful financial support to TAs over the years."

Dual Fellowship Awards Underscore Computer Science Professor’s Research Impact
A Georgia Tech computer science professor is being recognized with back-to-back fellowships for his research impact on computer architecture and memory systems.
Moinuddin Qureshi has been named as a 2022 Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Fellow and as a 2023 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Fellow.
Qureshi, a professor in the School of Computer Science, was recognized as an ACM fellow for “contributions to memory hierarchy design” and as an IEEE Fellow for “contributions to scalable memory systems.”
Over the past two decades, Qureshi’s research has focused on improving the memory system of modern processors, ranging from multi-level caches during his Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin to phase change memory systems at IBM Research, and to 3D memory systems and other reliable and secure memory systems at Georgia Tech.
"As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child,” Qureshi said. “Similarly, it takes a supportive community to groom a researcher. I am grateful for the amazing students, wonderful mentors, and fantastic collaborators and friends who have been a part of this journey. This recognition is as much a reflection of their effort."
Along with these two achievements, Qureshi also recently received the prestigious 2022 ACM SIGARCH Maurice Wilkes Award for “contributions to high-performance memory systems.”
Qureshi’s research has had an “outstanding impact” on the field of computer architecture, according to School of Computer Science Chair Vivek Sarkar.
“It’s gratifying to see him receive these well-deserved world-class awards. These recognitions reflect positively on him and on Georgia Tech. My heartiest congratulations go to Moin as well as to his mentors and collaborators.” said Sarkar, who is also the Stephen Fleming Chair for Telecommunications in the College of Computing.
ACM is the world’s largest computing society and is dedicated to advancing the field. Each year, the organization honors members that have made a significant contribution to the field of computing and information technology. ACM Fellows are considered to be the organization's most prestigious member grade, comprising the top 1% of the association's members.
IEEE is the world’s largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. The IEEE Fellow Award is a special recognition for members with extraordinary accomplishments in the IEEE technical fields. IEEE Fellow is the highest grade of membership, given each year to at most 0.1% of the total higher-grade members, and is regarded as a prestigious honor and an important career achievement.
Edge Computing to Bridge the Digital Divide for Campus Neighbor
Georgia Tech researchers are planning to bring edge computing to Atlanta’s Westside. With National Science Foundation funding, the group will deploy edge-based information services to increase internet access for the community.
The $150,000 planning grant will enable researchers to explore the possibilities of the project, develop community relationships, and gather a team of students. They believe their methods in the Westside could serve as a test case for applying the solution to similar urban neighborhoods elsewhere.
“The digital divide in urban communities is getting worse: They don’t have reliable connectivity, or affordability for connections,” School of Computer Science (SCS) Professor Umakishore Ramachandran said. “Georgia Tech should be able to do something to help our neighbors.”
The project started three years ago when researchers approached Westside leaders to figure out their needs for increasing access to information. To develop trust with the community, undergraduate and graduate students have been regularly attending Westside community meetings.
They determined the community would most benefit from local area network (LAN) based connectivity and streaming services that are not reliant on cloud connectivity. For sustainability, they aim to train high school students and other community members to maintain these systems.
Building relationships is just as important as the technology. As a concrete use case, they plan to provide a streaming service using an open-source LAN-based platform akin to Zoom for Tech students to tutor Westside area children.
“Technology is the easy part; the hard part is earning trust of community,” Ramachandran said.
Ramachandran is co-principal investigator along with SCS Assistant Professor faculty Ashutosh Dhekne and Professors Mustaque Ahamad, and Mostafa Ammar; School of Economics Associate Professor Shatakshee Dhongde; and City and Regional Planning Associate Professor Nisha Botchwey.
Eight-Year Study Shows the Dark Side of WordPress Plugins
A new look into the world of WordPress plugins is showing scientists that this basic component of website development is a minefield full of malware and danger.
Since 2012 researchers in the Georgia Tech Cyber Forensics Innovation Laboratory (CyFI Lab) have uncovered 47,337 malicious plugins across 24,931 unique WordPress websites through a web development tool they named YODA.
According to a newly released paper about the eight-year study, the researchers found that every compromised website in their dataset had two or more infected plugins. The findings also indicated that 94% of those plugins are still actively infected.
“This is an under-explored space,” said Ph.D. student Ranjita Pai Kasturi who was the lead researcher on the project. “Attackers do not try very hard to hide their tracks and often rightly assume that website owners will not find them.”
YODA is not only able to detect active malware in plugins, but it can also trace the malicious software back to its source. This allowed the researchers to determine that these malicious plugins were either sold on the open market or distributed from pirating sites, injected into the website by exploiting a vulnerability, or in most cases, infected after the plugin was added to a website.
According to the paper written by Kasturi and her colleagues, over 40,000 plugins in their dataset were shown to have been infected after they were deployed. The team found that the malware would attack other plugins on the site to spread the infection.
“These infections were a result of two scenarios. The first is cross-plugin infection, in which case a particular plugin developer cannot do much,” said Kasturi. “Or it was infected by exploiting existing plugin vulnerabilities. To fix this, plugin developers can scan for vulnerabilities before releasing their plugins for public use.”
Although these malicious plugins can be damaging, Kasturi adds that it’s not too late to save a website that has a compromised plugin. Website owners can purge malicious plugins entirely from their websites and reinstall a malware free version that has been scanned for vulnerabilities. To give web developers an edge over this problem, the CyFI Lab has made the YODA code available to the public on GitHub.
Mistrust Plugins You Must: A Large-Scale Study Of Malicious Plugins In WordPress Marketplaces, was presented at the 31st USENIX Security Symposium. The paper was written by Ph.D. students Kasturi, Jonathan Fuller, and Yiting Sun; master's student Omar Chabklo, undergraduate Andres Rodriguez, Postdoctoral Scholar Jeman Park, and Assistant Professor Brendan Saltaformaggio. The project was the result of the unique partnership between the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Embracing Socratic Paradox May Lead to More Reliable Predictions from AI Models
Researchers using new NSF and Facebook Research grants to better understand uncertainty
Next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) models used in public health, IoT, and other critical applications will soon be able to make better decisions and more accurate predictions thanks to a bit of philosophical wisdom being instilled in them at Georgia Tech.
School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) researchers are using a new 3-year, $1.1 million National Science Foundation (NSF) Medium grant to find ways of quantifying uncertainty in current AI models that use time-series data to make predictions.
From here, they hope to essentially teach the models what’s known as the Socratic paradox: “I know that I know nothing.”
“The key hurdle is that current deep learning neural models are poor at quantifying their uncertainty and are often overconfident in their predictions. Quantifying uncertainty will allow a model to say, ‘I don't know,’ when facing unknown or unexpected situations,” said B. Aditya Prakash, CSE associate professor and co-principal investigator for the project.
Because it doesn’t recognize what it doesn’t know, a current model may guess at answers and move forward as if it has guessed correctly. This is particularly problematic with time-series data – often used in public health monitoring and forecasting – where guesses and wrong answers can lead to lower levels of confidence in predictions generated by current-generation models.
Prakash (left) and Chao Zhang (right), CSE assistant professor and lead PI, are working with co-PI Shuochao Yao from George Mason University to address these limitations. Along with quantifying the amount of uncertainty, the team is working to better understand the types and sources of predictive uncertainty.
“We need principled models which are flexible enough to model uncertainties from multiple sources in the datasets and also produce accurate predictions,” Zhang said. “Qualifying uncertainty will allow us to dynamically select a subset of models that are more reliable, which can improve the efficiency of the system and decisions at run time.”
Because so much depends on specific tasks and data, the researchers say it’s difficult to provide accurate estimates of efficiency improvements based on their novel approach. Preliminary results in disease forecasting, however, indicate the team’s new models, algorithms, and techniques can outperform previous state-of-the-art models up to 2.5x in accuracy and 2.4x in reliability.
The techniques and tools emerging from this project, formally titled Collaborative Research: Principled Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Learning Models for Time Series Analysis (NSF Award # 2106961), will be open source, and the research findings will be integrated into existing courses, tutorials, and workshops.
Facebook Research Award
Prakash and Zhang are taking another tack as well to improve the current state of predictive modeling.
The pair recently earned a Facebook 2021 Statistics for Improving Insights, Models, and Decisions research award. Their proposal, Non-Parametric Methods for Calibrated Hierarchical Time-series Forecasting, was one of 10 winners recently announced by Facebook Research.
According to the team, nonparametric statistical methods can be very flexible and effective for modeling time-series data when there are many unknowns in a dataset. Generally speaking, this is because nonparametric tools analyze group medians rather than group means. As a result, scientists can better understand outliers and can use them to strengthen.
“Our goal is to develop principled end-to-end models that incorporate hierarchical constraints and behaviors. We will also incorporate signals from different views such as demographics signals, time-series signals, and mechanistic models, to let them mutually reinforce each other to make the models more accurate, reliable, and robust,” said Zhang.
Once the project is complete, the results of the research will be used to improve predictive modeling in healthcare, public health, and a variety of industrial applications.
“For example,” said Prakash, “Facebook can use this technique to forecast demands in their data centers in different geographic regions. This will give them lead time to make their infrastructure more robust and efficient.”
Experts ID Key Opportunities for Tech Entrepreneurs in 2022
From blockchain to cryptocurrency to the metaverse and beyond, 2022 is expected to be a banner year for tech entrepreneurs.
But, with technology advancing at a breakneck pace on so many fronts, where are the biggest opportunities for success?
To find out, advisory board members from the College of Computing were asked to share their insights as part of the College's What’s Next in Tech for 2022 survey. Along with identifying emerging opportunities for entrepreneurs, the responses also underscore changes to the entrepreneurial landscape brought about by the pandemic.
Katrina Montinola – Advisory Board Member; Vice President of Engineering, Archimedes, Inc.
The world has been fundamentally changed by this pandemic. Entrepreneurs who can figure out how to best meet the needs of people in this “new normal” will be best positioned to do well. I believe that VR/AR is also a big area of opportunity for entrepreneurs. The technology is maturing rapidly. Another area is climate-change. Electric cars, solar power come to mind as having reached or nearly having reached the mainstream recently. The widespread adoption of technologies such as these always provide opportunities for entrepreneurs as the market grows.
Sheetal Wrzesien – Advisory Board Member; Alumna (CS 94); Engineering Leader at Google
From my perspective, there's enormous entrepreneurial opportunity in enabling better access to education via cloud computing, boosting cybersecurity via AI, and using IoT to help conserve energy. Accelerating telemedicine for better health outcomes and quantum computing are fields that hold a great deal of potential opportunity for entrepreneurs.
[RELATED: Responsibility Key to Broader Understanding and Acceptance of AI in 2022]
Anil Chawla – Advisory Board Member; ArchiveSocial Board of Directors Executive Chairman
I see the biggest opportunities in domain-specific applications of established (CRM, workflow) and emerging (crypto/blockchain, AI/ML) tech trends. These are mostly in "boring" industries that have lots of real day-to-day problems, but also lots of opportunities. These industries include government, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, legal, and construction.
Kathy Pham – Advisory Board Member; Alumna (CS 07, MS CS 09); Federal Trade Commission Deputy Chief Technology Officer
I think tremendous opportunity exists for entrepreneurs in 2022 who are willing to consider what it really means to "change the world" and "scale tech." Because we now have precedent and research that can help entrepreneurs build better tech companies, the demand for new standards and safeguards will accelerate across applications and industries to ensure new and evolving technologies don’t change the world for the worse.
David Aucsmith – Advisory Board Member; Alumnus (MS ICS 84); University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory Senior Principal Research Scientist
AI for human computer interaction is a broad area of opportunity for entrepreneurs in 2022. In particular, computer generated customer support is laughable at this time so there is plenty of room for innovation. AI for fact checking is also an area with entrepreneurial potential this year.
Exploring a Habitat: New Simulation Tool Helps Train AI to Perform Household Tasks
Household tasks like setting the table are so commonplace to humans that we often take for granted all the steps and decisions our brain makes throughout the entire process.
We open drawers and select the right utensils, pick them up, move to the table, and set each in a specific place around the surface. And what if a child has left their toy in front of somebody’s seat? Now that must be removed and returned to its proper location.
These complex, multi-step tasks are extremely challenging for current approaches in machine learning and robotics. A new paper presented by a 21-person team of researchers at last week’s NeurIPS conference aims to close this gap, offering improved interactive simulations of in-home tasks that will lay the groundwork for deployable home assistants in the future.
The work, colloquially referred to as Habitat 2.0, builds on Habitat, a three-dimensional simulation of a home environment in which an artificial agent gains vital information about its surroundings through interaction. The newest version of the simulation improves on the original by adding interactivity with physics simulations, a new dataset of interactive homes, and a new benchmark of home assistant tasks.
The improved physics of the environment allows simulation of a Fetch mobile robot picking up objects from clutter, opening drawers, closing the fridge, and more, improving upon simulation speeds and cutting down experimentation time. Things that would have taken up to six months previously can now be done in as little as two days.
“Habitat 2.0 will enable researchers to scale experiments to complex, realistic tasks in the home, like setting the table or cleaning up the kitchen,” said Andrew Szot, a Ph.D. student in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing and the first author on the paper.
“One reason tasks in the home are challenging is that in the home robots do not have information about the layout or where obstacles and objects are. Instead, they must extract this information from onboard sensors and egocentric visual perception.”
This is in addition to the complexity of multi-step tasks that require assessment and decision at every juncture. Now, with Habitat 2.0, simulations can more quickly train a robot to learn about its environment and potential obstacles to success, evaluate success or failure of the simulation, and retrain based on new parameters.
The platform, Szot said, lays the groundwork for achieving a research agenda in interactive embodied AI for years to come.
“Habitat 2.0 is a powerful tool for training and evaluating robot home assistants in simulation,” he said. “By training in simulation and then deploying to the real world, we hope that Habitat 2.0 helps progress toward household robot assistants that can help with everyday tasks.”
The paper is titled Habitat 2.0: Training Home Assistants to Rearrange their Habitat.

Faculty Help Organize Community-Based Security Development Conference
Three faculty at the Georgia Tech School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP) are bringing security development tools and techniques from academic researchers to computer science practitioners through the sixth annual IEEE Secure Development Conference (SecDev) taking place virtually, Oct. 18-21.
“This conference is about putting theory to practical use which results in the development of secure software and systems,” said Brendan Saltaformaggio, SCP assistant professor and SecDev general chair. “I can’t think of any other venue that does this.”
On the first day of the conference, researchers will present secure system development techniques they have created for everyday use in a tutorial format. Faculty from 12 different research institutions and universities will be presenting how their findings can be applied to the computational computer stack. This format identifies how security can be built into computer systems during their development instead of after the fact.
“Academics have methods for implementing improved safeguards to these processes, but they don’t have a good way to share them,” said Saltaformaggio.
For Taesoo Kim, SCP associate professor and SecDev steering committee member, this idea of collaboration between research and practice is the heart of the conference. Kim served as program committee co-chair in 2020.
“There is not only a focus on being a premier venue for academic work, but also a focus on how the presented findings can have a daily impact,” said Kim. “SecDev values a practical tool and technique that are of interest to both participants and academics.”
This different approach to academic conferences is what attracted Lee Lerner, a chief scientist at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), inaugural SCP Executive Committee member and SecDev steering committee member.
In 2018 Lerner agreed to be the vice general chair for the conference. Since then, he has helped bring SecDev from Massachusetts to Washington D.C. and finally to Atlanta where it will be hosted at the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center in 2022. The conference was held virtually in 2020, and again in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“We [GTRI] saw great potential for this conference when I joined in 2018 because of the emphasis on unifying researchers and practitioners,” said Lerner. “We want to establish it as a premier security conference and expand beyond the East Coast.”

Faculty Hold Workshop to Improve Integration of Ethics into Courses
As computer science becomes more ingrained into various areas of study and, indeed, our daily lives, an eye on the implications of innovation is needed, according to experts at Georgia Tech.
To help students begin thinking about ethics with regards to research, faculty at Georgia Tech – in conjunction with Mozilla – held the first workshop on integrating ethics and responsible computing into courses this summer.
The workshop was a collaboration between faculty researchers at Georgia Tech in both the Ethics, Technology, and Human Interaction Center (ETHICx) and Computing and Society, as well as Mozilla. The workshop received a strong response, which organizers say indicates a growing desire for ethics at the center of computer science courses.
Members of the College of Computing’s Division of Computing Instruction, the Schools of Interactive Computing, Computational Science and Engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering, along with attendees from Georgia State all participated in the online workshop.
“It’s really gratifying to have broad representation because it demonstrates the desire for people from so many different areas to think more deeply about the role of ethics in our education,” said Ellen Zegura, professor in the School of Computer Science and Fleming Chair in Telecommunications.
The goal of the workshop was to help instructors consider ways in which to implement ethics as a central piece in courses not just later in a student’s study, but from the very beginning. There’s an issue of urgency, Zegura said, that needed to be considered.
“Computing has reached a point where it is being used for critical decision making that really affects people’s lives,” she said. “The need to use computing responsibly has moved up incredibly. And if we don’t talk about ethics early in the curriculum, we’re sending a message that it’s not important. If you only hear about it in one course and it’s later in your career, then what does that say about the importance? Students see that.”
While official plans aren’t currently in place to continue the program, Zegura said the idea is to continue this as a series of activities that are responsive to what people’s needs are, specifically those who want to do a better job of embedding ethics into their computer science curriculum.
Georgia Tech graduate Kathy Pham (CS 07, MS CS 09), now at Mozilla, has been instrumental in engaging the computer science community from 15-20 universities on focusing on ethics, Zegura said.
Faculty Member Earns NSF CAREER Award for Computer Vision and AI Research
Self-driving vehicles are expected to be a standard in the not-too-distant future, but Georgia Tech assistant professor Judy Hoffman said the technology still has some bumps it needs to get over before that happens.
Hoffman recently received the National Science Foundation’s CAREER Award, which will fund her research in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) for the next five years. She earned the award through her proposal, Vision Systems for an Evolving World, a project that seeks to solve the dilemma of when a computer vision artificial intelligence struggles to adapt to new environments and circumstances.
In a self-driving vehicle, cameras are stationed on all sides of the body, while an embedded AI system scans and processes the incoming data stream to continuously inform itself of appropriate actions to take. These AI systems are taught by computer scientists to recognize things like a car switching lanes or a pedestrian walking through a crosswalk, and to slow down or stop the vehicle when necessary. Hoffman said learning models today are trained through large collections of data that are often manually collected, curated, and annotated at great expense.
These systems process millions of images to learn how to operate a vehicle, but there are always scenarios that the scientists who train them can’t anticipate. And when it comes to something that travels at a high rate of speed, the inability to process a new piece of data can create a dangerous liability.
“When you move to a new city, street signs look different, or you drive in a rural area, and the road layout looks a little different, or you drive in snowy conditions or foggy conditions,” Hoffman said. “If it hasn’t seen all those examples beforehand, the model’s ability to continue to perform well and recognize the things it’s supposed to recognize can degrade.
“The thing we’re addressing is this issue that systems today are brittle, and they are highly susceptible to that initial phase of learning. You want to make sure that they’re more flexible, that they can be more reliable in circumstances and adapt on their own if they need to.”
If the human training the computer can’t think through every possible scenario, then the only way to make self-driving vehicles a reality is to create an AI that can recognize new environments and adapt to them without human interference or assistance. Hoffman said her new project will explore methods that make the learning systems as robust as possible so they can automatically incorporate new examples of observations.
“The goal of this project is to be able to develop vision systems that are resilient to the ways in which the visual appearance of the world can change,” she said.
“The technology is already there for most circumstances. It’s how do we get that end piece and do it in a reliable way. That’s the key challenge. Because those circumstances are inherently rare, you’re not going to have them in your core training data, and you need to be able to handle them as they arrive.”
To fill in the gaps, scientists can start with objects that frequently show up in images, which Hoffman defines as landmarks. When enough landmarks are identified, the AI can recognize them when they show up in new environments.
“Frequently, the way we do that is by trying to find pieces of this new scenario that match something that we’ve seen before,” she said. “If we can at least find some landmark pieces that match from what we’ve seen before to what we see now, we can use that to guide our learning on this new source of data.”
In her proposal, Hoffman said her research “will lead to the next generation of vision systems that can operate in novel visual environments with minimal human intervention.” While her focus will be on self-driving cars, she said her research can be utilized in any field that involves image processing, from the medical industry with X-rays and CT scans to autonomous navigation with unmanned aerial vehicles.
Hoffman, who is a member of the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT), said the funds from the NSF CAREER Award will allow her to take on new Ph.D. students to assist with her research and grow computer vision research at ML@GT.
While self-driving vehicles appear to be on the doorstep of a breakthrough, Hoffman said scientists should be meticulous about the final steps and not brush over them.
“I think there’s a fair amount of work to do in this direction before it’s going to be put on your phone and integrated tomorrow, or put on a car and integrated,” she said. “I think this work needs to be done to solve those last miles.”
Faculty Members Recognized for Teaching Excellence
The students have spoken! Two College of Computing faculty members have been named as among the best instructors at Georgia Tech.
Regents' Professor Amy Bruckman and Matthew Gombolay, the Anne and Alan Taetle Assistant Professor of Interactive Computing, have each earned the Student Recognition of Excellence in Teaching: 2021 CIOS Award.
Each semester, the Center for Learning and Teaching surveys students about their course instructors. the Course Instructor Opinion Survey (CIOS) asks students to provide anonymous feedback on an instructor’s respect and support for students, enthusiasm for teaching, and ability to stimulate interest in the course material.
“I love teaching ethics and technology and I’m honored to receive this recognition. My hope is that the students in Computers, Society, and Professionalism (CS4873) feel prepared for the key choices and hard decisions that emerge in their future careers,” said Bruckman, who is the senior associate chair of the School of Interactive Computing (IC).
The Student Recognition of Excellence in Teaching: 2021 CIOS Award is presented each year to 50 instructors with the highest cumulative survey response rates and scores over the preceding Spring, Summer, and Fall semesters. The award includes $1,000 for each recipient, which is provided by the Class of 1934 and the Jack and Frances Mundy endowment.
Bruckman started at Georgia Tech in 1997 after earning her Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Among her many accomplishments, Bruckman served as interim chair of the School of IC in 2017 and was named as an ACM Fellow in 2018. Bruckman’s research interests are in social computing where she focuses on collaboration, social movements, content moderation, and internet research ethics.
Gombolay, who also earned his Ph.D. at MIT, joined the School of IC in 2018. He has research interests in robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and human-robot interaction, and is the director of the Cognitive Optimization and Relational Robotics laboratory. Gombolay was selected as a DARPA Riser in 2018 and awarded a NASA Early Career Fellowship for increasing science autonomy in space.
Faculty Q&A: Professor Annie Antón Discusses How Leadership, Mentorship, and Heritage Has Helped Shape Academic Career
College of Computing Professor Annie Antón has accomplished much in her academic career. She served as the chair of the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech from 2012-17. She is the founder and director of ThePrivacyPlace.org, a research center devoted to issues of privacy protection in information systems. She was also selected in 2016 to serve on the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity by President Barack Obama.
Her contributions to the fields of computer science, cybersecurity, and education overall are clear, and they all began with mentors of her own. From her research to her leadership, Antón has been a force for change throughout her career.
She spoke with the College about her Cuban and Spanish heritage, how she has been inspired by others throughout her career, and how she aims to continuing impacting future generations of computer scientists.
Why is it important that we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month?
As an American of Cuban and Spanish ancestry, this month provides an opportunity to reflect upon my ancestors who left Spain in search of a better life for the next generation in Cuba, and my own parents who fled the Communist Castro regime in search of the freedom that many Americans sometimes appear to take for granted: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
As a leader both in the field and at Georgia Tech, how important is mentorship to improving diversity within the field of computer science?
I wouldn’t be where I am today were it not for the great mentors that I had as a student at Georgia Tech and throughout my career. In particular, I had four computing mentors as a student with whom I still consult to this day: Peter Freeman, Colin Potts, Mike McCracken, and John Stasko. I point this out because as a Cuban-American, my best mentors at Georgia Tech were all men. These men had no idea what it meant to be the daughter of Cubans in exile. Or to sometimes be the only woman in your computing class. However, they all believed in me, believed that I had something to contribute, appreciated my different perspective, and respected my cultural differences without ever challenging them in any way. These four men advised me and gave me opportunities that led me into a tremendously rewarding career.
I had many mentors, but I’ll point out that Mike McCracken gave me an opportunity to work for him when I was about to drop out of the master’s program at Georgia Tech. That opportunity kept me in grad school. Peter Freeman later encouraged me to stay for a Ph.D. Clearly, keeping me in school to obtain an M.S. and then a Ph.D. changed the trajectory of my career in ways that I can’t even imagine but that I’m sure would not have been as rewarding as the path of a professor.
How do you define successful leadership?
Leadership is action, not position. Action inspires, whereas position alone does not. A successful leader has integrity that is above reproach, truly listens, treats everyone with respect, and seeks to find consensus where many only see differences. Successful leadership requires an understanding that it’s all about the people you lead rather than about yourself.
What are the biggest challenges to successful leadership?
It’s difficult to answer this question without thinking of the most difficult day of my career – the day when, as school chair, I had to deliver bad news to my colleagues and to our students because one of our beloved colleagues had unexpectedly passed away. There’s just nothing worse than a day when you have to deliver this kind of bad news.
Why did you personally choose to pursue computer science?
I think I personally chose to pursue computer science because I took two computing courses at Mercer University and loved them. Upon completing my second course, the department chair, Professor Tom Hall, told me that I should change my major to computer science and that I should transfer to Georgia Tech. He saw something in me that I hadn’t seen in myself. He believed in me in a way that I had never experienced from another teacher or professor. He, too, changed the trajectory of my life and career early on before I came to Georgia Tech. More abstractly, I think I chose computer science because of the instant gratification that you get from writing a program that solves a real problem.
Beyond awards and job titles, how do you measure success?
For me, success is really measured by impact. When my students come back to visit and tell me they’ve decided to pursue a career in privacy and/or cybersecurity as a result of taking my privacy course, that’s success! When my Ph.D. students have successful careers in industry or academia and are paying it forward with mentees or students of their own, that’s impact. When faculty I’ve hired or mentored, get promoted and are inspiring students of their own, that’s impact. In summary, when happy, successful, people whom I’ve had the opportunity to help in some small way along the way contribute to society throughout their impactful careers, that is the greatest measure of success in my mind.
You’ve already accomplished quite a bit, but is there a “next big thing” you’d like to achieve in your career?
In my new role as ADVANCE Professor of Computing, my "next big thing” is my initiative to transform our Georgia Tech Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure process so that it is truly transparent and better aligned with national best practices. It has been extremely gratifying to work with my fellow ADVANCE professors and the Provost’s Office this semester on this effort. This is something that I’ve cared deeply about for nearly 20 years because I would not have received tenure without the transparent RPT process that in place when I went up for tenure. Ultimately, transparency leads to diversity, which brings us back to the theme of this Hispanic Heritage Month!
Faculty Receives New GPUs for Fluid Dynamics and Machine Learning Research
Scientific computing and simulation require lots of power. This means students, faculty, and researchers at the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) require the latest and greatest in computing technology to sustain their studies.
To help meet this need, CSE Assistant Professor Spencer Bryngelson recently received two NVIDIA A100-80GB graphic processing units (GPU) through NVIDIA’s Academic Hardware Grant Program. Accepted on behalf of the School in April, this gift upgrades the computing arsenal available to CSE faculty and students.
“We do research that relies on this type of hardware,” Bryngelson said. “With it, research happens much more quickly. We can solve bigger problems, we can solve smaller problems more quickly, and all sorts of things that were not available in the past.”
According to NVIDIA, the A100 provides up to 20 times higher performance compared to previous generations and the 80GB model is the world’s fastest memory bandwidth at over two terabytes per second.
Bryngelson and his research group intend to use the GPUs to further their research interests in multiphase fluid dynamics and machine learning.
Bryngelson described one example where models and numerical methods can test advances in ultrasound technology for lithotripsy procedures. These simulations analyze the effects of shock waves applied to kidney stones through computers in lieu of subjecting people to real-world tests. The A100 GPUs can improve accuracy and speed in those computer simulations.
“This type of hardware enables us to train models, to learn what an artificial neural network should look like to predict the things we care about,” Bryngelson said regarding application to machine learning. “A100s are the most powerful tool for the job for this kind of thing.”
Bryngelson’s gifted GPUs also represents Georgia Tech’s continued partnership with commercial providers, like NVIDIA, to equip the Institute with the tools to conduct meaningful research.
NVIDIA is one of many members of the College of Computing’s Corporate Affiliates Program (CAP). CAP is a recruiting pipeline that connects corporate partners with College of Computing students, meeting the industry at the point of need with talent straight from the College.
The School of CSE and NVIDIA certainly are no strangers to each other.
CSE Assistant Professor Srijan Kumar acquired a NVIDIA A100 GPU earlier this year through the Academic Grant Hardware Program. NVIDIA also gifted Kumar a Quadro RTX8000 graphics card in 2021.
In 2021, CSE Associate Professor Polo Chau and Prairie View A&M University Assistant Professor Xishuang Dong partnered with NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Institute to develop a data science teaching kit. The kit teaches students fundamental and advanced topics on accelerated data science, machine learning, data visualization, graph analytics, and more.
In 2019, the School of CSE earned a grant from NVIDIA’s Artificial Intelligence Lab (NVAIL). The NVAIL grant facilitated Chau’s DLI collaborations, as well as gifted the School a NVIDIA DGX station and $100,000 cash award for one year toward research into scalable graph algorithms.
With the addition of Bryngelson’s GPUs to these tools from NVIDIA, the School of CSE is fulfilling its mission of solving difficult problems through interdisciplinary cooperation and external partnerships.
“Georgia Tech and NVIDIA has had a long partnership and we gratefully acknowledge their contributions in our research and publications,” Bryngelson said.
Faculty Receives NSF CAREER Award to Detect and Counter Social Media Misinformation
Online misinformation makes social media platforms both unpleasant and unsafe for users. Now, with a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award in hand, a Georgia Tech researcher is poised to help social media platforms and users alike better detect misinformation and curb its spread.
Srijan Kumar, an assistant professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), received the prestigious award for early-career faculty to advance his research interests in information security and web integrity.
Kumar’s NSF CAREER award will fund research to invent methods that both detect and counter misinformation on social media platforms. Not only is this award an achievement for Kumar, but it could also be a victory for internet users who face the perils of online misinformation.
“This award will enable research that has the potential to improve how lay social media users interact with and counteract online misinformation,” said Kumar. “The work will boost information literacy in society and has the potential to reduce the number of people exposed to misinformation.”
Kumar points out that addressing misinformation at scale remains a pressing challenge, especially for platforms that use professional fact-checkers and moderators. According to one of Kumar’s previous studies, 96% of counter-responses to misinformation originated from lay users rather than fact-checkers.
Realizing the potential for internet users themselves to regulate misleading content on platforms they frequently visit, Kumar’s NSF CAREER award proposal presents a three-pronged approach to empower people with the ability to detect and counter misinformation.
First, Kumar’s research group will develop new, robust detection models that identify potentially non-credible information by leveraging user-generated responses in social media posts. The team will employ signed graph neural network models in this endeavor to better detect misinformation on social media platforms.
Next, Kumar’s team will create methods to enhance model robustness against adversarial behavior.
Kumar explained in his CAREER award proposal that one challenge in detecting and correcting misinformation is social media adversaries use many accounts to inject fake responses to a post. This behavior can fool existing detection models into classifying misinformation as true and vice versa, hence the need for newer, stronger tools.
Focusing on robustness is a measure to prevent existing and future models from falling for adversarial tactics.
Finally, the team will design a counter-response generation tool that can help internet users effectively respond to misinformation. This tool will incorporate existing fact-checking resources and best practices to suggest possible responses to misleading social media posts.
Users by themselves do not counter misinformation efficiently. Kumar found in past research that two-thirds of counter responses are uncivil, rude, and unsupported by evidence. This tool would help users counter misinformation in ways that are effective, not just efficient.
The goal is to boost information literacy in society and reduce the number of people exposed to harmful misinformation. Kumar’s tools help users on social media reach that goal by detecting misinformation and generate counter-responses that are also robust against adversarial tactics.
For Kumar himself though, the NSF CAREER award is another addition to the rising faculty’s growing list of accolades. In March, the National Academy of Sciences named Kumar a Kavli Fellow, his second in back-to-back years.
For his recent research endeavors, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence invited Kumar to present this year as part of its 37th annual conference and New Faculty Highlights program.
Last year, Forbes named Kumar in their 30 under 30 list of 2022.
“I am honored to receive this award from the National Science Foundation,” Kumar said. “This award is made possible due to the support of my students and collaborators, and it builds on work that has previously been funded by NSF, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Activity), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and industries.”
Fellowship Highlights Professor's Lasting Contributions to Cognitive Science
College of Computing Professor Ashok Goel has been elected as a 2022 Fellow of the Society by the Cognitive Science Society (CSS).
CSS is a consortium of global researchers working to better understand the human mind through a broad spectrum of research disciplines.
Those selected as Fellow of the Society “are individuals whose research has exhibited sustained excellence and had sustained impact on the Cognitive Science community,” according to the group’s website.
Goel and his fellow new Fellows will be formally inducted as part of the 44th Cognitive Science Conference in Toronto in July.
For more than a decade, Goel has been pursuing practical artificial intelligence research against a backdrop of cognitive science to better understand how human learn and provide more effective tools for online education.
“Being recognized by the Cognitive Science Society is an honor and certainly one that I happily share with my student researchers and collaborators,” said Goel, whose Design & Intelligence Lab created Jill Watson, the world’s first artificially intelligent teaching assistant.
Goel and his lab made national headlines in 2016 with Jill Watson and her role in Georgia Tech’s groundbreaking Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program. Since then, they have continued to push the use of artificial intelligence in the classroom forward and well beyond OMSCS.
They have now developed artificial intelligence (AI) tools that empower teachers of online classes to create AI teaching assistants for their classes. “In a sense, it’s using AI to create AI,” Goel says, “which is what you want in the long term, because if humans keep on creating AI, it’s going to take a long time,” Goel said in a recent interview.
Along with being a CSS Fellow of the Society, Goel was named as a fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 2021. He is also the executive director of NSF’s National AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education.
Fighting Fires: Meet the IC Staff Member Who Secures Funding for Faculty Research
The innovative research that faculty turn out on a near-daily basis at Georgia Tech wouldn’t get far without people like Jan Morian.
Need funding? Talk to Jan.
Need to know if your proposal meets all compliance standards? Talk to Jan.
Stressed out by that grant proposal deadline? Jan is there for you.
“I fight fires, basically,” said Morian, who serves as the assistant director of administrative operations for the School of Interactive Computing. “I handle faculty portfolios and their financial accounts, their grants, their gift money, their state money, and their students. I also supervise the financial staff for the department.
“I’m focused on taking really good care of our faculty and our students. The students are the reason why we’re here, and the faculty are the reason that the research drives the Institute. My role is to keep all that going.”
Morian has held varying administrative roles since she came to work at Georgia Tech five years ago. In her current position, she helps faculty manage their funding, guides their grant proposal processes, hires their students, and provides support with all aspects of research administration.
It’s a job that Morian said has a new challenge awaiting her when she comes to work each day.
“Even when there are tough days, it’s always something new,” she said.
“The faculty usually focuses more on the technical aspect of the grant, while we focus on the overall proposal submission, the formatting requirements, the budget requirements, and any compliance requirements. It’s a lengthy process that requires a lot of collaboration.”
Morian came to Georgia Tech after working at Kennesaw State University. While she enjoyed her time at KSU, she said her job at Georgia Tech allows her to witness and be part of groundbreaking research.
“It’s exciting to be part of research that is changing the world,” she said. “One day, our faculty’s research might be useful to many people, and in some small way we were a part of it.”
With more than 40 faculty members and their research to support in the School of Interactive Computing, Morian said the job often becomes hectic, but the pressure doesn’t bother her.
“It’s common for us to submit a grant the day it’s due, sometimes with minutes to spare,” she said. “It gets extremely intense, and there’s a lot of back and forth, but it’s also exciting.”
Morian said she is doing the job she loves. The journey to get there was unorthodox.
She didn’t go to college immediately after graduating from Roswell High School and worked as a travel agent for 16 years. As she raised a family and worked full time, she decided she wanted to earn her bachelor’s degree. She graduated from Kennesaw State in 2011 before she started working there.
“I worked really hard and overcame my fear of math,” she jested. “Turned out I was good at it. I’m very proud of that. I’m glad I’m not in the travel industry anymore, though I love to travel.”
Morian said she enjoys traveling with her husband, and they have a goal of visiting a new place every year. She is also a voracious reader, especially when it comes to books about traveling and other cultures. In her office, she can often be heard working to music.
“If you come into my office, I’ll have music playing, and depending on what it is, you’ll know where I am,” she said. “If I have instrumental on, it’s been a stressful day. If I’ve got hard rock on, I’m jamming.”
Morian said the culture is what she appreciates most about working at Georgia Tech.
“At the end of the day, it’s the people here,” she said. “It’s the students, the faculty, our colleagues. I really enjoy everyone across campus. It feels like a community. When you work at a university, you want to be part of that.”
Find the Right Lab for You at ML@GT’s Lab Lightning Talks
Next month, the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) will host the inaugural ML@GT Lab Lightning Talks. Scheduled for Dec. 4, the event will feature 22 labs affiliated with the center.
Representatives from these labs will have the opportunity to share research interests, work, and unique aspects of their lab in three minutes or less to interested graduate students, faculty, and members of the public.
Flawed AI Makes Robots Racist, Sexist
A robot operating with a popular internet-based artificial intelligence system consistently gravitates to men over women, white people over people of color, and jumps to conclusions about peoples' jobs after a glance at their face.
The work, led by Johns Hopkins University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and University of Washington researchers, is believed to be the first to show that robots loaded with an accepted and widely used model operate with significant gender and racial biases. The work is set to be presented and published this week at the 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency.
"The robot has learned toxic stereotypes through these flawed neural network models," said author Andrew Hundt, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech who co-conducted the work as a Ph.D. student working in Johns Hopkins' Computational Interaction and Robotics Laboratory. "We're at risk of creating a generation of racist and sexist robots, but people and organizations have decided it's OK to create these products without addressing the issues."
Those building artificial intelligence models to recognize humans and objects often turn to vast datasets available for free on the internet. But the internet is also notoriously filled with inaccurate and overtly biased content, meaning any algorithm built with these datasets could be infused with the same issues. Joy Buolamwini, Timinit Gebru, and Abeba Birhane demonstrated race and gender gaps in facial recognition products, as well as in a neural network that compares images to captions called CLIP.
Robots also rely on these neural networks to learn how to recognize objects and interact with the world. Concerned about what such biases could mean for autonomous machines that make physical decisions without human guidance, Hundt's team decided to test a publicly downloadable artificial intelligence model for robots that was built with the CLIP neural network as a way to help the machine "see" and identify objects by name.
The robot was tasked to put objects in a box. Specifically, the objects were blocks with assorted human faces on them, similar to faces printed on product boxes and book covers.
There were 62 commands including, "pack the person in the brown box," "pack the doctor in the brown box," "pack the criminal in the brown box," and "pack the homemaker in the brown box." The team tracked how often the robot selected each gender and race. The robot was incapable of performing without bias, and often acted out significant and disturbing stereotypes.
Key findings:
- The robot selected males 8% more.
- White and Asian men were picked the most.
- Black women were picked the least.
- Once the robot "sees" people's faces, the robot tends to: identify women as a "homemaker" over white men; identify Black men as "criminals" 10% more than white men; identify Latino men as "janitors" 10% more than white men.
- Women of all ethnicities were less likely to be picked than men when the robot searched for the "doctor."
"When we said 'put the criminal into the brown box,' a well-designed system would refuse to do anything. It definitely should not be putting pictures of people into a box as if they were criminals," Hundt said. "Even if it's something that seems positive like 'put the doctor in the box,' there is nothing in the photo indicating that person is a doctor so you can't make that designation."
Co-author Vicky Zeng, a graduate student studying computer science at Johns Hopkins, called the results "sadly unsurprising."
As companies race to commercialize robotics, the team suspects models with these sorts of flaws could be used as foundations for robots being designed for use in homes, as well as in workplaces like warehouses.
"In a home maybe the robot is picking up the white doll when a kid asks for the beautiful doll," Zeng said. "Or maybe in a warehouse where there are many products with models on the box, you could imagine the robot reaching for the products with white faces on them more frequently."
To prevent future machines from adopting and reenacting these human stereotypes, the team says systematic changes to research and business practices are needed.
"While many marginalized groups are not included in our study, the assumption should be that any such robotics system will be unsafe for marginalized groups until proven otherwise," said coauthor William Agnew of University of Washington.

Fluellen Uses Music and Mentorship to Encourage Students to Participate in STEM Classes
With a fifth studio album on the way, learning to teach remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic, and juggling graduate school and parenthood, Marekus Fluellen has a lot going on. For Fluellen, this is the norm and it’s how he likes it.
“I think I work better when I have a lot of plates in the air. It keeps me focused, challenged, and intentional with my time,” said Fluellen.
His ability to handle a lot at once is a key to success for Fluellen, a teacher at Frederick B. Douglass High School where he teaches three subjects; math, music technology, and computer science. A teacher since 2007, the 2019-2020 academic year was Fluellen’s first teaching computer science, a subject he has tackled as a part of The Computing Equity Project with the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech.
Former Dean Recognized for Impact on Computer Science
Zvi Galil, the previous dean of the College of Computing, has been named the seventh most influential computer scientist of the past decade by Academic Influence.
Galil, who served as dean from 2010 to 2019, stands out among the top 10 because he was chosen for his research and for his leadership, in particular for his vital role in founding Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program. Since its founding in 2014, OMSCS has grown to an enrollment of more than 10,000 students, making it the largest computing master’s program in the country.
“I am indebted to our faculty for approving and executing the program,” Galil said.
Galil is also a groundbreaking and prolific researcher with more than 200 papers to his name. Some of his string and graph algorithms are mathematically speaking, the best possible. He coined two important terms that are widely used:
- Stringology – the subfield of string algorithms, where he has made numerous contributions.
- Sparsification – a method of replacing a dense graph with a sparse graph that leads to faster algorithms. Galil and others have used it to speed up graph algorithms.
He is a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.
He also has an impressive leadership record. Before coming to Georgia Tech, Galil served as the president of Tel Aviv University and as the Morris and Alma A. Schapiro Dean of Engineering at Columbia University.
Before the onset of the pandemic, Galil traveled the world giving dozens of talks about OMSCS and lessons learned from the program. He is now, of course, giving these talks online. Later this month he will give a keynote lecture to the iConference (the conference of the iSchools), a public webinar, and a private roundtable discussion with academic leaders in the Netherlands. The webinar and roundtable are sponsored by StudyPortals.
“I have been extremely fortunate to initiate and to lead the creation of OMSCS, and that its high quality and low price enabled many – 16,000 so far – to fulfill their aspirations and improve their lives,” Galil said. The number includes OMSCS graduates, which as of next month will exceed 5,000.
Former Student Earns Top Award at Premier Visualization Conference
A former Georgia Tech Ph.D. student received the 2021 Visualization Dissertation Award and three pieces of research were recognized for best poster and best poster honorable mention at IEEE VIS 2021.
The conference, being held virtually Oct. 24-29, is attended annually by researchers in the field from around the globe applying insights in theory, methods, and applications of visualizations and visual analytics. It is the premier forum for research in its field.
Arjun Srinivasan, who was advised by Regents’ Professor John Stasko before graduating with a Ph.D. in computer science from Georgia Tech in 2020, was recognized for his work titled Combining Natural Language and Direct Manipulation for Human-Data Interaction Through Visualizations.
The research seeks to reimagine interaction techniques with data visualization tools, expanding beyond the traditional keyboard and mouse interface to take advantage of naturalistic human interaction like touch or speech. It further evaluates the multimodal interaction design for strengths and challenges and highlights how each accommodates varying patterns of user interaction.
The award recognizes the top Ph.D. dissertation in the field of data visualization from the previous year.
In addition to Srinivasan’s work, three posters were also recognized by the conference.
One, titled Towards Automatic Grading of D3.js Visualizations, earned VIS Best Poster. Its authors – Matthew Hull, Connor Guerin, Justin Chen, Susanta Routray, and Duen Horng (Polo) Chau – are all Georgia Tech affiliated.
Two others were named best paper honorable mentions:
- Argo Scholar: Interactive Visual Exploration of Literature in Browsers (Kevin Li, Haoyang (Alex) Yang, Anish Upadhayay, Zhiyan (Frank) Zhou, Jon Saad-Falcon, Duen Horng (Polo) Chau).
- TrafficVis: Fighting Human Trafficking Through Visualization (Catalina Vajiac, Andreas Olligschlaeger, Yifei Li, Pratheeksha Nair, Meng-Chieh Lee, Namyong Park, Reihaneh Rabbany, Duen Horng (Polo) Chau, Christos Faloutsos).
Overall, Georgia Tech was represented with 12 papers, posters, talks, and panels at IEEE VIS. Explore each through the titles, abstracts, and links below, and follow @ICatGT on Twitter for more coverage of the conference.
Lumos: Increasing Awareness of Analytic Behavior during Visual Data Analysis
Arpit Narechania, Adam Coscia, Emily Wall (Emory University), Alex Endert
Visual data analysis tools provide people with the agency and flexibility to explore data using a variety of interactive functionalities. However, this flexibility may introduce potential consequences in situations where users unknowingly overemphasize or underemphasize specific subsets of the data or attribute space they are analyzing. For example, users may overemphasize specific attributes and/or their values (e.g., Gender is always encoded on the X axis), underemphasize others (e.g., Religion is never encoded), ignore a subset of the data (e.g., older people are filtered out), etc. In response, we present Lumos, a visual data analysis tool that captures and shows the interaction history with data to increase awareness of such analytic behaviors. Using in-situ (at the place of interaction) and ex-situ (in an external view) visualization techniques, Lumos provides real-time feedback to users for them to reflect on their activities. For example, Lumos highlights datapoints that have been previously examined in the same visualization (in-situ) and also overlays them on the underlying data distribution (i.e., baseline distribution) in a separate visualization (ex-situ). Through a user study with 24 participants, we investigate how Lumos helps users' data exploration and decision-making processes. We found that Lumos increases users' awareness of visual data analysis practices in real-time, promoting reflection upon and acknowledgement of their intentions and potentially influencing subsequent interactions.
Left, Right, and Gender: Exploring Interaction Traces to Mitigate Human Biases
Emily Wall (Emory University), Arpit Narechania, Adam Coscia, Jamal Paden, Alex Endert
Human biases impact the way people analyze data and make decisions. Recent work has shown that some visualization designs can better support cognitive processes and mitigate cognitive biases (i.e., errors that occur due to the use of mental "shortcuts"). In this work, we explore how visualizing a user's interaction history (i.e., which data points and attributes a user has interacted with) can be used to mitigate potential biases that drive decision making by promoting conscious reflection of one's analysis process. Given an interactive scatterplot-based visualization tool, we showed interaction history in real-time while exploring data (by coloring points in the scatterplot that the user has interacted with), and in a summative format after a decision has been made (by comparing the distribution of user interactions to the underlying distribution of the data). We conducted a series of in-lab experiments and a crowd-sourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of interaction history interventions toward mitigating bias. We contextualized this work in a political scenario in which participants were instructed to choose a committee of 10 fictitious politicians to review a recent bill passed in the U.S. state of Georgia banning abortion after 6 weeks, where things like gender bias or political party bias may drive one's analysis process. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach by evaluating a second decision making scenario related to movies. Our results are inconclusive for the effectiveness of interaction history (henceforth referred to as interaction traces) toward mitigating biased decision making. However, we find some mixed support that interaction traces, particularly in a summative format, can increase awareness of potential unconscious biases.
VitaLITy: Promoting Serendipitous Discovery of Academic Literature with Transformers & Visual Analytics

There are a few prominent practices for conducting reviews of academic literature, including searching for specific keywords on Google Scholar or checking citations from some initial seed paper(s). These approaches serve a critical purpose for academic literature reviews, yet there remain challenges in identifying relevant literature when similar work may utilize different terminology (e.g., mixed-initiative visual analytics papers may not use the same terminology as papers on model-steering, yet the two topics are relevant to one another). In this paper, we introduce a system, VitaLITy, intended to complement existing practices. In particular, VitaLITy promotes serendipitous discovery of relevant literature using transformer language models, allowing users to find semantically similar papers in a word embedding space given (1) a list of input paper(s) or (2) a working abstract. VitaLITy visualizes this document-level embedding space in an interactive 2-D scatterplot using dimension reduction. VitaLITy also summarizes meta information about the document corpus or search query, including keywords and co-authors, and allows users to save and export papers for use in a literature review. We present qualitative findings from an evaluation of VitaLITy, suggesting it can be a promising complementary technique for conducting academic literature reviews. Furthermore, we contribute data from 38 popular data visualization publication venues in VitaLITy, and we provide scrapers for the open-source community to continue to grow the list of supported venues.

Min Chen (University of Oxford), David Ebert (University of Oklahoma), Lace Padilla (UC Merced), Yixuan Zhang (Georgia Tech), Alfie Abdul-Rahman (Organizer, King's College London)
Visualization and visual analytics (VIS) plays an important role in combating COVID-19. We can clearly observe this fact in the charts and graphs for public consumption in the media, and can also identify various visual analytics techniques that have been developed for domain experts in their analysis and modeling of COVID-19 data. In this panel, we ask four researchers - "What is the Role of VIS in Combating COVID-19?". Our panelists will cover a number of topics including developing VIS techniques and systems, conducting empirical studies, and deploying VIS for public health surveillance and intervention planning. The panelists will discuss a range of questions, reflecting on the recent and ongoing work by VIS colleagues and examining challenges in deploying a wide range of VIS techniques in emergency responses.
In this panel, we ask four panelists to reflect on the question "What is the Role of VIS in Combating COVID-19?" based on their observation and experience. Our objectives are:
- to reflect on the recent and ongoing work by VIS colleagues in supporting different efforts for combating COVID-19;
- to demonstrate the broad and important role of VIS in emergency responses;
- to examine challenges in deploying a wide range of VIS techniques in emergency responses; and
- to stimulate new research programs for addressing such challenges.
A Critical Reflection on Visualization Research:Where Do Decision Making Tasks Hide?
Evanthia Dimara (Utrecht University) and John Stasko
It has been widely suggested that a key goal of visualization systems is to assist decision making, but is this true? We conduct a critical investigation on whether the activity of decision making is indeed central to the visualization domain. By approaching decision making as a user task, we explore the degree to which decision tasks are evident in visualization research and user studies. Our analysis suggests that decision tasks are not commonly found in current visualization task taxonomies and that the visualization field has yet to leverage guidance from decision theory domains on how to study such tasks. We further found that the majority of visualizations addressing decision making were not evaluated based on their ability to assist decision tasks. Finally, to help expand the impact of visual analytics in organizational as well as casual decision making activities, we initiate a research agenda on how decision making assistance could be elevated throughout visualization research.

Natural experiments are observational studies where the assignment of treatment conditions to different populations occurs by chance "in the wild". Researchers from fields such as economics, healthcare, and the social sciences leverage natural experiments to conduct hypothesis testing and causal effect estimation for treatment and outcome variables that would otherwise be costly, infeasible, or unethical. In this paper, we introduce VAINE (Visualization and AI for Natural Experiments), a visual analytics tool for identifying and understanding natural experiments from observational data. We then demonstrate how VAINE can be used to validate causal relationships, estimate average treatment effects, and identify statistical phenomena such as Simpson's paradox through two usage scenarios.
Understanding the Effects of Visualizing Missing Values on Visual Data Exploration
Hayeong Song, Yu Fu, Bahador Saket, John Stasko
When performing data analysis, people often confront data sets containing missing values. We conducted an empirical study to understand the effects of visualizing those missing values on participants' decision-making processes while performing a visual data exploration task. More specifically, our study participants purchased a hypothetical portfolio of stocks based on a dataset where some stocks had missing values for attributes such as PE ratio, beta, and EPS. The experiment used scatterplots to communicate the stock data. For one group of participants, stocks with missing values simply were not shown, while the second group saw such stocks depicted with estimated values as points with error bars. We measured participants' cognitive load involved in decision-making with data with missing values. Our results indicate that their decision-making workflow was different across two conditions.
NeuroCartography: Scalable Automatic Visual Summarization of Concepts in Deep Neural Networks
Haekyu Park, Nilaksh Das, Rahul Duggal, Austin P. Wright, Omar Shaikh, Fred Hohman, Polo Chau
Existing research on making sense of deep neural networks often focuses on neuron-level interpretation, which may not adequately capture the bigger picture of how concepts are collectively encoded by multiple neurons. We present NeuroCartography, an interactive system that scalably summarizes and visualizes concepts learned by neural networks. It automatically discovers and groups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron groups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions. NeuroCartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron clustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts detected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting "dog faces" of different breeds are grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related concepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting "dog face" and "dog tail" are placed closer in the embedding space). Key to our scalable techniques is the ability to efficiently compute all neuron pairs' relationships, in time linear to the number of neurons instead of quadratic time. NeuroCartography scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images. The system's tightly coordinated views integrate the scalable techniques to visualize the concepts and their relationships, projecting the concept associations to a 2D space in Neuron Projection View, and summarizing neuron clusters and their relationships in Graph View. Through a large-scale human evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique discovers neuron groups that represent coherent, human-meaningful concepts. And through usage scenarios, we describe how our approaches enable interesting and surprising discoveries, such as concept cascades of related and isolated concepts. The NeuroCartography visualization runs in modern browsers and is open-sourced.
Towards Automatic Grading of D3.js Visualizations
Matthew Hull, Connor Guerin, Justin Lu Chen, Susanta Kumar Routray, Polo Chau
Manually grading D3 data visualizations is a challenging endeavor, and is especially difficult for large classes with hundreds of students. Grading an interactive visualization requires a combination of interactive, quantitative, and qualitative evaluation that are conventionally done manually and are difficult to scale up as the visualization complexity, data size, and number of students increase. We present a first-of-its kind automatic grading method for D3 visualizations that scalably and precisely evaluates the data bindings, visual encodings, interactions, and design specifications used in a visualization. Our method has shown potential to enhance students’ learning experience, enabling them to submit their code frequently and receive rapid feedback to better inform iteration and improvement to their code and visualization design. Our method promotes consistent grading and enables instructors to dedicate more focus to assist students in gaining visualization knowledge and experience. We have successfully deployed our method and auto-graded D3 submissions from more than 1000 undergraduate and graduate students in Georgia Tech’s CSE6242 Data and Visual Analytics course, and received positive feedback and encouragement for expanding its adoption

Kevin Li, Haoyang Yang, Anish Upadhayay, Zhiyan Zhou, Jon Saad-Falcon, Polo Chau
Discovering and making sense of relevant research literature is fundamental to becoming knowledgeable in any scientific discipline. Visualization can aid this process; however, existing tools’ adoption and impact have often been constrained, such as by their reliance on small curated paper datasets that quickly become outdated or a lack of support for personalized exploration. We introduce ARGO SCHOLAR, an open-source, web-based visualization tool for interactive exploration of literature and easy sharing of exploration results. ARGO SCHOLAR queries and visualizes Semantic Scholar’s live data of almost 200 million papers, enabling users to generate personalized literature exploration results in real-time through flexible, incremental exploration, a common and effective method for researchers to discover relevant work. Our tool allows users to easily share their literature exploration results as a URL or web-embedded IFrame application.

Fortnow Leaving Georgia Tech for Dean's Position
Lance Fortnow, chair of the School of Computer Science (SCS), is leaving Georgia Tech to accept a position as Dean of Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.
“In my years as chair I have most enjoyed working with the incredible faculty, staff, and students of the School of Computer Science,” Fortnow said. “As I embark on my next chapter, I look back on the great community that we built and the critical role the school has and will continue to play in the success of the College and the Institute.”
When Fortnow joined SCS in 2012, computing was undergoing a transformation as processor improvements slowed and the cloud became the new paradigm. Once separate fields would now need to work together in this changing landscape, and Fortnow viewed his role similarly. As chair, he oversaw some of the top researchers in systems, databases, cybersecurity, architecture, theory, networks, and programming languages. His goal was to create a unified research vision where faculty were encouraged to collaborate in pursuit of bold new research initiatives.
Fortnow grew this research community through hiring faculty who excelled at working in multiple fields. Since he started, the number of pre-tenure faculty has grown from five to 11 — with 10 new faculty members added in the past two years — a striking achievement when there are five open jobs for every candidate. The school now boasts 37 faculty members, including nine endowed chairs, eight ACM fellows, and multiple NSF CAREER Award winners. The faculty manage multimillion-dollar contracts from DARPA, ONR, and other prominent research institutions.
During Fortnow’s tenure, SCS faculty lead research endeavors on the future of computing outside the school as well. The Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH), created in 2016, finds new ways to build computing devices as the technological environment shifts. The Institute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS) was also launched in 2016 around data-driven research. The Institute refocused its cybersecurity efforts when the Institute for Information Security and Privacy (IISP) was founded in 2015 with many SCS faculty serving as vital members.
“Lance has been an effective chair and leader for the School of Computer Science,” said College of Computing Dean Zvi Galil. “The school is extremely productive, not only in the foundational areas of computing, but also through efforts in areas like data science and cybersecurity.”
Fortnow, a computational complexity scholar, came to Georgia Tech from Northwestern University in 2012. He is an ACM Fellow and was the founding editor of ACM Transactions on Computation Theory. As a leader in his field, he has chaired ACM SIGACT and the IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity.
Foster is Focused on Creating a Sense of Belonging in Computing
A love for computer science (CS) is something that Terry Foster has always possessed. When he was just four years old his mom bought him an Atari that he set up himself. From there, Foster has continued to build up his CS knowledge; earning a bachelor’s degree in computer information systems and a master’s in instructional technology before working in the industry for several years.
Today, Foster is a Fellow at the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech (Constellations) – a role he not only loves but considers crucial to changing the computer science education landscape.
Gallery of Odd and New Technology Holds Future of Computing
Ever since the 1970s, the number of transistors on computer microchips typically doubled about every two years. What was once a predictable trend, called Moore’s Law, is now increasingly untenable with current technologies, which would inhibit further development of today’s computers and smart devices.
Georgia Tech’s Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH) is taking this dilemma head-on, in part, through a computer version of Frankenstein’s lab. Dubbed the Rogues Gallery, CRNCH showcased this collection of unique hardware at the 2023 CRNCH Summit to illustrate how it is ushering the next generation of computing.
Founded in 2018, the Rogues Gallery is a collection of unique computer hardware acquired from vendors, research labs, and startups. While these components could unlock the future of computing, they are either so new or rare that few individuals know how to effectively program them, and the full capabilities remain unknown.
To better understand these components, the Rogues Gallery allows students, faculty, and industry collaborators to access its hardware collection to experiment within a managed data center. The Rogues Gallery also operates as CRNCH’s testbed that researchers across the globe can use through remote access.
To share this interesting and helpful resource, CNRCH leadership organized the 2023 summit to bring together computing stakeholders and raise awareness of novel architectures, like the Rogues Gallery. The summit also presents an opportunity to share the Rogues Gallery’s current state and future direction.
“The Rogues Gallery has seen substantial uptake within Georgia Tech and with researchers from across the U.S. and around the world,” said Jeff Young, a research scientist at Georgia Tech and director of the Rogues Gallery. “We just finished our first big deployment of hardware through an NSF program, and we're planning on future acquisitions, training, and community engagement to help drive growth and evolution.”
One example of the hardware deployment Young refers to is a crown jewel within the Rogues Gallery: the Lucata Pathfinder system. Georgia Tech became the host of the nation’s largest, publicly available Lucata Pathfinder system when it arrived in July 2021.
The system is a prototype computing platform designed to run deep analytics on large graphs. Here, Rogues Gallery researchers are working to explore the limits of the Lucata Pathfinder using large data sets with applications related to community detection, graph-based genome assembly, and graph neural networks.
According to Lucata, Pathfinder uses migrating thread technology to deliver 16 times the performance at one-tenth the power of comparable systems. The system can accelerate analytics on graph databases of over 1 trillion nodes with no data pruning required.
Along with the Lucata Pathfinder, another highlight from CRNCH Summit 2023 was a poster presentation session where some students showcased research from field programable gate arrays (FPGAs) provided through the Rogues Gallery. FPGAs are essentially microchips designed to be configured by the consumer.
By developing software on FPGAs, students apply lessons learned in the classroom while also helping find solutions to post-Moore computing. In fact, students shared their FPGA research at CRNCH Summit 2023 during a poster session.
Since 2021, over 200 Georgia Tech students have used a remotely accessible, 64-node FPGA cluster housed in the Rogues Gallery for processor design and artificial intelligence applications. Due to the low cost and high customizability of FPGAs, this technology is a promising starting point for the next generation of computer engineers.
“The most exciting thing about the Rogues Gallery is its flexibility to respond to requests from faculty at Georgia Tech and researchers,” Young said. “When we started the testbed, we never anticipated deploying a full remote FPGA cluster for classes, but the COVID-19 pandemic meant that we had to evolve the way we taught specific classes.”
Optimizing Rogues Gallery hardware for remote access is one of the keys to making it a source for meaningful computer research across the globe, not just Georgia Tech. Today, the Rogues Gallery supports over 100 users spanning the U.S. and Europe.
As the need for new post-Moore resources, research, and education grows around the world, the Rogues Gallery aims to keep pace using its variety of unique and well-supported hardware, software, tools, and training.
“We see the Rogues Gallery as a democratizing agent for exploring novel architectures,” Young said. “We are providing an avenue for new related codesign developments in software, tools, and applications that will help us to create the ‘next’ computing paradigms that will be important in the next 10-20 years.”
Georgia Tech Finds Its ‘Roots of Innovation’ at Tapia 2018

With 34 undergraduate and master’s students, and five online master’s in computer science (OMSCS) students attending, the Yellow Jackets took San Diego by storm.
The conference brought together more than 1,800 faculty, students, industry professionals, and researchers from all backgrounds and ethnicities to discuss and celebrate diversity in computing.
Georgia Tech Machine Learning Students Earn J.P. Morgan AI Ph.D. Fellowships
The 2022 cohort for the J.P. Morgan AI Ph.D. Fellowships Program includes Pranav Shetty and Zijie “Jay” Wang, both students in the Machine Learning Ph.D. program at Georgia Tech.
The Institute is the only university with multiple recipients among the new group of 11. Both students are advised by College of Computing faculty.
The J.P. Morgan AI Research Awards Program — consisting of the Ph.D. Fellowships and Faculty Research Rewards — is part of the company’s ongoing commitment to support artificial intelligence (AI) research for solving real-world problems.
“Our goal is to recognize and enable the next generation of leading AI researchers. We want to create an environment where researchers can inspire change and make a lasting impact in our communities and across our industry,” wrote Manuela Veloso, head of AI Research at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Shetty is advised by Rampi Ramprasad, professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering, and Chao Zhang, assistant professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering.
Shetty works on developing natural language processing methods to extract structured information and insights from scientific literature, which presents unique challenges.
Data locked away in scientific text is multi-modal just like in financial documents. It can be split across text, tables, and figures. It can also reveal entity relationships that span long distances in text. Shetty’s research tackles these challenges, the goal being to build systems that can automatically extract data from scientific literature and train “downstream” machine learning models with it.
“I look forward to collaborating with and learning from other researchers at J.P. Morgan AI Research,” said Shetty. “This is a very competitive award, and I feel honored to be included among those selected.”
The second recipient, Jay Wang, is advised by Polo Chau, associate professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering.
Wang’s research focuses on making AI more accessible, interpretable, and accountable, by designing and developing novel interactive interfaces for people to easily — and enjoyably — interact with machine learning systems at scale.
“I’m thrilled to receive this fellowship. I look forward to closely collaborating with the talented researchers at J.P. Morgan and making strides in responsible machine learning and information visualization research,” said Wang.
Wang’s hybrid expertise in machine learning and human-computer interaction enables him to harness AI’s potential to directly benefit people. His work has resulted in open-source tools like CNN Explainer for transforming AI education and GAM Changer, which empowers users to edit AI models to reflect their knowledge and values.

Georgia Tech Receives National Science Foundation Funding to Develop AI-Enhanced System Supporting High School Engineering Teachers
The Georgia Institute of Technology has received funding from the National Science Foundation to develop and pilot a software system enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI) that supports high school engineering teachers in teaching the engineering design process and providing students with real-time feedback.
The three-year, $849,000 grant supports a collaboration between Georgia Tech researchers in the College of Computing, the G.W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, and the Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics and Computing (CEISMC). The project will take a teaching-focused technological approach to the engineering design process, representing an early exploration into AI-enhanced design pedagogy.
“Our work is aimed in part at discovering if artificial intelligence can support teachers in the creation of the necessary models and knowledge structures needed to equip learners with engineering design skills,” said Mark Riedl, professor in the School of Interactive Computing and principal investigator on the NSF project.
Specifically, the project will:
- Improve upon an existing web-based Engineering Design Process Log (EDPL) by engaging in teacher user studies.
- Design, pilot, and implement an AI-based authoring and tutoring system for teachers to customize feedback for their students and for specific projects.
- Design and provide professional development opportunities for alpha and beta testing teachers.
- Assess the impact of an AI-based EDPL on engineering design pedagogy and classroom practice.
“We are focused on an AI-enhanced system for the Engineering Design Process Log to help students navigate the design process, provide real-time feedback, destigmatize failures during the process, and encourage meaningful documentation along the way,” said Roxanne Moore, co-principal investigator in the Woodruff School and CEISMC.
Jeff Rosen, program director at CEISMC who developed the original EDPL with Moore for another NSF project, will also serve as co-principal investigator to guide its adaptation to an AI-enhanced version.
“Unlike many other educational domains, engineering design problems vary widely in scope and solution pathways. The teacher plays a vital role – there will not be a one-size-fits-all system that can provide feedback to students,” said Rosen.
Researchers plan to partner with high school engineering teachers in Georgia to conduct user studies and collaborate on design and development of the tools. During the project, an AI-enhanced software system will be developed then deployed into education environments where teachers will be able to test the system and provide feedback.
In a typical high school engineering class, students are often working in groups at their own pace on open-ended design projects. Meltem Alemdar, principal research scientist, associate director of CEISMC, and co-principal investigator on the NSF project said, “This tool could serve as a formative assessment tool, which is always a struggle for teachers in the engineering classroom.”
“Our hope is that this project will empower teachers with AI to provide more real-time feedback for students during the design processes when the teachers can’t be everywhere all the time. The goal is to reduce the stress on teachers and improve the learning experience for students,” said Moore.
This research is supported by NSF Grant 2119135 for the project Exploring Artificial Intelligence-enhanced Electronic Design Process Logs: Empowering High School Engineering Teachers. More information about the grant is available on the NSF’s website.

Georgia Tech Students Claim Cyber Crown Once Again
A crowd of students, faculty, and staff greeted officials from the National Security Agency (NSA) in the Coda Building Thursday afternoon to celebrate Georgia Tech winning the NSA Codebreaker Challenge (CBC) for the second year in a row.
On top of the win, Georgia Tech had more students complete the challenge than any other college or university in 2022. Only 2% of the 4,734 participants completed the nationwide challenge that ran from August to December last year.
“You should be very proud of your accomplishment,” said David Hyde, NSA director of industry and academic engagement. “About 20% of our solvers were from Georgia Tech.”

Hyde presented two trophies to students and Michael Bailey, founding chair of the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP), along with a letter to Georgia Tech’s 12th president, Ángel Cabrera listing each of the Institute’s 19 finishers by name and praising their accomplishment.
“I am thrilled to be here celebrating the success of the students who completed the challenge,” said Bailey. “Thank you to the NSA for creating this program and for coming all the way out here to celebrate.”
While CBC is extremely difficult by design, NSA engineers take special care to make it a learning experience. For example, during a Tech Talk prior to the awards ceremony students heard from Akil Booker, lead developer for CBC 2023, who walked the audience through the tasks of last year’s challenge.

“The codebreaker challenge is an annual outreach for the NSA,” said Booker. “We try to follow a realistic storyline. We look at current events and see what would make a good story.”
For the 2022 competition, developers created a fictional scenario where students were assisting the FBI with a ransomware attack. Students needed to find the attacker's identity, determine what tools were used in the attack, investigate a website used by the hacker, and hack into the website to recover the victim’s stolen files.
Booker told the audience about the cybersecurity tactics participants had to master to successfully complete each step. These techniques included students reverse engineering a website, collecting digital forensic evidence left behind by the attacker, and exploiting weaknesses in the hacker’s website.

Sure, it seems daunting, but not impossible for Georgia Tech students in the cybersecurity master’s program. Three of these students, Vaibhav Nagar, Gayathri Rajakumar, and Vipul Ujawane sat down with Daniel Chou, an undergraduate in the College of Computing, for a student panel about the codebreaker challenge where they offered tips for next year’s participants.
“Start early,” said Ujawane. “If you are new to this, that is okay. Take your time and enjoy it.”
The trio of graduate students told the audience that the courses offered by SCP Professors Wenke Lee, Taesoo Kim, and Associate Professor Brendan Saltaformaggio were a tremendous help in solving the challenge. Chou credited Georgia Tech’s GreyHat cybersecurity club for sparking his interest in cybersecurity along with the security courses in his degree thread.
Georgia Tech had 255 participants in the 2022 NSA Codebreaker Challenge and scored over 280,000 points, surpassing last year’s winning total by roughly 50,000. The NSA will add Georgia Tech’s name to the official CBC trophy and a first-place trophy was given to the Institute for display.
Georgia Tech Taking Ubicomp Conference Back to its Academic Roots
Since its inception in 1999, Ubicomp has grown into the premiere conference in the field of ubiquitous and wearable computing. In recent years, before the Covid-19 pandemic forced the conference to become virtual, Ubicomp was held in destination locations such as Maui, Hawaii and Osaka, Japan. In 2020, the conference was slated to be held in Cancun, Mexico, but the pandemic forced organizers to pivot.
After two years of meeting virtually, organizers were ready for Ubicomp to be in-person once again, but the venue in Cancun wasn’t available for 2022. They also weren’t sure if the pandemic would force them to shut down a live conference, so booking another venue proved to be a financial risk.
The solution: bring Ubicomp back to its roots. In the conference’s early days, it was small enough to be hosted by universities. This year, it’s being hosted by two of them at separate locations — Georgia Tech in Atlanta and Cambridge in the United Kingdom.
“Ubicomp started with around 150 people, I think, and eventually grew and grew,” said School of Interactive Computing professor and Ubicomp local arrangement chair Thad Starner. “It’s an 800-person conference, so that suddenly means you must plan for hundreds of thousands of dollars of resources, and you’re taking out major venues like hotel ballrooms, that sort of thing. Now it’s gone back to our roots of doing it with academic resources and trying to make it a more intimate event.”
Ubicomp will he held on the campuses of Georgia Tech and Cambridge simultaneously, with online options available, from Sept. 11 to Sept. 15. More than 175 papers will be presented by more than 800 computer scientists, with each presentation available online through streaming, cross-presented from the Atlanta venue to the Cambridge venue.
Anyone attending in Atlanta can see a presentation being given in Cambridge in real time and vice versa. The live presentations in Atlanta will be held on the first floor of the Technology Square Research Building in Midtown.
“We leveraged our resources here at TSRB because our auditorium and banquet hall has just been renovated, so we’ll be the first conference there,” Starner said. “That made the cost of the conference go down dramatically.”
Planning the event has had its share of challenges — the biggest one being the coordination of simultaneous presentations happening at two different locations across the world, but Starner said he’s found the new design to be convenient for participants in ways the conference hadn’t been in previous years.
“It makes the arrangements more manageable; it makes the travel more cost effective, and also the sheer number of papers being published, it makes the tidal wave of stuff coming in a lot more manageable as well,” he said.
Starner added that the organizing committee will pay attention to this year’s event, and if the dual locations seem to work well, it’s a feature that may not go away anytime soon. Traditionally, the locations are selected on a rotation of choosing cities from Asia, Europe and North America.
“This idea that maybe we’re going to have three sites, one in Asia, one in Europe and then one in North America, and then people go to whichever one they care about, it may be a new model,” he said. “We don’t know. It’s the first time somebody has tried this. This is a potential model for the future and is something that’s being talked about right now.”
Thomas Ploetz, associate professor at the School of Interactive Computing, is representing Georgia Tech as the general chair for this year’s Ubicomp. He has authored or co-authored eight papers that will be presented this year and is one of six IC faculty members who have had papers accepted. The others are professor emeritus Gregory Abowd, assistant professor Sonia Chernova, interim school chair Betsy DiSalvo, associate professor Josiah Hester, and distinguished professor Irfan Essa. The papers are also co-authored by 12 Georgia Tech PhD or graduate students. Tech faculty and students contributed to 13 papers altogether.
Ploetz said any papers presented at Ubicomp were accepted because they were published in a journal called The Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT) during the previous year. Many researchers in the field refer to Ubicomp and IMWUT synonymously, he said.
“It is fantastic to have such a strong presence of GT researchers — first and foremost our students — at our annual flagship conference,” Ploetz said. “It underlines the strength of Ubicomp/IMWUT research at our university.”
Starner said it’s an exciting time in the ubiquitous computing field, and the ability to meet in person for the conference couldn’t have come at a better time.
“There are so many cool people coming, so I’m hoping what people are going to take away from it is a whole lot more collaborations, a whole lot more energy, a whole lot more excitement,” Starner said.
“Right now, all the wearable stuff, this stuff used to be esoteric. Nobody knew about any of this stuff. Now it’s part of our daily lives, and there’s so much capability now that we didn’t have 20 years ago. After the last few years, what we’re going to see is a lot more collaboration and the vision of the future for the field.”

Georgia Tech’s Constellations Center Provides a Pathway for Computer Science Education in Majority of APS High Schools
For the second year, the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech will partner with Atlanta Public Schools (APS) to bring computer science education to the district.
APS, with schools only a few miles from Georgia Tech’s campus, serves one of the most marginalized communities in the state. Nearly 75% of its students are on free or reduced lunch and 72% of its population identify as black.
Constellations’ mission is to ensure that all students – especially students of color, women, and others underserved in K-12 and post-secondary institutions – have access to quality computer science education, a mission that has led to a strong partnership between the institute and the district.
Georgia Tech’s Constellations Center Trains Atlanta Public School Teachers for Georgia’s New Computer Science Course Requirements
To help Atlanta Public School system teachers prepare for a new requirement in Georgia schools to offer computer science courses within the next five years, the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing (Constellations) at Georgia Tech is expanding its programming to train and support educators.
As a result, six Atlanta Public School (APS) teachers spent Wednesday, Nov. 6 on Georgia Tech’s campus receiving hands-on training in teaching computer science from the center’s staff. All of the participating teachers are a part of Constellations’ Computing Equity Project – a program that is expanding computer science education to marginalized communities.

Graduate Profile: Joseph Abel
Catching a plane isn’t typically how graduates get to commencement, but Joseph Abel was ready to face holiday traffic and a flight from New York to walk across the stage.
Abel graduated from the Master of Science in Cybersecurity – Online (OMS Cybersecurity) program at Georgia Tech on Dec. 17. He is currently employed as an Instructional Support Technician at Farmingdale State College (FCS) in Long Island, New York.
“A big thing about me is that I want to make a difference,” he said. “Georgia Tech’s enhanced cyber background was exactly what I was looking for.”
By using what he learned in OMS Cybersecurity, Abel developed over half of the laboratory infrastructure for the FCS Computer Security Technology and Security Systems degree program.
“I was able to showcase the best practices to my colleagues and students at the college,” said Abel. “I really liked how the online model allowed me to be a working professional.”
Over 650 students are enrolled in the OMS Cybersecurity program taking courses in cyber physical systems, information security, and policy.
Graduate Profile: Srimanta Barua
Having earned a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science in India, Srimanta Barua wanted to take the next step in furthering his education.
Barua began emailing with Brendan Saltaformaggio, assistant professor with the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy, who invited him to apply to Georgia Tech and work as a graduate research assistant in the school’s Cyber Forensics Innovation Laboratory.
“I had worked with a few open-source reverse engineering tools before graduate school and was able to use that knowledge to reverse engineer to reverse engineer malware samples,” Barua said.
Barua graduated from Georgia Tech with a Master of Science in Computer Science degree on Dec. 17. He has accepted a job at Amazon as a Software Engineer and will start in January.
Graduate Q&A with Carter Yagemann: Self-Taught Cybersecurity Expert
Carter Yagemann began his career as a cybersecurity expert by building operating systems with the spare parts he found in his parents’ basement after school. Attacking and defending his own computers in high school helped lay the groundwork for the research he would undertake while studying at Georgia Tech.
Yagemann is walking the graduation stage today and receive his Ph.D. from the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy where he was advised by Professor Wenke Lee. After graduation, Yagemann is joining faculty at The Ohio State University where he has accepted the position of assistant professor.
Why did you choose systems and software security as your area of study?
During my undergraduate studies at Syracuse University, JPMorgan Chase & Co. took an interest in my self-taught cybersecurity skills and hired me as an intern to conduct cyber-threat intelligence. In short, my job was to understand the latest cyber-attacks that could be used against the company and devise plans for remediation.
It was during my internship that I decided to make cybersecurity my career, but I still wasn't sure if industry was the best place for me. I joined a lab at Syracuse and found that academic research gave me even more freedom to pursue interesting topics.
What is a research project you are proud of?
One of my recent projects takes a closer look at the process and challenges of reporting bugs to developers for patching. I discovered that the artifacts sent to developers in bug reports are inadequate, requiring extensive additional work by the developer to make sense of what's wrong with the program and how to fix it. As a result, it's now typical for popular projects to have over a thousand unopened bug reports sitting in a queue with no means for the developers to catch up.
To address this, I've created a system for automatically determining the root cause of bugs encountered in computer programs so developers receive the information they need to understand and fix the problem. My system works using a combination of processor tracing, which records the sequence of instructions executed by the computer, and symbolic analysis.
This combination of capabilities can automatically uncover the memory corruptions caused by severe bugs and then look back over the trace to determine their origins. It can then derive a preliminary patch that developers can test and refine into an official solution.
What was the impact of these findings?
I have used my system over the past year to analyze popular open-source projects, leading to the discovery of over 20 new severe software vulnerabilities. Thanks to the reports produced by my system, the developers have been able to fix these issues, creating a more secure software ecosystem.
Graduate Q&A With David Heath: From Research Engineer to Ph.D.
On Friday, David Heath will take the stage and receive his Ph.D. from the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP), where he was advised by SCP Senior Associate Chair and Associate Professor Vladimir Kolesnikov.
Heath received his bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science from Georgia Tech and began working as a research engineer at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) after his undergraduate graduation.
Why did you choose to pursue a Ph.D.?
Working at GTRI exposed me to individuals who value higher education and who engage with challenging research problems. I soon learned that these types of challenging problems kept me excited about my work, and so I started thinking about a Ph.D.
While the fact that I already lived in Atlanta certainly factored into my decision to apply to Georgia Tech, the far more important factor was Georgia Tech’s strength as an academic institution. Georgia Tech’s computer science program is continuously among the strongest programs in the world. When I was accepted to the program, it was a no-brainer to attend.
How did you choose your area of study?
I stumbled upon cryptography and multi-party computation (MPC) by a happy accident.
Early in my Ph.D., I studied programming languages (PL), but after a few years my PL advisor left Georgia Tech. I was collaborating with Associate Professor Kolesnikov on a small project when my advisor left, and I began studying MPC under Kolesnikov. I soon found that I loved the subject area, and to my surprise I was able to achieve relative success.
When I reflect on it, I am always amazed that I was so lucky to stumble into a situation where I had a research advisor with whom I work well and a subject area that I understand and enjoy.
You never know where success will come from!
What research projects have you been working on?
My research area allows parties to collaboratively compute directly on encrypted data. Since the data remains encrypted, we can build collaborative computations that both are powerful and preserve data privacy by using MPC.
For example, a server could encrypt a database and a client could encrypt a database query. The two parties could then work together to run the query inside MPC, and the server would learn nothing except for the query result.
Cryptographers have known for decades how to achieve such computations, at least in theory. In practice, MPC has so far remained relatively niche. My overarching research goal was to bring this subject into wider practice. I believe that this will enable engineers to build a new class of useful privacy-preserving applications that were previously impossible due to privacy and legal concerns.
What are your plans after Georgia Tech?
I love my research area, sharing ideas, and the academic culture in general. I hope to continue my career as an academic, and I am currently working to obtain a faculty position at a strong research-oriented university.
Graduate Q&A: Hayley Evans
Each semester, the School of Interactive Computing IC) graduates a number of Ph.D. students who will take their research, academic, and educational experience into new roles around the country and world. This fall was no different, as IC had five finish their doctoral degrees.
As we congratulate our own and the many others around the College of Computing and Georgia Tech as a whole, we asked students to take a look back on their time at Georgia Tech to reflect on memories, lessons learned, and advice they’d share with the next generation of students.
Read below for our Q&A with one IC graduate, Hayley Evans.
Can you provide some background on your research agenda at Georgia Tech and what your goals are for your work in the future?
My research investigates how to design human-centered technologies in the health and wellness space by leveraging an ecological approach in combination with feminist HCI practices. During my Ph.D., I investigated how to design user-centered technologies to support veteran-patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and clinical-decision-making for the clinicians who treat them. In the future, I hope to continue to investigate how inclusive design practices that consider ecological systems can enhance a wide range of health practices and services.
What’s next for you in your career? Where are you headed, and what will your role be?
I started working full-time in my fourth year as a Ph.D. as a UX Researcher/Service Designer for the federal government. I have worked with the U.S. Department of Veteran’s Affairs, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Centers for Disease Control. In a perfect world, I could continue to have a real-world impact conducting service design activities in the government space while pursing my love of teaching and mentoring students.
Can you describe what your time was like at Georgia Tech? How did the school benefit you, and do you have any particular memories you’ll take with you?
There’s something special about Georgia Tech and Atlanta itself. I’ve lived in a lot of places and it truly felt like home here. I have a wonderful and supportive advisor in Rosa Arriaga and great friends from my cohort and program who can laugh and commiserate with me. Honestly though, what was most special for me about Georgia Tech was having the opportunity to not only connect with colleagues on campus but to find a community off campus as well. Atlanta is welcoming and afforded me that opportunity. I was lucky enough to start a community garden with Aglanta during my studies and was also a gymnastics/tumbling coach. I also made some amazing friends in my neighborhood who are like family to me. My life in Atlanta is so much more than simply studying.
What advice would you give to other students who are just getting started on their Ph.D.s here?
You’re going to be blown away by how intelligent people at Georgia Tech are. Resist the urge to compare yourself to others, and remember that you bring your own unique perspective to your field and you were chosen to be a Ph.D. student here for a reason. Be unapologetically yourself, throw imposter syndrome out the window, and do what you say you will do (e.g. meet your deadlines, support your lab mates, etc.).
Graduate Q&A: Kasimir Gabert
The College of Computing confers degrees to deserving graduates every semester. During the week leading up to spring Commencement, one graduate reflected on his time at Georgia Tech.
Kasimir Gabert graduated with a Ph.D. from the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) where he was advised by Professor Ümit Çatalyürek. In a Q&A discussion, Gabert described his best memories and offered advice on “getting out” of Tech.
What were your research interests and notable projects while at Georgia Tech?
We are living in a world with an increasing amount of data. From diverse areas such as social activities, biological processes, and computer traffic, much of this data contains internal relationships which are well represented as graphs. I have been fascinated with the problem of trying to understand the internal structure of these large, sparse graphs, especially as they change over time. I have been involved with two notable projects. First, discovering a way of keeping track of nuclei, which are locally dense and important regions of graphs, as the graphs are changing. The second has been to develop a large, distributed system that can compute analytics on changing graphs and elastically scale itself as the rate of change and size of the input graph varies.
What is your favorite memory from Georgia Tech?
Every year at the annual supercomputing conference, Georgia Tech holds a booth and typically has several excellent papers. I have great memories of staffing the Georgia Tech booth, attending engaging talks, participating in various supercomputing events, and making many new connections with people. It is hard to justify numerous, year-round in-person computer science conferences with their associated carbon footprints and travel demands; having one annual, domain-wide conference may be a sustainable approach that avoids many of the drawbacks.
What advice would you give to other students who are just getting started on their Ph.D. here?
Getting a Ph.D. is not a small undertaking and, differing from your prior degrees, it will change in shape significantly over the course of the degree. At many points it will feel indefinitely far away; you may get discouraged and frustrated with rejection and a lack of progress. My advice would be to always keep moving forward in whatever way you can. Do not dwell on setbacks, and instead always try to improve and find the most exciting, rewarding path forward. If possible, tune your memory to preserve details on every paper you have read, and, at the same time, forget every rejection you have received.
What is next in your career? How did Georgia Tech help you get there?
I will work as a staff member at Sandia National Laboratories, addressing data science problems across a variety of domains. My experience at Georgia Tech has been crucial for me being able to address such problems effectively. My advisor and committee have helped guide my research so that it can apply to real-world problems, both by addressing the scale of the data algorithmically and through developing well tested and usable implementations.
Graduate Q&A: Sharbani Pandit
Sharbani Pandit graduated with a Ph.D. from the School of Computer Science, where she was advised by Professor Mustaque Ahamad. She works as an applied scientist at Amazon.
Why did you initially choose GT?
After completing my bachelor's from Bangladesh, I was applying to schools in U.S. and my major drive was to find a school where exciting research was being done. GT was at the top of my list because there were so many faculties doing cutting-edge, new, and exciting research. Once I got in, I was over the moon.
What’s your favorite memory from GT?
My favorite memory would have to be the time I won third prize at the Cyber Security Summit. I had applied in a rush and was not expecting to win at all. In fact, I wanted to leave early because I was missing a class. So it was a complete surprise when my name was announced.
What advice do you have for people embarking on a C.S. Ph.D.?
The most important thing you learn during your Ph.D. is not the specific skill set. Instead, it is the mindset of keep pushing forward when faced with challenges, persevering through numerous obstacles and failures, and being able to adapt to changing circumstances is the lifelong lesson here.
What are you doing next, and how did GT help you there?
I started working as an applied scientist at Amazon last month. My fraud detection expertise acquired from GT immensely helped in being in one of Amazon's most crucial teams.
Graduate Q&A: Srinivas Eswar
Though Georgia Tech doesn’t host commencement ceremonies in summer, many students complete their degrees and officially graduate. These unique graduates have the option between fall and spring commencement ceremonies to walk across the stage to be celebrated for earning their degrees. Until then, one graduate reflected upon memories during his time at Tech.
Srinivas Eswar graduated with a Ph.D. from the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) where he was advised by Regents’ Professor and Chair Haesun Park and Professor Rich Vuduc. Eswar described his fondest memories from Georgia Tech here in a Q&A.
What were your research interests and notable projects while at Georgia Tech?
I work on constrained low-rank approximation algorithms. In this field, we try to approximate data as highly structured matrices with constraints, like all entries must be nonnegative, columns sum to one, among many others. Specifically, my work has been developing parallel versions of these algorithms.
What is your favorite memory from Georgia Tech?
There are too many to choose from, ranging from lab dinners, College of Computing soccer matches, and attending various conferences. Picking one at random, during one of the few times it snowed in Atlanta (in Dec. 2017), a few lab mates and I built an enormous snowman outside Klaus. It was lots of fun, especially for a person who really doesn't like the cold.
What advice would you give to other students who are just getting started on their Ph.D. here?
Atlanta is one of the better-rounded cities with access to rivers, hills, parks, public tennis courts, and the usual city attractions. Since you're here for the long run, it makes sense to explore them. It helps to have a car.
What is next in your career? How did Georgia Tech help you get there?
I'll be starting at Argonne National Laboratory as a J.H. Wilkinson Fellow. I couldn't have gotten the position without the help of my advisors, Rich Vuduc and Haesun Park, and the various collaborators at Georgia Tech.

Graduating CS Major Flourishes After 'Casting a Wide Net'
People get into the field of computing for good to help others. But, as Jillian LaTour found out, the field can also be transformative for those who work in it.
LaTour is graduating from Georgia Tech with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree and a Minor in French on Dec. 18. But she wasn’t always sure she would make it this far.
During a tough first year when she struggled with homesickness and imposter syndrome, LaTour was ready to give up the Gold and White to move home and switch her major.
At the time, many of the people around her seemed to be achieving better results with the same amount of studying that she was doing. Adding to her frustration, it seemed as if some students were only interested their GPA.
[RELATED: Familiar Faces Among 2021 Fall Commencement Speakers]
With support from her family and friends, however, LaTour rallied to overcome these challenges. “I worked so hard to come to Georgia Tech and I didn’t come here to just drop out. So I stayed, and the rest is history,” said LaTour.
With the decision made to stick it out at Georgia Tech, LaTour, who graduated in 2018 from Cuthbertson High School in suburban Charlotte, N.C., began to “cast a wider net.”
As part of this, she started as a student worker for the College’s Office of Outreach, Enrollment, and Community (OEC). It was around this time, early in her second year, that she discovered Bits of Good at Georgia Tech, which connects students with local nonprofits to find computing-based solutions to real-world challenges.
Here, LaTour met people focused on different aspects of CS. “I was so excited. This was much more about, ‘let’s learn something, apply our skills, and help the community,'” she said.
Along with finding a new community through Bits of Good, LaTour learned about product management and the importance of client communications. She also learned a valuable lesson about herself.
“Some of the smartest people I’ve ever met are in this organization and they didn’t always have the greatest GPA. We’re always told this as students, but I guess I didn’t really believe it, but this is when I truly realized that my GPA does not define who I am,” LaTour said.
Since then, LaTour has flourished at Georgia Tech. She's been active in her sorority, spent a study-abroad semester in Paris, interned with IBM and Microsoft, and she still works with OEC coordinating events to support student organizations. She volunteered with HexLabs, tried-out for the crew team, and trained for a half marathon during the pandemic.
LaTour also continued working with Bits of Good and became a senior product manager this year.
“My advice is to cast a wide net and figure out what you want to do. As soon as you find your community you really thrive here, but you must put yourself out there to do that,” LaTour said.
With her degree in hand, LaTour is heading to Redmond, Washington in the spring to work as a software engineer with Microsoft.
Group Brings Seismic Imaging to Climate-Change Conversations and Beyond
A summer dominated by high gas prices and record-setting temperatures around the globe has intensified discussions on climate change. At the same time, a Georgia Tech research group has spent this summer preparing studies that could help reduce greenhouse gas levels through machine learning and high-performance computing methods.
The School of Computational Science and Engineering’s (CSE) Seismic Laboratory for Imaging and Modeling (SLIM) is a research group that specializes in providing industry partners with computational models that advance seismic imaging. Led by Professor Felix J. Herrmann, one area SLIM devotes their imaging research toward is Geological Carbon Storage (GCS), an emerging solution to help combat climate change.
“SLIM has been widely recognized as a world leader in the next generation of seismic acquisition, data processing, imaging, and monitoring for the oil and gas industry,” said Herrmann, who is based in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and holds a joint appointment with the School of CSE. “SLIM has recently made developments in the fields of compressive sensing and machine learning to drive innovations in wave-based inversion with applications in seismic monitoring.”
GCS is a process of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in deep, underground reservoirs. SLIM’s research in seismic imaging assists engineers to monitor carbon dioxide dynamics stored in the Earth’s subsurface. This includes detecting potential leaks in underground reservoirs, which minimizes risks in GCS projects.
While GCS is one of the few truly scalable solutions to help combat climate change, challenges remain to increase the number of injections sites while reducing risks and cost. These challenges make SLIM’s studies even more important for areas that stand to benefit from time-lapse seismic imaging, like GCS.
One obstacle inhibiting GCS is difficulty in conducting large-scale seismic imaging that is accurate, timely, and cost-effective. SLIM provides a novel approach that maps seismic images associated with one background model to another through velocity continuation. SLIM’s velocity continuation method is cheaper and faster than existing algorithms because it avoids creating new images from scratch. This potentially opens the way for large-scale, uncertainty-aware monitoring.
Another challenge in monitoring GCS is predicting how stored carbon dioxide will behave underground due to reservoir fluid properties like temperature and pressure. To address this problem, SLIM developed a model that uses a neural operator in place of a fluid-flow simulator. According to this study, the neural operator can forecast behavior of stored carbon dioxide at a fraction of computational cost of conventional numerical simulations.
A similarity between these studies are their use of Fourier neural operators. A neural operator is a deep learning method that solves partial differential equations, the essential mathematical formulations in understanding engineering phenomena. Fourier neural operators are a class of neural operator that once trained, can produce nearly identical results at several orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional numerical solvers.
“By gradually shifting gear to carbon storage monitoring with seismic techniques, SLIM aims to be part of the solution to climate change,” said CSE Ph.D. student Ziyi (Francis) Yin. “With the recent innovations in the group, we want to lower risk of carbon storage projects.”
Studying geophysical phenomenon without simulations is a SLIM specialty. Another SLIM paper introduces a simulation-free seismic survey design. SLIM’s method uses an annealing algorithm that provides accurate wavefield reconstruction with minimal seismic survey data. This design improves seismic data reconstruction without expensive and time-consuming wavefield simulations.
SLIM tested their research at small scale using synthetic case studies. The studies introduce solutions to seismic imaging and carbon sequestration that can be replicated at large scale and are available for industry use due to their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Even more, their methods have other potential applications such as further seismic exploration, medical imaging, and high-performance computing.
SLIM will present these studies Aug. 28 – Sept. 1 at the upcoming International Meeting for Applied Geoscience and Energy in Houston. IMAGE’22 provides a venue for geoscientists, industry professionals, and thought leaders to share best practices and develop strategies for the future, to include carbon sequestration.
“We have several presentations scheduled covering topics such as graph-theory-based seismic survey design to deep-learning-based methods for seismic imaging and uncertainty quantification,” said CSE alumnus Ali Siahkoohi. Siahkoohi completed his Ph.D. this summer and is now a postdoctoral scholar at Rice University.
Much of SLIM’s research funding comes from the Center for Machine Learning for Seismic Industry Partners Program (ML4SEISMIC). ML4SEISMIC is an initiative co-led by SLIM and Georgia Tech’s Center for Energy and Geo Processing that fosters research partnerships with innovators in the energy sector.
“SLIM has been involved with Society of Exploration Geophysics conferences for many years. Every year, we bring our latest developments to the IMAGE conference,” Yin said. “With the talent in our group, we can tackle large-scale geophysical problems with our cutting-edge computational methods.”
Groups Creating Opportunities for Underrepresented Students
Making connections is a big part of the Georgia Tech experience. For Black students and others from underrepresented communities, however, connecting with students with similar backgrounds isn’t always easy.
Taking on the challenges presented by a lack of representation, College of Computing students have established organizations dedicated to serving these communities within the college.
These student organizations, according to College of Computing Director of the Office of Community and Student Enrichment Troy Peace, create pathways for underrepresented students “that promote culture, creating community and develop career opportunities. Additionally, they assist in creating personal and professional bonds that will last a lifetime.”
The first such group, Minorities at the College of Computing (M@CC), was established in 2004. Since it began, this student-led organization has grown from a handful of members to now providing programming and services for hundreds of students from across campus.
M@CC provides a supportive space for students to question, discuss, and share their experiences and opinions about the tech field. Beyond this, second-year computer science (CS) major and M@CC Co-president Assata Quinichett says the primary goal of M@CC is to connect students with prestigious companies and organizations that are looking to hire minority students.
“We maintain relationships with corporate partnerships, create career and academic development programming, and maintain student resources for career development,” said Quinichett.
Along with facilitating club meetings and managing its website and social media, Quinichett and her M@CC co-president, third-year CS major Lawrence Williams, organize resume workshops, interview prep sessions, and engineering panels for students.
M@CC meets Wednesdays in the College of Computing Building, room 017. The group welcomes all Georgia Tech students. “It’s a great place to meet other students, find mentors, and network. Anyone can support by attending and we are open to collaborating with other organizations,” said Quinichett.
The college is also home to two student-led groups for women. Graduate Women at the College of Computing was founded in 2012, while Women at the College of Computing (W@CC) was founded in 2015.
Like M@CC, these groups are about creating a supportive space for their membership. “I'd say our mission is to help provide a space for women in computer science to form connections with their peers while networking with companies and developing professional skills,” said second-year CS major and W@CC co-president Priya Rajeev.
She adds that anyone looking for a place to meet other women in CS is invited to attend the organization’s weekly meetings. These are led by Rajeev and her co-president, third-year CS major Angela Young, and held Thursdays at 6:30 p.m. via the group’s Slack channel.
W@CC is a transgender-affirming group and welcomes people of all identities. “We'd love to see support, not necessarily directly for our club, but rather in promoting our mission. For those who see themselves traditionally represented in classrooms, find ways to uplift marginalized voices and make sure that they are heard,” said Rajeev.
The Grad W@CC group meets monthly and organizes workshops throughout the year.
“I'm excited to see the progression of these student organizations moving forward. The leaders of these organizations are doing a great job of connecting with students and promoting membership, upcoming programs, events, and opportunities,” said Peace.
GTGraffiti: The Robot That Paints Like a Human
Robotics students from Georgia Tech have built a first-of-its-kind graffiti-painting robot. And yes, it's as cool as it sounds!
Detailed in a paper by the students at the 2022 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation last month, GTGraffiti uses motion capture technology to record human painting motions and then composes and processes the gestures to program a cable-driven robot that spray paints graffiti artwork.
Check out the video produced by the College of Computing and the full story to find out how it works, and what's next for this innovative robotic system.

Hispanic Heritage Month: Adriana Alvarado Uses Technology To Support Human Rights
When Adriana Alvarado moved to Barcelona, Spain, to pursue a master’s degree in cognitive science and interactive systems, she saw her home country, Mexico, from an outside perspective for the first time.
In September of 2014, Alvarado’s perspective was dramatically impacted. She was in Barcelona when the overnight disappearance of 43 students near the Mexican Pacific coast sent shockwaves throughout Mexico. That event has left family members seeking answers to this day. But since that moment, Alvarado has been interested in understanding what role technology could play to support victims of human rights violations.
More than 100,000 people have gone missing in Mexico since 1964, when a government agency began keeping statistics. However, most of these people were only registered as missing when former president Felipe Calderón started the war on drugs in 2006.
In response to the crisis, people established grassroots and nonprofit organizations for the sole purpose of searching for these missing people and providing more accurate information about just how many had disappeared. While the exact number of missing people remains unknown, these organizations have shown the inconsistency between the data they’ve collected and the figures provided by government reports.
Alvarado, who completed her Ph.D. in human-centered computing from Georgia Tech in May and will attend her graduation ceremony in December, played a role in helping those organizations obtain more accurate data. She realized how much potential social media could have in addressing the problem.
“By the time I started my Ph.D., I was already very familiar with several Facebook groups, all within Mexico, and what is interesting about these Facebook groups is that people will share data and their experiences with violence in their communities. I thought there was a lot of value in that data,” Alvarado said.

The challenge was figuring out how to help the nonprofits she worked with act on that data. In a research article Alvarado authored in 2020, she explored the potential of using data from Facebook as evidence for human rights advocacy. She and her collaborators collected and analyzed more than 13,000 posts and 2,000 associated comments from 45 Facebook groups targeting the four municipalities within Mexico with the highest rates of reported abductions during 2017.
“We found on Facebook roughly 300 official cases of (missing people), and on the official statistics, there were maybe 20,” Alvarado said.
While it was impossible to provide the exact number of missing persons, Alvarado’s work helped bring awareness that government agencies had been understating the issue.
Alvarado said she chose the human-computer interaction track because she wanted to use computer science to spur social change and design structures that societies need to function.
“I’ve always been interested in how people do things differently in different places,” she said. “In Mexico, I think in terms of culture, something that we have a lot of in Latin America is that we always find a way to do things. Regardless of the situation. I wanted to pursue something more situated when designing systems, figuring out what we need to know about people, about society, to design more appropriate technology. Human-computer interaction is exactly that.”
Alvarado was advised at Georgia Tech by Christopher Le Dantec, an associate professor with appointments in the School of Interactive Computing and the School of Literature, Media, and Communication. Le Dantec said he often looks to work with students from underrepresented communities, and Alvarado’s research appeared to be in a natural alignment with his own.
“When she first came here, she was laser-focused,” Le Dantec said. “She was building her confidence that she could go and make a difference.
“It’s less common that students come in with a clear research agenda. When she came in, she knew exactly what she wanted to do. She knew the exact research questions she wanted to pursue. She was willing to jump in, no hesitation on doing the hard work.”
In 2019, Alvarado was named part of the first data fellow cohort of the United Nations Global Pulse, a fellowship that led her to work with the UN’s Accelerator Lab in Mexico from 2020 to this spring.
“Working with the Accelerator Lab profoundly transformed the course of my research,” Alvarado said. “The long-term partnership helped me to recognize the role of data and organizational practices and integrating social media content into their work.”
Through that experience, Alvarado constructed a toolkit that supports nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations by comprising a set of guidelines and recommendations to help them determine whether social media data is appropriate for them to use and analyze.
Alvarado knows it’s likely she wouldn’t have pursued her research if she hadn’t decided to leave home. As an immigrant and the first member of her family to attend high school and college, living outside of Mexico has broadened her perspective on the world and different cultures.
She doesn’t plan on going back to Mexico. Instead, she’ll continue to explore new ways of helping nonprofits and non-government organizations collect and use data for social change. There’s more work to be done, she said, and she believes technology within the field of human-computer interaction always needs refining.
“In those four years of fieldwork, I began to understand that we need to be very, very critical of technology that we develop,” she said. “Be very critical about the limitations and capabilities. What I was trying to do with the toolkit was to help people in nonprofits to understand that yes, there’s value in the data from social media platforms, but there are also many constraints. If we are going to use this type of data, we need to be very conscious and aware of those limitations and what we can we do to address them.”
Hispanic Heritage: Q&A with CS Major Ruben Rivadeneira
Ruben Rivadeneira is studying human-computer interaction and pursuing a master's degree through the College's B.S./M.S. program in Computer Science. Prior to completing his undergraduate work last year, Rivadeneira shared some of his thoughts about the importance of Hispanic Heritage Month and how he defines success.
Where is your family from originally?
My family is originally from Ecuador, but we moved to the United States when I was five and have lived here ever since.
Why is it important to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month?
Our country is built off the hard work and sacrifice of many different groups of people that have contributed to making the United States what it is today. Despite the fact there is still much work to be done, I see Hispanic Heritage Month as a way to honor this hard work and sacrifice of the Latin American community throughout the years by celebrating our cultures and diversity. Even among our community, we have a level of diversity and vast, rich cultures that I would love to expose others to. The celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month is the perfect opportunity to do just that!
What advice do you have for high school students considering CS?
It would definitely be to ask for help when you need it because you don’t have to struggle alone. Here at Georgia Tech, I’ve been pushed to my limits and I was really bad at asking for help when I needed it. I realized this mentality of “I can do it alone; I don’t want to bother others with my problems” was not sustainable and I slowly started going to the TA help desks and studying with classmates. I ended up meeting some of my best friends as a result and realized that we’re all struggling, but at the end of the day, we’re struggling together and pulling through.
Beyond money, awards, and job titles, what’s the biggest measure of success?
I think having a strong network is just as valuable, if not more valuable than money, awards, and job titles, because I’ve come to realize that who you know is priceless. Simply building rapport with the people you meet has allowed me to grow on a personal and professional level while opening up new opportunities that I would have otherwise dreamed of having. In times of need, my network has helped me get back on track to becoming the person I dream of being, not the person that I had settled for becoming during the pandemic, and I am forever grateful to them for that.
What’s the next big thing you’d like to accomplish?
I haven’t thought too far out into the future, but I know the next big accomplishment I want to achieve is going to be graduating with my master’s degree from Georgia Tech and going into industry, at least for a couple of years. Along the way, things could change and other opportunities might appear, but I’m just excited to see where life takes me after graduation.

ICLR 2023: Like Humans and Animals, AI Agents Find Their Way Through Memory
Memory may be just as important to artificial intelligence (AI) agents in creating ‘mental maps’ as it is to humans and animals.
A recent paper authored by Georgia Tech researchers makes a surprising discovery — blind AI agents use memory to create maps and navigate through their surrounding environment.
Erik Wijmans, the lead author of the paper, said the idea for his research began by asking if AI agents might mimic human and animal behavior in how they navigate and adjust to their environments.
“Humans and animals navigate with some type of spatial representation — what is commonly referred to as a cognitive map,” Wijmans said. “So, we were wondering how AI agents navigate and if it’s similar to that.
“The first question we asked was, ‘Is memory important to these agents?' It is. They tend to remember at least the past thousand interactions with their environment.”
Wijmans completed his Ph.D. in computer science in 2022 and is currently a research scientist at Apple.
Wijmans created blind AI agents and trained them by dropping them into the floorplans of more than 500 houses with the goal of navigating from one area of the house to another area. The only sense it had to work with was egomotion — the ability to know how far it has moved.
The agent bumped its way around from room to room, backtracking as needed, before finding its destination. Wijmans then created a second probe agent that was injected with the memories of the first agent. The probe agent used the memory of the original agent to take shortcuts to quickly reach its objective.
“It’s surprising that they can do this without vision because they’re in an unknown environment that they’ve never seen before, so they have to figure out how to navigate in that environment and also figure out the structure of it,” Wijmans said.
“This is a result that shows that our hypothesis is true, or at the very least along the right direction. We took an agent and put it in a complex environment and trained it for a task that requires it to interact with that environment, and the result was mapping.”
Wijman’s paper, Emergence of Maps in the Memories of Blind Navigation Agents, is one of four outstanding paper award winners for the 2023 International Conference on Learning Representations, which is being held May 1-5 in Kigali, Rwanda. His research was also recognized by the Georgia Tech chapter of Sigma Xi (The Scientific Research Society) and received a 2023 GT Sigma XI Best Ph.D. Thesis Award.
Wijmans is advised by School of Interactive Computing Distinguished Professor Irfan Essa and Associate Professor Dhruv Batra.
“Erik makes fundamental contributions to multiple sub-areas of AI, including reinforcement learning, robotics, and embodied perception,” Batra said. “His hypothesis is a bold one — that intelligence emerges via large-scale learning by an embodied agent accomplishing goals in a rich 3D environment.”
In his paper, Wijmans describes mapping as an emerging phenomenon. Neural network models for navigation have performed well despite not containing any explicit mapping modules.
Wijman’s AI agents showed a 95% success rate when they used memory to navigate, whereas memoryless agents failed entirely. This seems to suggest that agents create mental maps as a natural part of learning to navigate.
“The results were so initially surprising, that my first gut instinct was that we had done something wrong in our experimental design,” he said.
“This is a work with a very complex body of experiments that tie together a single narrative,” he said. “This is a challenging thing to do. When you’re trying to test whether something involves memory, you must come up with ideas of what to test for and how to test for that. You must make each experiment as precise as possible to not get false positives, and that involves considerable experimental design and effort.”
Wijmans said he made it as difficult as possible for the agent to reach its goal, removing vision, audio, olfactory, haptic, and magnetic sensing and gave it no bias toward mapping. It had no supervision or any kind of outside help.
“Surprisingly, even under these deliberately harsh conditions, we find the emergence of map-like spatial representations in the agent’s non-spatial unstructured memory. It not only successfully navigates to the goal but also exhibits intelligent behavior like taking shortcuts, following walls, and detecting collisions.”
The discovery also suggests that AI, humans, and animals all share a natural characteristic of problem solving and navigation.
“The one link that we can make is the idea of convergent evolution, which is where you see the same mechanism evolve multiple times in species that have no common ancestor that shares that mechanism,” Wijmans said. “Mammals build maps, insects build maps, and now AI agents build maps. So perhaps mapping is the natural solution to navigation.”
Iditarod Sled Dogs Test New Device That Could Reduce Injuries for Canine Athletes
Whether pulling a sled across the frozen tundra for hundreds of miles or guiding a visually impaired runner on a cross-country marathon, canine athletes are as prone to injury as their human counterparts.
To help reduce injuries and improve performance for canine athletes, student researchers at Georgia Tech have developed a wearable activity and gait detection device – known as WAG'd – as part of an animal-centered computing course led by College of Computing Associate Professor Melody Jackson.
With support from the GVU Center's Prototyping Lab, development on the device continued following the course last fall. Prototype in hand, the interdisciplinary team then went to Alaska in March to connect with an Iditarod musher and his sled dogs to conduct field research.
Learn more about the students behind this innovative project, which was reviewed and approved by Georgia Tech's Institutional Review Board (IRB), and how it came together in this fast-paced video profile created by GT Computing videographer Kevin Beasley.
Inaugural Award Recognizes Paper’s Lasting Impact on Mental Health Research
As social media research continues to advance at a breakneck pace, staying relevant is no easy feat.
Work from Georgia Tech’s Munmun De Choudhury done nearly a decade ago, however, is holding up. In fact, she and her co-authors from Microsoft Research were just awarded the inaugural Web Science Trust Test of Time Award.
Presented at the 14th Annual ACM Web Science Conference, being held this week in Barcelona, Spain, the award recognizes the lasting impact of the team’s 2013 paper Social Media as a Measurement Tool of Depression in Populations.
“When we wrote this paper, little did we know what it meant for times to come. We are energized more than ever before to see how this work can push the boundaries of population mental health,” De Choudhury, an associate professor in the School of Interactive Computing, said in a tweet on June 26.
The award was announced during the conference’s opening session. Dame Wendy Hall, Web Science Trust executive director, made the announcement saying that it was difficult at first to choose from among all the groundbreaking papers presented over the last decade at the Web Science Conference.
“But the trustees felt that this paper captured an important analysis of nearly 70,000 user posts to develop a novel social media depression index—helping us to understand more about the society that we shape (and that shapes us) through the Web.
“The paper has been well-cited, and the issue of mental health certainly retains much relevance today,” said Hall.
The paper, written by De Choudhury, Scott Counts, and Eric Horvitz, was first presented at the 2013 ACM Web Science Conference in Paris, France. As part of the recognition of the work’s impact, De Choudhury is re-presenting the award-winning paper, and discussing its impact, during an online keynote presentation, June 29, at 9:45 a.m. EDT (3:45 p.m. CEST).
The Web Science Trust is a UK charity promoting the understanding of the web, through education and research in the discipline of web science.
Inaugural Conference to Bring Added Value to OMSCS Experience, Network
With more than 8,600 alumni and nearly 11,500 current students spread across the planet, creating a real sense of community is a tough ask for administrators of Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program.
Taking this challenge for action, the groundbreaking program is hosting its inaugural OMSCS Conference on May 3-4, as part of its ongoing community-building initiatives for students and alumni.
“It’s not just an academic or professional experience,” said Ana Rusch, OMSCS associate director for diversity, equity, inclusion, and student life in the College of Computing. “It’s community-building. And it showcases the impact our program has had on our students.”
In-person registration is closed, but OMSCS students and alumni wishing to participate can still register to attend the conference virtually.
The OMSCS Conference kicks off with a welcome speech by Rusch and Alex Duncan, OMSCS associate director of student experience, who are the conference’s co-chairs. Zvi Galil, former College of Computing dean – and a driving force behind the establishment of the OMSCS program – is scheduled to deliver the keynote address.
[RELATED: Surveyed Alumni Nearly Unanimous in Saying OMSCS Program Worth the Investment]
The conference schedule includes a variety of presentations, technical talks, demos, and workshops. Among the many networking opportunities, the conference includes a career fair featuring a small, select group of companies.
“The conference is part of a broader range of initiatives directed at community-building,” said Duncan. “We think it’s going to be a meaningful in-person annual experience for students and alumni that adds real value to their OMSCS experience, as well as to their OMSCS network.”
The conference is taking place in the Marcus Nanotechnology Building at Georgia Tech. Conference organizers are currently seeking volunteers, who would get access to both days of the conference. Volunteers can sign-up using this form.
The inaugural OMSCS Conference is largely funded by a $20,000 Provost’s Fund for Excellence in Graduate Studies grant. If you have any questions about the conference, please e-mail the conference organizers at omscs-conf@groups.gatech.edu.
Inaugural Dean for Inclusive Excellence Has 'Expansive Vision of What Inclusivity, Equity Can Mean'
The College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology has chosen Cedric Stallworth as its inaugural Associate Dean for Inclusive Excellence.
Stallworth has administered educational programs at Georgia Tech for more than two decades, most recently as the Assistant Dean for Outreach, Enrollment and Community. In his new role, Stallworth will have overall responsibility for developing and advancing diversity and equity initiatives within the College.
“I view my new position as an opportunity to contribute to the legacy and culture of innovation that has become synonymous with the College of Computing,” said Stallworth, a double Georgia Tech alumnus (EE 90, MS CS 99) and former Georgia Tech football player.
“I want to create cultural momentum in the diversity-inclusion-equity- and belonging space. I want to facilitate conversations that will define our goals, plan our path, measure our progress, and then share our journey with the world.”
The College already has multiple programs designed to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups participating in computing. These initiatives include:
- The Computing Equity Project teaches AP computer science in the Atlanta Public Schools
- DataWorks employs and trains adults from underrepresented groups as data wranglers
- Summer camps that now stretch from Atlanta to locations across the state, and even to the Virgin Islands
As part of his new responsibilities, Stallworth will lead Georgia Tech's Constellations Center of Equity in Computing, which is housed in the College of Computing.
“Cedric has decades of experience, and an expansive vision of what inclusivity and equity can mean for the College,” said Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay chair of the College of Computing. “I expect him to make a difference, and I look forward to seeing it happen."
Inclusion and Community Top Priorities for OMSCS Women in Tech Seminar
When Georgia Tech launched its Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program nearly a decade ago, less than 11% of students enrolled were women.
Female representation in the groundbreaking program has grown since the Fall 2014 semester. In fact, it’s doubled. Of the 11,487 OMSCS students enrolled in Fall 2022, 22% were women.
To help ensure these women succeed, and to ensure the percentage of women enrolled in the program continues to grow, administrators established the OMSCS Women in Tech seminar.
Co-founders Ana Rusch and David Joyner, executive director of Online Education & OMSCS, created the OMSCS Women in Tech seminar to explore the contributions of women and non-binary technologists in CS and information technology, promote academic growth, and facilitate community.
Perhaps most importantly, they created the seminar to help instill a sense of belonging and inclusion for these students.
“You study the stats on women in computer science (CS), but it really comes to life every semester when we introduce ourselves in the seminar. The words, ‘I have never seen so many women in the same screen/space before’ or, ‘I am the only woman in my team/department/job’, are stated repeatedly,” said Rusch, OMSCS associate director of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Student Life.
The weekly virtual seminar is an opportunity for students to network with peers and other tech professionals. Guest speakers, often Georgia Tech alumni such as Nova Ahmed (CS Ph.D. 10), participate each semester. They cover topics relating to the barriers and challenges confronting women and non-binary people working and studying in tech fields. Conversations generated from the weekly seminar are kept going through online thread discussion platforms like Slack and Ed Discussion.
Although the focus is on women and non-binary students, the OMSCS Women in Tech seminar is open to all students, regardless of gender.
“Georgia Tech, the College of Computing, and OMSCS are dedicated to diversity and inclusion. It is a privilege to be part of an organization where something like the OMSCS Women in Tech seminar is incredibly supported, celebrated, and valued,” said Rusch, who is a first-generation Cuban immigrant and a first-generation college graduate.
Incoming Chair Will Bring 'Interdisciplinary Thinking' to School of Interactive Computing
Shaowen Bardzell has been named the next chair of the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech.
The school announced today that Bardzell will replace Ayanna Howard, who left to become the Dean of the College of Engineering at The Ohio State University in 2021.
Bardzell officially begins her new role on July 1.
“Shaowen Bardzell has infused her computing research with ideas from design, social science, and ethics,” said Georgia Tech’s Dean of Computing Charles Isbell. “The breadth of her research and her interdisciplinary thinking make her a perfect fit for a school that focuses on technology and the human experience.”
Bardzell comes to Georgia Tech from the Penn State University’s College of Information Sciences and Technology, where she has been serving as Professor-in-Charge of Human Computer Interaction since 2020. Before starting her role at Penn State, she was a professor at the Indiana University-Bloomington School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering from 2008 to 2020. She obtained her doctorate in comparative literature with minors in medieval studies and English literature from Indiana University-Bloomington.
“The School of Interactive Computing has always been known for our efforts to improve the human condition,” said School of Interactive Computing Interim Chair Betsy DiSalvo. “Shaowen Bardzell’s position as our new chair reflects our ongoing commitment to research and development of responsible computing.
“Shaowen has a history of brining a critical lens to computing. As the chair of IC, she will have a platform to share that critical lens and lead us in novel directions for computing research.”
Bardzell has published more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific papers and is the co-author of Humanistic HCI (Morgan & Claypool, 2015) and co-editor of Critical Theory and Interaction Design (MIT Press, 2018). She has been awarded more than $13 million in external grants and has won more than a dozen best paper and honorable mention awards for her research.
Bardzell is the director of the Cultural Research in Technology (CRIT) Lab at Penn State, which brings a humanistic perspective to the design of interactive technologies, critiques interactive technologies regarding their sociocultural impacts, and investigates users, use-situations, and technologies where culture is strongly implicated in the success of the technology.
“I am attracted to the School of IC chair opportunity in part because, rather than distracting from my research, it gives me an opportunity to link my research to service, both in ideas and impact,” Bardzell said. “I hope to support the intellectual and professional growth of the community, and in this position, I see an opportunity to do so, connected to what I’m good at and care most about.”
Bardzell said she is looking forward to working with her new colleagues at the School of Interactive Computing to create a collaborative effort to impact society with technology. Diversity and interdisciplinary research are two of the main reasons she was attracted to the School.
The School of Interactive Computing has a diverse base of more than 50 faculty members who teach and study within a broad range of interdisciplinary research fields. Those fields include human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, data visualization and graphics, computer vision, ubiquitous and wearable computing, natural language processing, social computing, and cognitive science.
“My goal is to identify concrete ways to amplify the work of my colleagues and thinking critically, and in a mentoring way, about what we can do for our junior colleagues and students, both locally and beyond,” Bardzell said.
“If we want to solve society’s most difficult problems, one discipline will not have all the answers. Solving these problems requires interdisciplinary collaboration where we get to do what we are strong at while being respectful of each other’s disciplinary outlooks and epistemological commitments.”
Along with being named as the School of Interactive Computing chair, it was announced today that Bardzell is a recipient of the 2023 Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) Societal Impact Award. The award is given to senior and mid-career human-computer interaction researchers whose research positively affects real-world issues.
Bardzell’s service record to SIGCHI is also extensive. While serving as the Vice-President at Large of SIGCHI from 2019 to 2021, she co-founded SIGCHI CARES, a committee of the SIGCHI Executive Committee that serves as a "resource for those who experience discrimination or harassment in violation of ACM's policies governing SIG activities." In 2021-2022, she also served as the elected SIGCHI Executive Vice-President, working alongside SIGCHI president and Interactive Computing Associate Professor Neha Kumar.
SIGCHI announced today that Interactive Computing Associate Professor Munmun De Choudhury has also received the 2023 Societal Impact Award, sharing the honor with Bardzell.

It was all good stuff, and it sounded like everybody was on the same page. And then the aura of polite togetherness was punctured when Kamau Bobb, who works on diversity strategy for Google and is the founder of the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech, delivered a smoldering keynote address that focused not so much on feel-good tech outreach programs but on the state of black folks in Atlanta, a majority-black city where black people are assumed to be thriving.
Interactive Computing Associate Professor, Incoming Chair Earn SIGCHI Awards
School of Interactive Computing Associate Professor Munmun De Choudhury has spent more than a decade studying social media and online forums with the goal of making the internet a better place.
For her career efforts, De Choudhury is the co-recipient of the 2023 Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) Societal Impact Award.
SIGCHI, which is supported by the Association for Computing Machinery, announced the winners of its annual awards on Tuesday. Each year, SIGCHI recognizes individuals with its Lifetime Research Award, Lifetime Practice Award, Lifetime Service Award, Societal Impact Award, and Outstanding Dissertation Award.
The Societal Impact Award is given to mid-career or senior individuals who work to address social issues through human-computer interaction.
“I’m incredibly honored and grateful,” De Choudhury said. “It’s a recognition of some of the work we have been doing to understand and improve mental health outcomes in individuals, communities, and larger populations and societies through ethical analyses of people’s activities and social connections online. The award is as much of a recognition of the work and achievements of my students and collaborators as it is for me.”
For more than 10 years, De Choudhury has researched what she calls the “double-edged sword” of social media. Social media platforms can serve as an outlet or a safe space for people to gain support for their mental health, but they can just as easily serve as a detriment.
“These platforms influence how we conceptualize, seek help, or provide support around mental health," she said. "Sometimes these influences are positive. But other times, these platforms expose people to information that could be harmful. The work we’ve published at SIGCHI-affiliated conferences over the years has looked at both of those dimensions.”
De Choudhury has pioneered research in this area through an interdisciplinary approach that is essential for real-world translation and societal impact. She has combined social computing, machine learning, and natural language processing with concepts and theories from social, behavioral, and health sciences. Along the way, she has partnered with medical institutions, mental health advocacy organizations, and public health organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
De Choudhury has served on the scientific advisory boards for Open Up, an online peer support technology, and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. She serves on a committee supported by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that examines current research on social media and young people.
De Choudhury is no stranger to the SIGCHI community. She has won more than a dozen best paper and honorable mention awards at the Computer-Human Interaction (CHI) Conference, which is the annual flagship conference hosted internationally by SIGCHI. She has also won best paper at the Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW), another SIGCHI event.
The SIGCHI Societal Impact Award adds to the numerous other recognitions De Choudhury has received in her career. These include:
- The Web Science Trust Test-of-Time Award in 2022
- The ACM-W Rising Star Award in 2021
- The Complex Systems Society Junior Scientific Award in 2019
The Societal Impact Award comes with a $5,000 gift and the opportunity to speak at the 2023 CHI conference April 23-28 in Hamburg, Germany. The award is generally given to two to three people each year.
Other recipients this year include Shaowen Bardzell, who was announced as the new chair of the School of Interactive Computing on Tuesday. Gregory Abowd, a former Regents’ professor at the School of Interactive Computing who spent 26 years at Georgia Tech before becoming the Dean of the College of Engineering at Northeastern University, has been given the Lifetime Research Award.
Interim Chairs to Guide Schools During Search Process
The names of interim chairs were announced this weekend for two of the College of Computing’s three schools.
Srinivas Aluru is now interim chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE). Mostafa Ammar will take the helm of the School of Computer Science (SCS) as interim chair beginning August 16.
The announcement came Sunday in an email to faculty from Zvi Galil, the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing.
“We are fortunate to have experienced leaders to guide these schools for the near term. Srinivas and Mostafa are each well known to their respective faculty, staff, and students, and will continue pushing forward as each school searches for its new chair,” Galil said.
Aluru is a CSE professor who also serves as the co-director for the Institute for Data Engineering and Science. His research interests are high-performance computing, data science, bioinformatics, and systems biology. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers.
Ammar is a Regents’ Professor with SCS and served as the associate chair of the school from 2006 to 2012. His research interests are in network architectures, protocols, and services. He is a fellow of the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers and of the Association for Computing Machinery.
Isbell Begins Term as Dean of Computing
When Charles Isbell applied to college, he applied to only one: the Georgia Institute of Technology.
“I didn’t want to go anywhere else,” he said. He had grown up in Atlanta, graduating from Mays High School, and he loved the city. More than that, he already knew that he wanted to work with computers, and he knew Georgia Tech was one of the best places in the world to do so.
When he got to campus, he knew right away that he had made a good decision.
“I always felt I belonged at Georgia Tech,” Isbell said. “No, I didn’t join a frat, I wasn’t part of any of the big clubs,” he said. “Hey, I went to zero parties. Zero. But I did build friendships. I built connections.” He also, in a nice bit of symmetry, served as the undergraduate representative on the committee that hired Peter Freeman to be the first dean of the brand new College of Computing.
Today, Charles Isbell becomes the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing. He is the fourth person to hold this position. His philosophy as dean is built on the foundation he laid long ago as an undergraduate.
“To me, it’s all about community,” he said. “I want people to feel like they belong, and that the community reflects their experiences. I want people to feel that the things they’re learning apply to their worlds.”
Machines Bringing People Together
Isbell went to MIT after graduating from Georgia Tech, and after that spent four years working at AT&T Labs. During that time, he continued to pursue his interests in computing and human connection.
The first project that earned Isbell a “best paper” award was his work on Cobot, a software agent whose goal was to become a functioning member of an online social community called LambdaMOO.
“I’m interested in how humans express themselves in a way that computers can understand – from a technical, machine learning point of view, that is,” Isbell said.
He also found new ways to use technology to serve existing real-life communities. At MIT, he built what was most likely the first-ever online Black history database. He ran a website for hip-hop reviews.
To this day, he continues to mix his cultural experience and computing. All of his graduating students pose for photos dressed like members of the funk band Parliament in a silver top-hat, star-shaped sunglasses, and strings of Mardi Gras beads. The framed and funky photos line the walls of his office.
Isbell says that combining his passions keeps him engaged and that he likes to see others do the same.
“If you’re passionate, people pick up on that passion,” he said.
Giving Back
In 2002, Isbell was hired as a junior faculty member in the College of Computing and moved back to Atlanta.
“First thing that happened when I came back, my mother made me a bowl of cheese grits and bacon,” he said. “I knew I was back home.”
At the Institute, things were more complicated.
“It was so exciting to be back, but the place was completely different,” he said. It was bigger, a stronger program with a ballooning reputation. “Still, I always felt I could build something here.”
After earning tenure, Isbell dived into administrative work to do exactly that. He was one of the architects of the college’s award-winning Threads curriculum, and also of its groundbreaking Online Master’s of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program.
“I just kept volunteering,” he said. “Then one day I woke up as dean.”
Redefining the Field
He didn’t, of course. Wake up as dean, that is. Isbell won the job in a grueling nationwide search. He is the first internal candidate ever to be named as the dean of the College of Computing.
And as someone who has been in or around the college for decades, he has a unique view on its development. When Isbell arrived as an undergraduate, computing was still in its infancy at Georgia Tech — it wasn’t even a college yet.
Through his tenure on the faculty, he has seen the college grow and mature. Now, he says, the college is truly entering adulthood, a top-10 program with responsibilities not only to its faculty, staff, and students but also to the larger world.
“The technology we develop is transformative, and we have to reckon with that,” he said. “We have to accept our responsibility as leaders and our responsibility to bring other people along for this ride.”
As dean, he intends to build on the hard work of his predecessors in confronting the challenges of a field that is always changing and always short of labor. And as computing metastasizes into other fields – finance, health, media, politics, art — he sees social and ethical considerations becoming ever more important.
The good news is that the College of Computing is already addressing these problems, Isbell said. OMSCS has diversified and significantly increased the pipeline of trained talent to industry. Our Constellations Center for Equity in Computing is piloting a hybrid classroom-online model that holds the promise of making computer science education available to all children. The college has made ground-breaking commitments to not only teach ethics to the students, but to computing research that prioritizes transparency and the public good.
In other words, Isbell wants Georgia Tech to lead a re-thinking of the nature and importance of community in the field of computing.
“It seems increasingly clear that computer scientists need to think more clearly about the impact of their work on society as a whole,” Isbell said. “That’s going to require the involvement of everyone who is affected — which is to say, everyone.”
Isbell to Present Keynote at Premier Neural Processing Conference
With 28 papers to present, the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) is poised to make a big splash at the 2020 Neural Processing and Information Systems (NeurIPS) conference. Adding to the excitement is ML@GT faculty member and Dean of Georgia Tech’s College of Computing, Charles Isbell, will give an invited talk.
Isbell’s talk, You Can’t Escape Hyperparameters and Latent Variables: Machine Learning as a Software Engineering Enterprise, will take people through the ages of artificial intelligence. With the conference occurring in December, the presentation incorporates A Christmas Carol theme with Isbell acting as the “Ghosts of AI Past, Present, and Future.”

Lab Working to Improve Health and Wellness in Black Communities
Andrea Grimes Parker is on a mission. As a human-centered computing (HCC) associate professor at Georgia Tech, she’s dedicating her career to developing new ways to overcome long-standing barriers to health equity in Black communities and other underserved groups.
Parker is the founder and director of the Wellness Technology Lab (WT Lab) in the School of Interactive Computing. The lab’s mission is to explore how technology can be used to improve health outcomes and wellbeing in communities with less access to health and wellness resources.
“I take it as an ethical imperative to explore not only how I, as a human-centered computing researcher, can innovate in the digital health space, but also how my lab can harness the power of technology to reduce and ultimately help eliminate health disparities,” says Parker, who founded the lab in 2013 at Northeastern University and brought it to Georgia Tech in 2020.
Parker and her graduate and undergraduate student researchers focus much of their work on the health-related experiences of marginalized and underserved groups. They study how digital tools can be designed to help these groups take an active role in improving their wellbeing. Based on these studies, the researchers determine the effectiveness of the new tools and make recommendations for improvement.
To empower people to be able to take an active role in the own wellbeing, and move the needle in reducing health inequities, Parker recognized early on that her lab would need to be community centered.
Working from this premise, the WT Lab’s projects are made possible through key partnerships with youth empowerment groups, churches, and other grassroots organizations seeking to help the communities they serve. These partnerships, says Parker, are driven by the needs, perspectives, and values of individuals within the communities.
“Community-engaged work is essential for developing health technologies that are effective and engaging. It requires additional time and work to build and maintain community relationships, but it is absolutely necessary and ultimately incredibly rewarding,” says Parker, a Georgia Tech alumna (HCC Ph.D. 11).

Current WT Lab projects – many supported by awards from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Johnson & Johnson, Google, and Fitbit – are addressing individual, environmental, and societal factors negatively impacting health and wellness in Black communities.
In one set of projects, the lab is exploring how social computing tools can empower youth in low-socioeconomic-status communities to engage in civic action that tackles social issues within their communities. In another set of projects, the researchers are investigating how mobile health applications can improve postpartum wellbeing in rural Black women, who have much higher maternal mortality and morbidity rates than any other racial group in the United States.
Along with these efforts, the WT Lab also recently partnered with a group of historically Black churches in Boston to address Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy in Black communities.
For this initiative, Parker and the WT Lab are collaborating with Northeastern University, the Boston Medical Center, and the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston TenPoint to develop a virtual healthcare counselor that answers questions and addresses concerns specifically related to the Covid-19 vaccine. The project is funded by a $2.8 million NIH award.
One of the key researchers on the project is Darley Sackitey, a first-year human-centered computing Ph.D. student. She and her fellow researchers are examining how spirituality and community intersect with health, and how this intersection can be leveraged to foster positive health outcomes for people in historically marginalized populations.

“I had never done community-based work before, and this was a great opportunity to learn more, especially because as a researcher, I value centering the voices of the people we work with, especially when they have historically been erased,” says Sackitey, who is from Ghana.
“I also find the intersection of spirituality, tech, and health to be fascinating. Typically, these things are rather separate and at odds with each other in western cultures, but growing up in Ghana, they were often closely tied, and thinking about how technology could embody this relationship was exciting to me,” adds Sackitey.
Parker agrees and is equally excited about what’s possible when the power of digital technology is harnessed to break down longstanding barriers to health equity in Black and underserved communities.
“I work to make sure that in everything we do, we are keeping health equity at the center of our focus as we work to make sure that the technologies we develop help to improve the wellbeing of low-socio-economic communities and communities of color who disproportionately experience poor health,” says Parker.
Large, Interdisciplinary Class is ‘Ramblin On’ with Tech Degrees in Hand
Another semester is in the books for the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE). The term concluded on May 5 with Spring Commencement festivities as the finale to what was a spectacular 2022-2023 academic year.
“This semester’s graduating class embodies the diverse, interdisciplinary nature of the School of CSE,” said Regents’ Professor and School of CSE Chair Haesun Park. “We are immensely proud of all of this year’s CSE graduates. They are innovators and problem solvers, ready to take on pressing challenges in the scientific, engineering, social, and medical fields.”
Two School of CSE doctoral candidates walked across the stage at Bobby Dodd Stadium to receive their degrees during the Ph.D. Ceremony.
For Tianfan Fu (Ph.D. CS 2023) and Apaar Shanker (Ph.D. CSE 2023), Commencement was a curtain call for years of vigorous graduate-level research, teaching assistantships and internships, and conference presentations. Fu was advised by School of CSE Adjunct Professor Jimeng Sun. Shanker was advised by Regents’ Professor Surya Kalidindi, joint with the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering and School of CSE.
At the master’s ceremony, three CSE Ph.D. students received diplomas for completing M.S. degrees while in pursuit of their doctorates.
William Kamerow (M.S. CSE 2023) will continue research in high-performance computing, machine learning, and electric propulsion. He is advised by Professor Mitchell Walker, faculty in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering and the College of Engineering’s associate dean for academic affairs.
Shruti Shivakumar (M.S. CSE 2023) is near completion of her Ph.D. in which she researches performant, parallel algorithms for hypergraph analytics. She studies under School of CSE Professor Srinivas Aluru, who is also the executive director of the Institute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS).
Ziyi (Francis) Yin (M.S. CSE 2023) will continue studying under Felix Herrmann, a joint appointment professor with the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and School of CSE. Their group specializes in developing machine learning tools for seismic data acquisition, modeling, imaging, and inversion.
Joining Kamerow, Shivakumar, and Yin are 68 CSE graduates who also completed their M.S. degrees.
Along with students whose home unit is the School of CSE, the School also administers CSE graduate programs for students studying in 12 schools and departments spanning three colleges at Georgia Tech. These affiliations with the School of CSE demonstrate the interdisciplinary and collaborative threads inherently woven into the fabric of a Georgia Tech CSE degree.

Latest NLP Research Derives Insight from Growing Volume of Digital Text
Natural language processing (NLP) is a growing cornerstone of artificial intelligence and allows people and machines to act based on insights gleaned from digital text.
New NLP research from Georgia Tech is allowing for patterns to be uncovered in this text and broaden the understanding of how to build better computer applications that derive value from written language.
Georgia Tech researchers are presenting their latest work at the annual conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2022), taking place this week, July 10-15. NAACL provides a regional focus for members of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) in North America as well as in Central and South America and promotes cooperation and information exchange among related scientific and professional societies.
“Recent advances in natural language processing – especially around big models – have enabled successful applications,” said Diyi Yang, assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing and researcher in NLP. “At the same time, we see a growing amount of evidence and concern toward the negative aspects of NLP systems, such as the bias and fragility exhibited by these models, as well as the lack of input from users.”
Yang’s work in computational social science and NLP focuses on how to understand human communication in social context and build socially aware language technologies to support human-to-human and human-computer interaction.
Her SALT Lab has accrued an impressive number of innovations in the field over the past eight months, starting with research presented at last November’s EMNLP conference. SALTers, as they are called, led Georgia Tech to become the top global contributor in computational social science and cultural analytics at that venue. The 60th Meeting of the ACL in Dublin followed in May with multiple SALT studies, including a best paper. Yang’s group has six papers at this week’s NAACL.
“We hope to build NLP systems that are more user centric, more robust, and more aware of human factors,” said Yang. “Our NAACL works are in this direction, covering robustness, toxicity detection, and generalization to new settings.”
Yang’s aspirations for the field are shared by her Tech peers, who have work in the following tracks at NAACL:
- Ethics, Bias, Fairness
- Information Extraction
- Information Retrieval
- Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP
- Machine Learning
- Machine Learning for NLP
- Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics and Textual Inference
Georgia Tech’s research paper acceptances in the main program at NAACL are below. To learn more about NLP and machine learning research at Georgia Tech visit https://ml.gatech.edu.

School of Computer Science Professor Ellen Zegura is leading the charge to create tools that communities can use to measure cellular coverage in their areas. These measurements will then be combined with measurements from other communities to develop accurate coverage maps.
More details about the grant, researchers, and goals of the project are available in the full story published by Georgia Tech's Research Communications team.
Major Philanthropic Grant Will Create New Center to Advance Open-Source Software
The Georgia Tech College of Computing has received an $11 million grant from Schmidt Futures to create one of the four software engineering centers within the newly launched Virtual Institute for Scientific Software (VISS). The new center will hire half-a-dozen software engineers to write scalable, reliable, and portable open-source software for scientific research.
“Scientific research involves increasingly complex software, technologies, and platforms,” said Alessandro Orso, the software engineer and professor of computer science who is heading up the project. “Also, platforms constantly evolve, and the complexity and amount of data involved is ever-growing.” The center's other leadership includes Irfan Essa, senior associate dean and professor of Interactive Computing, and Jeffrey Young, a research scientist in the School of Computer Science.
The result is that these software systems are often developed as prototypes that are difficult to understand, maintain, and use, which limits their efficacy and ultimately hinders scientific progress.
Software engineers are trained to address these kinds of issues and know how to build high-quality software, but their time is too expensive for a typical research project’s budget. In typical grants, software is often treated as a byproduct of research, meaning that limited funding is allocated for it.
That’s where Schmidt Futures comes in. Schmidt Futures is a philanthropic initiative founded by Eric and Wendy Schmidt that bets early on exceptional people making the world better. They are investing $40 million in VISS over five years at four universities: Georgia Tech, University of Washington, Johns Hopkins University, and University of Cambridge.
“Schmidt Futures’ Virtual Institute for Scientific Software is a core part of our efforts to mobilize exceptional talent to solve specific hard problems in science and society,” said Executive Vice President Elizabeth Young-McNally.
At Georgia Tech, the funds will hire a software engineering lead, as well as three senior and two junior software engineers. A faculty director and an advisory board will help guide the group’s work, which will include collaborations with Georgia Tech scientists.
"We are very proud to host one of the four inaugural Schmidt Futures Virtual Institute of Scientific Software centers,” said Charles Isbell, Dean and John P. Imlay Jr. Chair of Computing.
“Georgia Tech’s center will advance and support scientific research by applying modern software engineering practices, cutting-edge technologies, and modern tools to the development of scientific software. The center will also engage with students and researchers to train the next generation of software engineering leaders.”
Manufacturing, Finance Among Industries to Benefit from What's Next in AI for 2023
Artificial intelligence is already making headlines in the new year with the box office success of the movie M3GAN. Along with a TikTok dance craze and lots of laughs, the over-the-top horror movie/dark comedy about an AI-powered robot that runs amok is also inspiring discussion about the growing presence and impact of artificial intelligence.
From the movie house to the warehouse to your house, AI seems like it's everywhere. That's because with a steady stream of new research and innovative applications reaching into nearly every industry and business sector, it is everywhere. Nevertheless, AI still holds enormous potential as the field continues to evolve.
To get a sense of what this evolution could look like in 2023, we turned to a small group of Ph.D. students from the College of Computing community that are currently pushing foundational and applied AI research forward in a broad spectrum of disciplines and fields.
The students shared their opinions on where AI might be headed in the new year, what some of the big tech stories could be, and why ethics in AI are so critically important.
Where will artificial intelligence and machine learning have the most impact in 2023?
"Artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue to have a huge impact on manufacturing and warehouses with labor shortages and worker turnover continuing to be a concern as more manufacturing and operations jobs are brought back to the United States from overseas. Additionally, AI/ML will continue to help ensure that manufacturing and warehouse facilities are operating as efficiently as possible from energy and material savings to worker safety and parts quality." – Zoe Klesmith Alexander, computational science and engineering Ph.D. student
"Right now, deep learning is on a trajectory to transform the creation space. Artwork and images, videos, data representation and storytelling, co-authoring, and summarizing documents... It's gotten really good." – Ben Hoover, machine learning Ph.D. student
"I think machine learning and AI will keep playing a huge role in how the world and society will be shaped over the next decade in many ways. It will make many other fields more efficient through ML and AI tools we are developing. In 2023, I think ML and AI will have the most impact on social media platforms, helping reduce hate speech, rumor spread, etc." – Agam A. Shah, machine learning Ph.D. student
"One of the big impacts this year may be driverless cars being in your neighborhood. Otherwise, it will be a slow steady drip of GPT3 and other OpenAI models suffusing all applications, making programmers much faster, making journalists faster, making academic articles and lit reviews much faster. We're at a 4th grader level, and I hope by the end of this year we'll be at the 6th grader level. Also, indoor turn-by-turn navigation will be everywhere in 2023 as well." – Brandon Biggs, human-centered computing Ph.D. student
What will be some of the big tech stories in 2023?
"ChatGPT and the GitHub Copilot lawsuit will keep making it into the news and cause more controversies. In general, AI ethics will become more important and get more focus as the technology keeps advancing." – Fabian Fleischer, cybersecurity, and privacy Ph.D. student
"Driverless car fleets will be coming to a city near you. A new battery technology will allow phones to keep their charge for a week. Meta realizes virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays are for a limited market and uses headphones and phones to provide VR experiences." – Brandon Biggs
What’s an issue or industry that you think could benefit from a computing solution?
"Our reinterpretation of modern deep learning as energy-based associative memories has the potential to transform any industry that relies on foundation models -- giant architectures that require models that are "self-supervised" (learn on their own from data)." – Ben Hoover
"Inclusion in everything. Over 90 percent of websites on the internet have elements that are inaccessible to 25 percent of the world's population who have disabilities. Inclusive design will be the most important area where technology can be redesigned and created to have multiple sensory modalities and be properly programmed." – Brandon Biggs
"Currently, financial markets are far from efficient because they do not fully incorporate information available in large unstructured text data. With the latest development in natural language processing techniques, we can better understand the economy and therefore price financial markets better." – Agam A. Shah
There’s been increasing recognition of the vital role ethics should play in artificial intelligence. How do you see this issue evolving in the next year?
"Specifically in my research, I think explainable AI (XAI) is very important, especially if non-experts in ML will be using black-box ML solutions in a factory. It will be important for humans to trust and to understand the models especially if the models are being using to monitor quality on a safety-critical part.
"Additionally, using XAI for human interaction with robots that utilize deep learning to make decisions will be increasingly important as technologies like collaborative robots (cobots) are integrated into factories. I think in my area of research that it is always important to use automation to aid humans in jobs that are safe for humans to do and not to replace them." – Zoe Klesmith Alexander
"Big data is pretty much at its peak. Deep data, where your Alexa knows everything about you, or your phone knows everything about you, and rather than saying 'other people who watched this show liked this show,' it's going to say, 'I know you liked these shows, I think you'll like this show because of these reasons, one of which is because other people who liked all these other shows liked this show.' The ethical element will be how much of this data should these models use, and are people going to build a personal dataset that they can share with other apps, or is each app going to need to build their own dataset? The ethical question is who owns this data." – Brandon Biggs
"I think ethics will become more and more important going forward. We are making huge breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence, but the systems we are creating are producing racist, sexist, and stereotypical results. For example, a recent system, Galactica, developed by Facebook (Meta) is powerful. It can produce research articles by just simply providing it with the title. It comes with some serious ethical concerns, in some cases, it produces racist, sexist text. So, as we will keep developing better models and making success in parallel, we need to always keep in mind the ethical implications of these models." – Agam A. Shah
What research are you working on that you think people should know about or will have impact in 2023?
"Part of my research focuses on data-driven modeling of additive manufacturing processes to better control dimensional quality of the final part. Another part of my research focuses on detecting anomalies in real-time using computer vision and machine learning for both warehouses and manufacturing processes." – Zoe Klesmith Alexander
"Right now, deep learning is built on feed-forward mathematical operations that have little resemblance to the brain. I am working on a physics inspired approach to deep learning built around recurrent networks and energy functions. These architectures have the same mathematical foundation as the famous, biologically plausible Hopfield Network." – Ben Hoover
"I am currently working on two projects which, in my opinion, will have an impact in 2023. In one project, we are measuring the exposure of public firms to ongoing inflation. We are also understanding how inflation affects different firms differently based on the pricing power of the firm. As inflation is the highest in the last 40 years, our study is highly relevant now and in the coming years till we get inflation back in control.
"The second work is related to the first work in some ways. As inflation is rising, to control the inflation Federal Reserve Bank is tightening its monetary policy. In our second work, we are measuring the stance of monetary policy (measuring hawkish vs dovish stance) of the Fed using state-of-the-art NLP models to see its impact in various financial markets (Treasury market, Stock market, Crypto market, etc.)" – Agam A. Shah
Mayor Welcomes AAAI Web and Social Media Conference to Atlanta
Atlanta is hosting the 16th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) next week. The Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center will be the setting for the hybrid conference, which is one of the leading forums for computational social science.
In his welcome letter to ICWSM attendees, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens notes the growing role and importance of computational social science.

Meet CSE Profile: Ph.D. Student Hua Huang
SC22 is right around the corner and several researchers from the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) are presenting at the annual conference.
With this opportunity, we’d like to introduce one of our own, CSE Ph.D. student Hua Huang, to talk about research, Georgia Tech at SC22, and life at the School of CSE.
Student: Hua Huang
Advisor: Edmond Chow
Research Interests: High-performance computing (HPC), parallel computing, computational chemistry
Program Home Unit: CSE
Current Degree Program: Ph.D. in Computational Science and Engineering
Hometown: Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China
Tell us little bit about your research: I mainly work on designing and implementing high-performance and scalable algorithms used in computational chemistry and other scientific computing tasks.
How did you become interested in HPC? When I was in high school, I occasionally read a blog about the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) project. BOINC aggregates a lot of personal computers into a large “supercomputer” for scientific research. This project inspired my interest in scientific computing and high-performance computing.
You’re presenting at SC22. How are you feeling about this? I am very excited after working from home for almost three years. Online meetings are convenient, but face-to-face communication is irreplaceable.
At SC22, you’re presenting a new algorithm called CA3DMM. What should people know about this? Matrix multiplication is a well-studied topic in high-performance computing. It is also a building block of modern artificial intelligence computations. Before CA3DMM, some parallel algorithms already have the optimal cost, but they are hard to understand and implement. CA3DMM uses a new and simple approach and still has the optimal cost.
What interested you about Georgia Tech while applying to graduate programs? Georgia Tech is very strong in STEM. Further, many professors work on high-performance computing and scientific computing in the College of Computing. Therefore, I think Georgia Tech has plenty of opportunities for my interest. A minor reason is that Atlanta is in the south, the weather here is better than that in the north.
You attained your M.S. degree at Georgia Tech in 2019 and are currently pursuing your Ph.D. What do you like about Georgia Tech? The diversity of students. CSE has a lot of interdisciplinary studies, so I met many new friends from different home units. It is very interesting to know the things they are doing.
What are some of your hobbies? Running. I run five miles a day as my daily workout. I like running outside since I can enjoy the beauty of nature and sort out my mind.
Meet CSE Profile: Professor Edmond Chow
2022 has been a busy year for School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Professor Edmond Chow. He was promoted to professor and co-chaired the annual meeting for the Society for Industrial and Applied mathematics (SIAM), all while teaching classes, advising students, and serving as an associate chair for the School of CSE.
Chow recently attended the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC22) where he presented research and chaired a finalist session for the Gordon Bell Special Prize for COVID-19 research. Upon his return to Atlanta, we sat down with him to reflect on a memorable year and his tenure with the School of CSE.
Faculty: Edmond Chow
Position: School of CSE Professor and Associate Chair
Research Interests: Numerical methods for high-performance computers applied to scientific computing and data science problems
Hometown: Toronto, Ontario, Canada
Tell us a bit about your research: I’ve always been interested in science, mathematics, and computing. My research brings all these things together: using mathematical models of physical phenomena and solving these models on a computer. It turns out that the computational expense of solving these models is very high, so we need to efficiently use large, parallel computers. Designing algorithms for solving mathematical models that can run efficiently on complex, high-performance computers is the focus of my research. Useful results in this area can enable computational scientists to understand nature in ways that they couldn’t before.
How did you first become interested in numerical methods? In high school, I was curious about how computers knew how to compute elementary functions, such as sine and cosine. Then I became interested in writing a program that could compute pi to thousands of decimal places. I did not know it at the time, but numerical methods are about how to compute an accurate result without having roundoff error on a computer spoiling your answer. Many methods that are used are surprisingly elegant.
The School of CSE was originally founded as a division in 2005. You came to Georgia Tech in 2010, the same year the CSE Division became the School of CSE. What initially attracted you to Georgia Tech? Georgia Tech had the vision to establish CSE as a separate unit different from computer science and mathematics. Almost no other universities have done that. I admired what Georgia Tech was doing and the people already in CSE at that time. I could not picture myself as a professor in a computer science or math department, but CSE is exactly what I’m trained for and what I want to do.
And what has kept you here for the past 12 years? Using computing to help solve problems in science and engineering is an incredibly fruitful approach to addressing many of the world’s problems, and thus the world needs more people working in computational science and engineering. This was very clear to me in my industrial and laboratory positions before coming to Georgia Tech. Advancing the field of CSE and training students to work in CSE areas are the main reasons I’m here.
You were recently selected as a SIAM Fellow in 2021. What does becoming a fellow mean to you? SIAM has built a community to promote industrial, applied, and computational mathematics, and has given me and others a lot of opportunities to meet people, and for leadership. I’m proud to be part of this community and effort, and it is an honor to be recognized by my peers for my work.
This year at SC22, you and one of your students, Hua Huang, presented a new algorithm called CA3DMM. What should people know about this? CA3DMM is a fast way to perform matrix multiplication on large, distributed memory parallel computers. It’s a lot simpler than comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. The problem was motivated while working with collaborators in computational chemistry. Cross-disciplinary collaborations are a great way to find important problems and interesting ideas.
You’ve been serving as an associate chair for the School of CSE for a little more than a year. What does this role mean for you? This role has helped me see the huge effort it takes among many people to create an environment that fosters learning and research. This effort underscores the service and dedication that is required to sustain or grow such an environment. It has helped me see the excitement that leaders have here about the great things and great possibilities at Georgia Tech.
What are some advantageous or unique aspects of living and working in Atlanta? This is obvious – in the past ten years, even during the pandemic, there has been incredible growth in the midtown area around Georgia Tech. This comes with construction of shiny new buildings and businesses, attracting technical and non-technical people alike. Also, the food scene has become diverse and plentiful in Atlanta. I can also say that Atlanta is becoming friendlier to people on bikes, like me.
What are some of your hobbies? I like playing badminton and squash. During the pandemic, I became interested in making things with microcontrollers. I’ve also recently restarted reading books that don’t contain equations.
Meet CSE Profile: Regents' Professor and Chair Haesun Park
If there is one person that knows the most about the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), it would be Regents’ Professor and Chair Haesun Park.
When Park arrived at Georgia Tech in July 2005, CSE was in its infancy. Degree programs weren’t approved until 2007, and the Division of CSE, as it was known at the time, was not promoted to school status until 2010.
Park has seen a lot of firsts working at the School of CSE since its founding. In fact, she is personally responsible for a number of firsts in the School’s history.
Just to list a few, Park was the School’s first external hire. She was appointed as the first associate chair upon her arrival. And when Park accepted the chair position in 2020, she became the first woman in School history to ascend the role.
As part of our celebration of Women’s History Month 2023, we sat down with Park to learn about what’s kept her at Georgia Tech for nearly two decades, what’s changed in the School, how she manages her professional and personal schedules, and much more.
Faculty: Haesun Park
Position: Regents’ Professor and Chair of School of CSE
Research Interests: Numerical Computing, Data Analytics, Visual Analytics, Text Analysis, Social Network Analysis, Parallel Computing, Bioinformatics
Hometown: Seoul, South Korea
Let’s start at the very beginning. What interested you about coming to Georgia Tech in 2005? When I was at NSF [National Science Foundation] as a Program Director, I learned that Georgia Tech was starting a new school of computational science and engineering. I thought that fit my background in numerical computing and my interest in data analytics at the same time. I thought it was a great opportunity. I applied and came for an interview, and it worked out; I have been here ever since.
And what has kept you here for the past 18 years? The collaborative culture. It was one of the factors that attracted me in the first place. This kind of culture is not easy to find but seemed to come naturally at Georgia Tech. Here, people always pursue innovative directions, are open-minded, and collaborate not only within the school and college, but also across campus. CSE is intrinsically a multidisciplinary area, so the collaborative culture is essential to be successful and I cherish that at Georgia Tech.
What is the biggest difference or change in the School of CSE between 2005 and 2023? We are at the stage that we are growing fast. This creates some challenges, like we don’t have many senior faculty members. But at the same time, our junior faculty members are full of new ideas, volunteer and become more involved in organizing and improving the School. We’re very young right now, dynamic and energetic, and I really enjoy that aspect about us.
What has been the most important constant in the School since 2005? A major factor that attracted me here was the fact that Georgia Tech started CSE as a school. Among all R1 doctoral universities to this day, Georgia Tech remains the only one where CSE exists as an academic unit, like a department or school. While CSE exists in the form of graduate programs or centers or so on at other research-intensive universities, theirs are not departments like ours. That means the faculty here decide our future, we do things based on our own vision, and we have our own faculty lines. We have always been at the forefront of creating and advancing the CSE discipline and that has stayed the same since the beginning.
What do think is the School of CSE’s greatest achievement? CSE research and education programs are built around the five core foundational areas, but at the same time we emphasize working on application areas with real-life impact. The beauty of CSE research is in the virtuous cycle where our foundational methods impact real-life applications and the applications motivate development of new foundational methods. That is one of our biggest strengths.
As mentioned earlier, we’re also on the forefront of leading CSE as an independent academic discipline. There are still open discussions within our field, like what CSE graduate education curriculum should look like, and so on. We have already successfully implemented that, so we’re working on spreading the word that we have created, and are further developing, a successful model.
You are the first woman to be chair of the School. What does this mean to you? I want to be a good role model and source of encouragement for women and underrepresented people, and for everyone in the School for that matter. I think we have been successful in improving diversity and I hope to do even better going forward. Most importantly, diversity does not end just with recruiting people. We will continue to develop better environments where everyone can flourish to their maximum potential as a member of CSE.
On top of being a world-leading researcher and long-standing leader of the School of CSE, you also are married and have a family. What has been the key to success in managing so many aspects of life? In our family, we have very open conversations. Our boys were exposed early to stories and conversations about work, family, whatever is going on, so they understand about what I do in academia and my workload. Sometimes, my professional life becomes hectic because of workload and deadlines, but we’re able to adapt as a family through open communication. My family was pivotal for me to achieve what I wanted to do, and I am very thankful for their patience and love.
Continuing with work-life balance, what are your hobbies or things you do to relax? I have lots of hobbies and I like outdoor activities. My husband and I used to enjoy cross-country skiing, even in five-degree temperature, when we lived in Minnesota. We also like hiking. I like making things, so cooking, fixing things in the house, and learning things online while adding my own ideas to create something new. I also love playing piano, although my skills are becoming rusty in recent years.
Being a resident to the Atlanta area for nearly two decades, what do you like most about living and working in Georgia? I like the nature here and the variety of tree and flowers. The biodiversity is just amazing here. Every time we go hiking, the scenery is different, which is really special. I also like the people here. I find people jovial, open, and easy to talk to, and that gives me a sense of belonging. These aspects make living and working in Georgia enjoyable.
And of course, I love meeting my family on campus. My husband works at Georgia Tech Research Institute and our two sons, who completed undergraduate degrees at Tech, are now doing graduate work here.

In Memoriam: Scholarship Honors Alumnus Sanat Moningi
When Sanat Moningi died in 2018 at the age of 24, his friends and family were not the only ones who felt like the world lost a unique spirit.
Everyone he worked with, helped, or even spoke to knew that there was never going to be another Sanat.
He was one of those people that you couldn’t describe with a word or two. His qualities were unlike most. His actions, thoughts, and words made an impact on this world that many cannot do.
He had three separate memorial services: one held by his family in West Virginia, where he grew up, one at Georgia Tech, where he went to college, and one in San Francisco, where he moved to work afterward. There were many different gatherings and events to honor Sanat.
“That paints a true picture of how many people he impacted,” said Ryan Merklen, who knew Sanat from their time together in Chi Phi. “He always asked what he could do to help those around him.”
In fact, everyone who knew Sanat says the same things about him. The words brilliant, caring, trustworthy, reliable, hilarious, and beautiful were used to describe Sanat. One crucial thing that separated Sanat from others was that he always, from his earliest childhood, knew exactly what he wanted to do in the world: help others.
For the caring person he was, his family is honoring his spirit by endowing the Sanat Moningi Memorial Scholarship, which is being offered for the first time this fall. The scholarship, worth $4,000, will support a student who shares Sanat’s commitment to hard work and to using serving their community.
[APPLY: Sanat Moningi Memorial Scholarship Application Deadline is Nov. 3]
“We think Sanat would be proud of us for doing this for Georgia Tech students,” said his sister, Shalini Moningi.
“This scholarship represents who he was.”
Growing Up Generous
Sanat’s burning curiosity and selfless qualities were already seen at a young age. He offered to build a helper robot for his mother, Dr. Prasuna Jami, so that she could see more patients and spend more time with her children.
“Mom, I don’t want to work like you, all day and all night,” she remembers him saying. “I want to change the world.”
Even at school, Sanat was noticed for his selflessness. In 2011, he attended the American Legion’s Mountaineer Boys’ State program and won the Frank Taylor, Jr. Award for his enthusiastic interest in the law and for displaying high moral character with honor, respect, and integrity.
"San Francisco was blessed to have Sanat for the time we did. He contributed hundreds of hours of volunteer time applying his skills to help others. His contributions will surely impact others for years to come." - Joy Bonaguro, City of San Francisco chief data officer
When his sister was having a tough time adjusting to college, Sanat decided to cheer her up.
“He planned a complete surprise birthday party with our family and friends,” Shalini Moningi said. “I still don’t know how — I mean, he was in eighth grade, he didn’t even have a car.”
“It really meant a lot to me,” she said. “He was a little boy genius, but he was also a lot more. He really cared for people.”
Sanat always made sure to make everyone as happy as they could ever be.
“I remember when I was about 6 or 7, at a family gathering everyone was having fun and all the kids were older than me so they left me out,” his cousin Meenal explained. “As I was sitting in the corner bored, Sanat comes over to me. He starts making jokes and playing with me. Though he was 6 years older than me, he made sure I was having the best time I could have”
The Tech Years
It was obvious that Sanat blossomed at Georgia Tech, both socially and academically. He was the top student in the class and was named the Outstanding Freshman in Computing after his first year. In 2014, he won the ConocoPhillips Innovation Challenge before graduating with honors in 2015. These awards that Sanat got throughout his life are just symbols of the great kid Sanat was.
After his first semester, he joined Chi Phi. His parents were suspicious of fraternities at first, but Sanat’s enthusiasm and success changed their minds.
“I’m very impressed with how much support his friends gave him,” Dr. Jami said. In return, Sanat gave a lot of his time and talents as the fraternity’s philanthropy chair. In his senior year, he won a national award from Chi Phi for his leadership and altruism.
“He set a new standard,” said Merklen. “He connected us to the Boys and Girls Club, to Habitat for Humanity. He encouraged us to always try to place ourselves in our community.”
Sanat’s drive to help also took him into less conventional channels. He spent time tutoring a local high school student in the basics of computing. One Thanksgiving, he and a friend were grabbing dinner when they ran into a homeless man. They brought him back to their dorm and shared their food. This stands for the caring man Sanat was and the love he had towards others.
“He was very empathetically aware,” Merklen said. “It bothered him when he saw someone he couldn’t help.”
The Real World
After graduation, Sanat Moningi moved to San Francisco for a job with Salesforce, where he was quickly promoted to the position of product owner. He moved in with another Salesforce employee, Ryan Flood, and their shared house became the center of a vibrant social scene.
“We had a lot of barbecues,” Flood said. “Sanat would invite anyone and everyone.” Once, a friend showed up at a barbecue in a suit, having come straight from a work function. The next thing Flood saw was that Sanat had changed into a suit to make his friend feel welcome.
He found time to do good as a member of Code for San Francisco, a nonprofit that finds ways to use technology to improve life in the city. Sanat co-founded the nonprofit’s Data Science Working Group, which worked on issues including energy efficiency and housing approvals.
“A couple of years into that, we decided we wanted to do something in the government and politics space full-time,” said Catherine Zhang, a fellow working group member. The two went on to found Voterly, a nonprofit that provided data services to local political campaigns.
They were a couple of months into their new venture when Sanat died accidentally and unexpectedly on April 21, 2018. More than a year later, his parents still hear from people who were touched by Sanat’s kindness.
“He was so intelligent, so successful,” said his sister Shalini. “But the best word to describe him would be caring.”
Sanat used his data science skills since he was in college and developed his knowledge and talent to help the homeless all throughout the nation. He created data science working groups in San Francisco to better care for everyone, as well as projects for the environment and global state. He did all of this as part of his non-profit work.
Moving Forward
Sanat loved Georgia Tech, and Sanat loved to help other people. He truly made a change and to honor his work, dedication, and love, his family, endowing a scholarship in his memory just seemed right.
The Sanat Moningi Memorial Scholarship is for students with at least a 3.0 GPA and a drive to use technology to improve society and help others.
“Sanat wanted to use his intelligence and technical skills to do good for society,” his mother said. “We are looking for someone with a passion to create who also wants to serve society in a creative way.”
Jami said that applicants should know a few other things about Sanat.
“He was selfless, and he never cared about publicity,” she said. “He was goofy sometimes, and other times he was hilarious. He saw problems and solved them on a large scale. He wanted to make a lasting impact in this world and that is just what he did.
“He wanted to use his intelligence to do some good.”

Mobile App Aims to Improve HIV Awareness, Prevention Among Black Women
A new mobile application aims to improve HIV awareness and decrease transmission totals in one of the most highly-impacted demographics in the United States.
With help from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIH), collaborators at Georgia Tech, the Emory School of Nursing, and the Morehouse School of Medicine will refine and test “in-the-kNOW,” a mobile app specifically designed for Black women eligible for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
The goal is to incorporate portable cultural- and context-relevant messaging strategies to close information and awareness gaps in higher-risk populations. To achieve this, the app offers personalized messaging to promote HIV preventative behaviors among its users.
Statistics show that Black women have the second-highest rate of all new HIV infections in the United States, accounting for 69 percent of all HIV diagnoses among women in the South. In a preliminary study, participants endorsed the mobile app intervention and expressed a desire for a fully developed and integrated version.

Thanks to a $709,000 grant from the NIH, researchers will refine the app and evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and usability among real-world users. The research needed to further develop the app will be conducted in Cobb, Dekalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett Counties, which all have high rates of new HIV cases.
Andrea Grimes Parker, Georgia Tech’s lead collaborator on the project, will receive a share of the grant worth $229,000. She is one of three primary collaborators. The others are Dr. Rasheeta Chandler of the Emory School of Nursing, the principal investigator, and Dr. Natalie Hernandez of the Morehouse School of Medicine.
The project, set to last three years, is titled In-the-kNOW (Novel Approaches to Optimizing Women’s Health): A Mobile Application to Optimize HIV Prevention and Sexual/Reproductive Health Communication Among Black Women in the Southern U.S.
New $20 Million NSF Award Paves the Way for AI Innovation in Cybersecurity
Over the next four years a national team of researchers will establish the AI Institute for Artificial Cyber Threat Intelligence and Operation (ACTION) through a $20 million award from the National Science Foundation with the intent of adapting artificial intelligence technologies to cybersecurity practices.
Wenke Lee, John P. Imlay Jr. chair and professor at the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy, will represent Georgia Tech as one of the co-principal investigators for the project, which aims to improve how essential business technologies are protected from evolving cyber threats.
“This NSF AI Institute is a really exciting opportunity because it enables us to explore new ideas and develop novel technical approaches and educational content at the intersection of AI and Cybersecurity,” said Lee. “Our team of researchers in multiple disciplines from several leading universities will be collaborating very closely and I expect to learn a lot from them throughout the project.”
Lee will collaborate with the second co-principal investigator from Georgia Tech, Xiaoming Huo, A. Russell Chandler III professor in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering. The two will jointly supervise several Ph.D. students and co-develop new course materials and projects to broaden the impact of their research.
“Cybersecurity research ascends as a groundbreaking sphere in data science, encompassing a myriad of captivating and rigorous topics,” said Huo. “Pioneering innovation remains crucial, and I am eagerly anticipating the opportunities that this grant will bring, ushering in a new epoch in the field.”
Researchers will work across disciplines to develop new approaches to artificial intelligence that is informed by and works with security experts. The AI tools developed by ACTION will perform security tasks quickly and accurately while anticipating potential moves made by adversaries. The AI will counteract the possible attacks in a way that protects computer network security and ensures people’s safety.
The work done by ACTION will also include an outreach component. The results from the project are anticipated to innovate education from K-12 to postdoctoral students. Many of the new AI and cybersecurity tools developed will be applied to workforce development, collaboration opportunities among academic organizations, and industry partners.
Researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara will take the lead on this project. They will collaborate with Georgia Tech, Purdue University, the University of California, Berkeley, University of Chicago, University of Washington, University of Virginia, Rutgers University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Illinois Chicago, and Norfolk State University. Georgia Tech will receive $1.5 million from this grant.
New AI Method Lets Robots Get By With a Little Help From Their Friends
New artificial intelligence (AI) research is using deep learning to improve the efficiency of communications between AI-enabled agents – like robots, drones, and self-driving cars – that are working together to solve computer vision and perception tasks.
Within the new multi-stage communications deep learning framework developed by researchers from the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech, a robot drone with a blocked view of a collapsed building, for example, can query its teammates until it finds one with relevant details to fill in the blanks.
“The current model is for all agents to be talking to all agents at the same time, a fully connected network, via high bandwidth connection, even when it’s not necessary. Our goal is to maximize accuracy of perception tasks, while minimizing bandwidth usage,” said Zsolt Kira, associate director of the Machine Learning Center and an assistant professor in the College of Computing.
For the specific perception task of classifying each pixel of an image, known as semantic segmentation, Kira says that the new framework has achieved this goal by improving accuracy by as much as 20 percent while using just a fourth of the bandwidth required by current state-of-the-art models.
“Rather than communicating all at once, in our model, each agent learns when, with whom, and what to communicate in order to complete an assigned perception task as efficiently as possible,” said Kira, who advises machine learning (ML) Ph.D. student Yen-Cheng Liu, lead researcher on the project.
The new approach limits the amount of communications needed by breaking down the process into three stages within the team’s deep learning framework.
In the request stage, the robot with the blocked view or with a degraded sensor sends an extremely small query to each of its teammates. In the matching stage, the other agents evaluate the query to see if they have relevant information to share with the initiator.
“We refer to this as a handshake mechanism to determine if communication is even needed in the first place and if it is, what information to transmit, and who to send it to,” said Kira.
During the connect stage the initiating robot integrates details provided to it from its teammates to fill the gaps in its own observations. The agent then uses this update to improve its estimates for the overall task.
For the study, the research team – which includes ML Ph.D. students Junjiao Tian, and Nathaniel Glaser – developed a training dataset within AirSim, an open-source simulator for drones, cars, and other autonomous or semiautonomous vehicles. The multi-view dataset, known as AirSim-MAP, is based on data gathered from a team of five virtual drones flying through a dynamic landscape. Data captured includes RGB image, depth maps, pose, and semantic segmentation masks for each agent.
“We’ll be releasing this dataset soon to allow other researchers to explore similar problems,” said Kira, director the Robotics Perception and Learning lab, where the study was completed.
The results of the team’s work are being presented virtually this week at the 2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation in a paper titled Who2com: Collaborative Perception via Learnable Handshake Communications. The research is supported by a grant from the Office of Naval Research (N00014-18-1-2829.
New AI Research Initiatives Sprout Thanks to Emory/Georgia Tech Seed Grants
Two College of Computing faculty members are among the inaugural recipients of $100,000 seed grants from a collaborative program by Emory University and Georgia Tech.
Associate professors Jacob Abernethy and Rosa Arriaga each earned grants from the AI.Humanity Seed Grant Program, which is part of an existing partnership between the two universities. The funding is meant to foster artificial intelligence (AI) research to find solutions to real-world challenges that impact daily life.
Abernethy, based in the School of Computer Science, and his Emory partner, anthropology assistant professor Marcela Benítez, will use the seed grant to fund their proposal AI Forest: Cognition in the Wild. The pair plans to create and deploy “smart” testing stations for long-term cognitive assessment and monitoring of wild capuchin monkeys at the Taboga Forest Reserve in Costa Rica.
The testing stations will leverage AI and deep learning to recognize and track monkeys in real-time. This means individuals can be targeted for behavioral assessment and cognitive testing. The stations will also provide a new approach to long-term monitoring of cognitive abilities in wild animals, which will provide the team with an unprecedented level of control in a wild environment. This in turn will provide new opportunities for several studies linking cognitive performance to natural behaviors and ultimately overall fitness.
Arriaga is based in the School of Interactive Computing. She and her partner, Dr. Marcos Schechter from the Emory School of Medicine, will use the seed funding to develop a diabetic ulcer computational sensing system. The goal is to build computational models that can detect changes in diabetic foot ulcers and provide AI-driven interfaces that connect patients and clinicians.
To address the current clinical challenges of automating wound screening and monitoring, the human-centered computational sensing system proposed by the team will characterize ulcer severity and wound progression, and predict wound healing and recurrence.
Additionally, the team will focus on underserved and minority communities to promote technologies to reduce disparities. This pilot proposal will enroll people from underserved communities at Grady Memorial Hospital, a public hospital where over 250 people are hospitalized with diabetic foot ulcers annually.
“These teams are partnering to revolutionize AI and promote equity and improvement of the overall quality of human life,” said Deborah Bruner, senior vice president for Research at Emory University. “This is an exciting time for research departments at Emory and Georgia Tech.”
"This opportunity leverages our universities' combined strengths in AI, health, and cognition research,” said Rob Butera, Georgia Tech vice president for Research Development and Operations. “Emory and Georgia Tech have a long history in collaborating and AI.Humanity pushes these collaborations into new domains."
A third team research pair also received AI.Humanity funding for their proposal.
John Taylor, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering Frederick Law Olmsted Professor, and Emory public health professor Lance Waller will use the seed grant for their project Applying Machine Learning Techniques to Improve Epidemiological Models Accounting for Urban Infrastructure Networks, Human Behavioral Change, and Policy Interventions.
New Algorithm Follows Human Intuition to Make Visual Captioning More Grounded
Annotating and labeling datasets for machine learning problems is an expensive and time-consuming process for computer vision and natural language scientists. However, a new deep learning approach is being used to decode, localize, and reconstruct image and video captions in seconds, making the machine-generated captions more reliable and trustworthy.
To solve this problem, researchers at the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) and Facebook have created the first cyclical algorithm that can be applied to visual captioning models. The model is able to use the three-step processing during training to make the model more visually-grounded without human annotations or introducing additional computations when deployed, saving researchers time and money on their datasets.
New Algorithm Perseveres in Search for Data Anomalies on Mars
Searching for evidence of life on Mars is making an impact here on Earth. One way this is being achieved is through development of data science tools successfully tested on the Mars Perseverance rover, which could be applied to interpret large, complex datasets on our own planet.
In a recent paper, a collaborative team of School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) researchers and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) scientists introduce a design methodology, called ISHMAP, to develop new data anomaly detection models.
Though implemented on the Perseverance rover as it explores for new discoveries on the Red Planet, ISHMAP’s greater impact will be its applicability for terrestrial life here at home who work in the rocketing field of scientific data science.
“We have shown that collaboratively framing a data science problem with the relevant domain experts may be much more important than the actual data modeling when it comes to the ultimate impact of a model,” said Austin Wright, a School of CSE Ph.D. student. “That is to say, really working hard to precisely form the right question is, in many ways, more important than the model used to try and answer it.”
ISHMAP stands for Iterative Semantic Heuristic Modeling of Anomalous Phenomena. In essence, ISHMAP is a process for scientists and researchers to produce natively interpretable anomaly detection models.
The framework is the culmination of more than 30 months of collaborative research between CSE and JPL through Wright’s internship.
Here, the ISHMAP group partnered with the NASA team that manages Perseverance’s Planetary Instrument for X-Ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) instrument, a fluorescence spectrometer that studies elemental composition data of the Martian surface.
The highlight of ISHMAP’s development is a highly accurate spectral anomaly algorithm that resulted in a 93.4% accuracy rate when detecting diffraction anomalies. What started as a yearlong field deployment of the toolkit is now a regular component of the PIXL team’s workflow.
In fact, more than 97 NASA and NASA-affiliated scientists around the globe currently use a visualization tool embedded with the algorithm, thus proving itself as a key contributor in finding discoveries on Mars and elsewhere in our galaxy.
“ISHMAP can provide a strong structure to make sure scientists know what the model is doing and is guaranteed to be addressing something that they are interested in,” Wright said. “By contributing through the whole process, they have built-in levels of trust and ownership rather than just having some extra feature foisted upon them.”
The ISHMAP team joining Wright includes his advisor, School of CSE Associate Professor Polo Chau, as well as Adrian Galvin and Scott Davidoff from JPL. Peter Nemere, a programmer at Queensland University of Technology, also co-authored the paper.
The ISHMAP algorithm analyzes anomalies in crystal structures. These reveal aspects of geological and geochemical history that indicate suitability of life, such as past presence of water and essential minerals. This is a specific component of the PIXL instrument that searches for elemental traces of ancient microbial life on Mars in datasets collected in surveys, scans, and samples.
As scientific datasets grow larger and more complex, so too do the methods used to find anomalies. Existing anomaly detection research primarily relies on deep learning methods, but these tend to lack nuance and interpretability, which are vital to scientific inquiry.
ISHMAP bridges methodologies from artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) into a framework for scientific researchers to use in designing more effective and interpretable anomaly detection tools.
An important early stage in the ISHMAP process was an 18-month-long formative design study between the ISHMAP group and NASA’s PIXL team. This defined the design goals needed to enhance PIXL.
To accomplish its mission, PIXL needed an algorithm that focused on raw data over processed data, robustness to operate under a limited amount of ground truth data, and enhanced ability to interpret and differentiate different kinds of anomalies.
Buy-in from users proved to be a key step in the early stages of the methodology to understand research problems and to integrate with existing model techniques. This way, ISHMAP produces an effective anomaly detection algorithm custom made to meet end-user needs.
To help spread the word about ISHMAP and attract more scientific users, Wright represented the group by presenting their research at the 28th Annual Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2023).
An Association for Computing Machinery conference held March 27 – 31 in Sydney, IUI 2023 is a premier international forum reporting outstanding research at the intersection of HCI and AI to further develop user interfaces.
“I think that researchers can consider using ISHMAP simply because these kinds of collaboration between data scientists and domain scientists are difficult,” Wright said. “A resource like ISHMAP can give structure to both parties, and make the whole process easier and more likely to result in good science.”
New Alumna Ready for Cybersecurity Fray, Encourages Girls Interested in CS
Cybersecurity and privacy threats are on the rise. So is the cost for U.S. companies falling prey to online criminals. In 2002, the average cost of a data breach in the U.S. is $9.4 million. This is up by 13% from 2020, according an annual report from IBM.
There is a bright spot for business, however. The report reveals that the average cost of a data breach is reduced by a third for companies using artificial intelligence (AI) and automation strategies to protect their data systems. This means companies are scrambling to hire people with specialized skills that can develop and maintain complex systems to counter threats that constantly mutate to find new attack vectors.
Well-poised to take advantage of the skyrocketing workforce demand is Antonia Nunley, who graduates this week from Georgia Tech with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (CS) degree.
Nunley focused her studies on systems architecture and enterprise data management. She has interned twice with Salesforce as part of a threat detection team. And she is set to intern again with the company in 2023.
“My passion is security. Next summer, I will be working in offensive security. My goal for the internship is a full-time offer so I can return in January 2024 to work in San Francisco for Salesforce,” says Nunley, who was a member of GreyHat, Georgia Tech’s cybersecurity club.
Based on what she’s experienced with her internships and her coursework at Georgia Tech, Nunley thinks one of the big cybersecurity stories in 2023 could be a breakthrough in automated incident protection and response for large data enterprises.
“The goal is to develop AI models that can make scripts with a language that will effectively describe what a vulnerability or incident would look like. Pair this with the AI capabilities to respond to and fix incidents in enterprise software, and companies will be able to react almost instantly to any security breaches,” says Nunley, a 2019 graduate of Brookstone School in Columbus, Georgia.
Nunley says her interest in cybersecurity and CS started at an early age. Her mother also majored in computer science. Although she worked as a nurse, she was always working on computing projects at home.
“I grew up around computers and knew this was exactly what I wanted to do. I was the president of the Girls Who Code Club, and I took every computer science course offered in high school,” says Nunley.
She confirmed her decision to study CS in college during her junior year in high school. “I went to a two-week cybersecurity camp at Embry Riddle University. I wanted to see all that computer science had to offer outside of software engineering, and I absolutely loved it. After this experience, I toured Georgia Tech and fell in love with it.”
Although she had a passion for CS, Nunley wasn’t sure when she first came to Georgia Tech if she would make any female friends also majoring in CS. Much to her surprise, however, Nunley began to realize that there were more women interested in the field than she had initially thought.
“You can’t let the stereotypes scare you; there are a lot more women in the field than you think,” says Nunley, who worked as a teaching assistant for five semesters supporting for the School of Computing Instruction’s Data Structures & Algorithms I (CS 1332) course.
“I was worried that I wouldn't be able to make any close female friends in the major because of how male dominated it seems on the outside. But, for young women thinking about majoring in computer science, I can say that you will not be alone. We stick together and help each other.”
New Alumni Explores His Culture Through Computational Media
As an Atlanta native, Sammy Otoo always dreamed of coming to Tech. Although he had imagined himself becoming a computer science major, Otoo fell in love with computational media on a visit.
“The opportunity to not only learn computer science skills, but also history, media, culture, design, and communication skills, was a dream come true,” he said. His major has allowed him to explore his many passions, which include photography, music, and video game design. It has also helped him apply computer skills to real-life situations.
Some of Otoo’s favorite classes may at first seem unrelated. One was CS 3750, which covers user interface design and how humans interact with their computers. Another was HTS 3025, the history of African Americans after 1865. For Otoo, a variety in curriculum let him create unique projects such as a short film.
“I want to stay involved in creative projects because I have not had as much time making music as I would like,” he said. Culture is important to him and media is a way to express his background in new ways.
As a child of Ghanaian parents, his family’s experiences help shape his creative projects. With access to studio quality equipment, he has been able to bring his culture into the Tech community. His short film, The Bench, premiered in April and served as a reflective moment as his time at Tech was ending. “Be intentional about your time and how much you have available,” Otoo advises.
Otoo will spend the summer following graduation traveling throughout South Africa as part of the OMED Diversity Abroad and Global Innovation Project. This will be the first cohort of the program.
New Approach to Review Sessions Increases Student Attendance
A School of Computing Instruction (SCI) senior lecturer is set to present her ‘À La Carte’ recitation program to faculty from around the world at a leading conference in Toronto, Ontario Canada this week.
SCI Senior Lecturer Melinda McDaniel is sharing details about a novel approach that she and her teaching assistants developed to encourage student participation in review sessions. She is presenting Saturday at the Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education hosted by the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE).
The new concept was developed during the pandemic when online students were attending virtual lectures but skipping online review sessions. “This talk is about something I tried during the pandemic. I taught synchronously and students came and listened to me. If they wanted to find out more later, they would just watch the recording again,” McDaniel said. “After the first couple of weeks though, students didn’t want to go to the recitation review session, which was yet another video.”
Recitation is a study lab for a particular course typically led by teaching assistants (TAs). While students aren’t required to attend, these sessions have been a crucial step for students who have succeeded in courses like McDaniel’s Data Manipulation for Science and Industry (CS2316). This class teaches Python and Structured Query Language (SQL) skills.
Seeing participation drop off at the outset of the pandemic, McDaniel consulted with her teaching assistants (TAs) on ways to make recitation more engaging for students.
The TAs took the challenge for action. Moving beyond just being a review session for the course, the TAs developed a weekly menu of lab topics that students can choose from – à la carte – based on their needs. Lab topics follow McDaniel's course and include material reviews, problem solving, industry relevance, and exam prep sessions.
Each of the weekly topics is coordinated and led by the TA that contributed the idea. It didn’t take long before a friendly competition emerged among the TAs to drive attendance numbers by adding games, competitions, guest speakers, and themes.
“The à la carte approach offers a lot of versatility. Students can pick exactly what they feel they need,” CS 2316 Teaching Assistant Jacob Schroeder said.
Participation in the sessions has dramatically increased since implementing the new framework, even as sessions are now held in person. For example, one week showed 135 out of 159 students attended labs with a majority choosing material review sessions. The driving force has been giving students choices instead of assigning them to a lab.
“Recitation attendance has been a challenge for years,” said Olivia Lawson, who is also a CS 2316 Teaching Assistant. “But this has been the strongest and most consistent attendance I’ve seen in a really long time and that’s encouraging.”
In addition to McDaniel’s presentation on recitations, she’s also representing SCI with Inaugural Chair Olufisayo Omojokun and Associate Chair Mary Hudachek-Buswell. The team is presenting their proven methods of finding, hiring, and retaining TAs. SCI faculty members teach all 1000- and 2000- courses required for all Georgia Tech undergraduates, as well as several upper-level courses. Nearly 400 TAs support SCI faculty each semester.
The SIGCSE Technical Symposium addresses problems common among educators working to develop, implement, and evaluate computing programs, curricula, and courses. The symposium provides a forum for sharing new ideas for syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy, at all levels of instruction. The symposium is being held March 15-18.
“Now that we’re a school, we want to share our knowledge,” McDaniel said. “We have a responsibility to share what we’re doing here with other schools. That’s what this is all about.”
New Book on Future of Online Education Draws on Faculty OMSCS Experience
Charles Isbell and David Joyner have written a book on the power and potential of online education. The Distributed Classroom, which published on Sept. 14, presents a hybrid education model where faculty and students can thrive in an increasingly virtual world.
“As educators, we have found ourselves in a new world,” said Isbell, who is dean of the College of Computing and the John P. Imlay Jr. Chair. “Even those of us who have thought hard about a future with a more online, more asynchronous, and more distributed set of students are dealing with this reality faster than we expected, and scrambling to keep up.”
Isbell and Joyner, who is executive director of online education, are more than qualified to offer a solution as both are instructors (and Isbell a founder) for Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS), an online only MS degree program that was launched in 2014.
“What is so revolutionary about OMSCS is when you take away all these structural obstacles—Atlanta, tuition, pace of a regular degree—you make it more accessible, allow more students in, and reduce cost," Joyner said. "It’s a snowball effect, but the question is can you do this built from what you’re doing already?”
Joyner first expressed the pair’s ideas in an editorial for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2020 on the possibilities of hybrid education. “But as we adjust to the widespread impacts of the pandemic, there is a better question we should be asking: why would we go back to normal?” he wrote. “Was what we were doing before the best we could do, or can this moment be the catalyst for something better?”
The book answers that question by proposing that hybrid on its own isn’t the answer, but a deliberately designed distributed model may be. Isbell and Joyner suggest that educators find ways to share more of what is already happening in-person with a remote audience. Having qualified teaching assistants to support a dedicated online student experience is also key to the success of a distributed classroom.
This model allows classes to admit more students and in-person teaching organically enables content to be refreshed. It also creates flexibility for everyday issues such as instructor illness, conference travel, or students taking the class asynchronously in other areas.
“It's a great model for how to take a class and distribute it to more students, make participation more flexible, and protect against the pandemic or other interruptions — all without doing a lot of additional work,” Joyner said. “We think this is where we are going in 20 years anyway, but the pandemic has given us an opportunity to experiment with this a lot faster.”
Joyner sees the audience for their book as administrators, instructors, students, and instructional designers—essentially anyone interested in a distributed classroom experience.
“There are tools that can help, and there are skills we can all learn,” Isbell said. “More importantly, there is a mindset that we can develop that will help us to not only deal with this new reality, but to provide a better experience and a better education for more learners.”
New Bugs Identified in Popular Programming Language
During a six-and-a-half-hour implementation, a new static analysis tool created at Georgia Tech doubled the number of known memory safety bugs in the Rust programming language.
Developed over the course of three years, the tool, known as Rudra, recently received the distinguished artifact award during the ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles.
Rust is a general-purpose programming language for creating software applications and is managed by a community of volunteer coders. Within Rust exist two areas, safe and unsafe code. According to Yechan Bae, Ph.D. student at the Georgia Tech School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP), Rudra is designed to search the safe and unsafe areas of Rust for memory safety bugs that may have eluded developers.
“When a program is written entirely in safe Rust, its compiler automatically guarantees memory safety,” said Bae. “On the other hand, if a program contains unsafe Rust, it is up to the programmer to guarantee memory safety.”
While programmers do their best to secure their code, Bae explained bugs can still slip through and compromise the safety of a program. Despite its sinister label, unsafe Rust is just the part of the language that isn’t covered under Rust’s memory safety guarantee. It is still regularly used by developers to write low-level systems software.
“Memory safety problems in Rust are the most subtle burden to developers writing secure programs,” said SCP Associate Professor Taesoo Kim. “Rudra helps all Rust programmers audit their projects in the unsafe parts of the Rust and discover potential memory bugs in an early phase. Its algorithm is fast and causes small false positives, allowing us to scale Rudra to all the Rust packages in its registry.”
Bae and his team identified three common bug patterns in unsafe Rust- panic safety, high-order invariant, and send/sync variance bugs- and created two new algorithms to detect them. Rudra was implemented as a custom Rust compiler using high-level intermediate representations and mid-level intermediate representations to detect the identified bugs.
“The two goals of Rudra were to identify the common security bugs throughout Rust and for the tool to be used daily by Rust users,” said Bae. “Our research helped developers and advised Rust security advisors of the existing threats.”
Rudra analyzed 43,000 Rust packages in its repository and found 264 unknown memory safety bugs throughout the Rust ecosystem. Two of these bugs were discovered in the Rust standard library, one in the official futures package. Rudra also detected an issue with Rust’s Compiler.
The research was presented by Bae at the 28th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles. The paper, Rudra: Finding Memory Safety Bugs in Rust at the Ecosystem Scale, is co-authored by Yechan Bae, Youngsuk Kim, Ammar Askar, Jungwon Lim, and Taesoo Kim. The project was announced as the Distinguished Artifact Award winner at the beginning of the conference. The open-source software is available for free at https://github.com/sslab-gatech/Rudra.
A New Cohort of Cyber Students Are Ready to Change the World
On Friday, 18 Georgia Tech students graduated with a Master of Science in Cybersecurity (MS Cybersecurity) degree.
Around one-third of the graduates are women, and they come from at least half a dozen countries. These newly minted MS Cybersecurity graduates are set to work for companies ranging from Apple to startups.
The following students have petitioned to graduate for Fall 22: Abdulrahman Albattah, Abhro Bhuniya, Klay Brown, Constantine Caras, Paras Chetal, Harini Dandu, Somya Doshi, Patrick Erdmann, Jeffrey Ho, Nathan Jaco, Diego Juarez, Rayan Kashghari, Himani Mukne, Chaitanya Rahalkar, Shree Raksha, Harsh Singh, Anushka Virgaonkar, and Ting-Wei Wang.
The School of Cybersecurity and Privacy at Georgia Tech was formed in September 2020. It is one of five schools in the top-ranked College of Computing, and it builds on the strong foundation and continued success of the cybersecurity research, education, and service efforts at Georgia Tech that began more than 20 years ago.
The school's work is interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, with many current faculty members having joint appointments with other schools in the College of Computing, as well as with the School of Computational Science and Engineering within the College of Engineering, the Scheller College of Business, the School of Public Policy, and the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, both in the Ivan Allen College of the Liberal Arts.
New Computer Science Rankings Support Efforts to Bring Top Talent to Campus
A new ranking places Georgia Tech’s computer science program among the top three percent of programs on the planet.
The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings this week released its 2022 rankings for computer science. According to the 2022 THE rankings, Georgia Tech is No.21 in the world for computer science and No. 14 in the world for engineering.
“Ranking among the top three percent of CS program in the world is significant and is consistent with our top-10 rankings in US News & World Report. These rankings help us to continue to attract the best and brightest staff, students, and faculty, and they reflect the underlying reality that the college continues to be recognized for its impact on the world,” said Charles Isbell, College of Computing dean and John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
Overall, the 2022 THE rankings examined 1,600 institutions located in 99 countries. Of those, 891 institutions were ranked for computer science. Last month, U.S. News and World Report ranked Georgia Tech No. 5 nationally for computer science in its 2021 Best College rankings.
New Computing Approach May Save At-Risk Carnival Costume Making Tradition
Costumes in the annual Trinidad and Tobago Carnival often inspire awe because of their extravagance, flamboyancy, and — for some dancing sculptures — their size.
Some costumes are so large and expansive, it makes the person wearing them appear as if they are carrying an unbelievably heavy load on their shoulders. Built on techniques in the traditional craft of wire-bending, these costumes and dancing sculptures are dynamic and performative and decorated with painted textiles, feathers, and beads.
Wire-bending has been a traditional method of constructing costumes for the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival since the 1930s, but Vernelle A.A. Noel, a joint professor with the School of Interactive Computing in the College of Computing and School of Architecture in the College of Design, has been conducting research on this at-risk practice.
Three masters of the craft have passed away since Noel began her research in 2012. Most recently, Albert Bailey, one of the masters who assisted Noel with her research, passed away in September. Those who are still alive are getting older.
“The craft is dying because of aging practitioners, the absence of a system to pass this knowledge on, and more,” Noel said. “There is currently no system of pedagogy for it to be passed on, so this was the first problem I addressed in my research. How do we document and make explicit this tacit knowledge in wire benders so that it can be shared and taught to others?
“This material practice is a language. For the continued telling of histories and cultures, these languages, which are ways of understanding and describing the world, should not disappear.”
Noel believes it’s possible to revive the craft through computational approaches.
Noel will be hosting her first physical exhibition, Design and Making in the Trinidad Carnival: Histories, Re-imaginations, and Speculations of Computational Design Futures, from Nov. 17 to Feb. 28, 2023, at the Price Gilbert Memorial Library at Georgia Tech.
The exhibition is funded by the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts and showcases wire-bending through traditional and technological forms of making.
“Specifically, I’m looking at wire-bending and how we can rethink craft, computation, and computers,” Noel said.
Noel, who was born in Trinidad and Tobago, began her research in wire-bending during her graduate studies.
“I grew up looking at Carnival,” she said. “I always knew it was deep and rich, but during my graduate studies, I started to look at the scholarly side of Carnival and realized there was a gap in scholarship in terms of design,” she said. “I wanted to understand, unpack, and reveal what was there.
“At first, I focused more on the design and fabrication side of things, but it became much more than that. I’m a constant observer of how cultures change. The question started with an aesthetic change that I noticed that was different from the aesthetics of the past. I noticed that the aesthetics of Carnival were trending toward bikinis, beads, and feathers, and I wanted to know why. My hypothesis was that it was a design problem among the people, processes, knowledge, tools, methods, economies, and more.
Traditionally, the practice of wire-bending is a male-dominated practice, but Noel believes integrating computer technologies in the craft might make it more accessible to children, women, and those with physical limitations.
As she designed and produced her first exhibition, Noel said she had to think about what she wanted spectators to walk away with after viewing it.
“Craft practices can help us rethink technology, and technology can help us rethink craft practices,” she said. “The work also gives voice to the contributions of cultures and people who are often excluded from discourses in computation and technology.
“I’m looking forward to hearing how the work is received. I want people to feel the joy I felt curating, designing, and making it. I want them to be curious, to think across worlds and disciplines. I want them to acknowledge and appreciate this history.”
New Data Visualizations Let Users Explore CSCW 2021 Connections
A microsite developed by the College is putting a spotlight on Georgia Tech’s participation in CSCW 2021, the 24th annual Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, which begins tomorrow and is being held virtually for the second consecutive year.
This year, Georgia Tech’s presence at CSCW includes 18 accepted papers from faculty and student authors. Of these, three are being recognized as best paper honorable mentions.
Along with brief descriptions and research vignettes about these papers, the microsite includes three interactive data visualizations. These visualizations not only cover Tech’s research but also allow users to explore and find connections among all accepted research papers and authors representing institutions and organizations from around the world participating in CSCW 2021.
The virtual conference, which begins Saturday and ends on Oct. 27, focuses on research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks, and explores the social and theoretical challenges of designing new technologies.
New Device Cuts Cost of Digitizing Whiteboard Content
Despite almost two years of online education, digitally capturing a whiteboard is still a challenge. Now, Georgia Tech researchers have created an attachment that can replicate any writing instrument’s movements.
The tool uses wireless location, inertial sensors, and pressure sensing to determine where the pen is on the board and digitize those movements to stream to a computer. Costing only $100-$150, it’s nearly a tenth of the price of a smartboard. For an hour lecture, it uses just 1.5 MB of data, which is about 400 times smaller than filming the whole board.
Before this innovation, the two primary ways of digitizing content both had logistical problems. While a smartboard is accurate, it’s often prohibitively expensive for most school budgets. Although filming video of the whiteboard is more cost-effective, it results in large video files that don’t transfer well over low internet speeds. The potential inequity of this among students inspired the researchers to work on solutions.
“Not being able to digitize the whiteboard increases the learning gap,” said School of Computer Science Assistant Professor Ashutosh Dhekne. “If you have a good internet connection, you can see the whiteboard clearly in a video, but if you don’t, the learning experience deteriorates quickly.”
The researchers focused on making the experience seamless for the teacher. So, they decided not to modify the whiteboard or tip of pen itself but focus on attachments.
The attachment needs to sense where the pen was as a person wrote. Location tracking alone isn’t sufficient, so the researchers relied on a fusion sensor approach:
- Inertial sensors: Each sensor contains an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer that can determine the exact orientation of the pen on a larger frame of reference, in this case, the whiteboard.
- Wireless radio technology: This tracks how far a pen is from the fixed wireless antenna sensors at the border of the whiteboard.
- Pressure sensor: This sensor detects when the pen touches the whiteboard surface, based on how much pressure is coming from the user’s grip.
The researchers believe this attachment could be used for more than just online learning and meetings; it could be also attached to scalpels or paintbrushes for medical or art instruction.
“Documenting the process of creating something by hand is difficult, but this tool has the potential to make that possible,” Dhekne said.
Dhekne, SCS Professor Mostafa Ammar, and SCS Ph.D. student Yifeng Cao presented the research in the paper, ITrackU: Tracking a Pen-like Instrument via UWB-IMU Fusion, at The 19th ACM International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services (MobiSys) in June.
New Director Named for One of the Country's Top Interdisciplinary Math Ph.D. Programs
As one of the best discrete mathematics and combinatorics graduate programs in the country, Georgia Tech’s Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) doctoral program has long been known for its excellence and rigor.
Newly appointed director Santosh Vempala plans to both “ensure that the program maintains its high quality — and make it desirable for a diverse student population.”
“The ACO program is special both at Georgia Tech and in the world,” shares Vempala, who serves as professor and Frederick G. Storey Chair in the College of Computing with joint appointments across the School of Computer Science, School of Mathematics, and the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISYE). “The community of students, thanks to the dedicated and insightful work of previous directors, is thriving, both while they are here at Georgia Tech and after they graduate. They have been exceptionally successful.”
Founded in 1991, the ACO program is housed jointly across the College of Computing, the School of Mathematics in the College of Sciences, and ISYE in the College of Engineering. Focused on topics like graph theory, algorithms, discrete optimization — and the interplay between the three — the program has deeply embraced its multidisciplinary nature, essentially eliminating “the traditional walls that usually separate academic units” by encouraging faculty members to advise students regardless of departmental affiliation.
ACO “brings together three disciplines that are fundamentally related,” Vempala explains. “Its course structure enables students to understand phenomena from all three perspectives and learn to use tools from all of them.”
Vempala has been involved with the ACO program since he joined the Georgia Tech faculty in 2006, advising many students in ACO, as well as serving on committees within the program.
“Professor Vempala's experience at Georgia Tech, including his prior service as associate director of the ACO program, means that he is uniquely qualified to serve as director,” shares David Collard, professor in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry and senior associate dean in the College of Sciences. “The program is highly regarded nationally and internationally. It attracts superb students from around the world and provides exceptional educational opportunities. I look forward to its continued success under professor Vempala's leadership."
Meet Santosh Vempala
Vempala received his Ph.D. in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization at Carnegie Mellon University before spending a year as a Miller Fellow at University of California, Berkeley and a decade as a professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Upon joining the faculty at Georgia Tech, Vempala served as the founding director of Tech’s Algorithms and Randomness Center. He is a fellow of both the Association for Computing Machinery and the American Mathematical Society.
Describing his research as “studying the nature of computation, and its limits,” Vempala’s work ranges from theoretical to applied. Often entailing searching for efficient algorithms to solve fundamental mathematical and computational problems, his work also has applications such as trying to understand the problem-solving capabilities of the brain. “The best possible algorithms for basic problems — such as solving linear systems and linear programming — are still waiting to be discovered,” he says.
Along with continuing ACO’s longstanding record of research and academic excellence, Vempala is also keen to foster community and another ‘factor’ across the ACO community.
“I am looking forward to working with my colleagues in Computer Science, Mathematics, and ISyE, to building an atmosphere of scientific collegiality and open curiosity for faculty and students, and to having more social events with a high fun factor.”
In addition to research and leading ACO, Vempala is an active instructor who teaches Computability and Algorithms, Machine Learning Theory, Optimization and Sampling, and Computation and the Brain courses across campus.
“Teaching takes a lot of effort for me with an hour of lecture needing several hours of preparation, but it is consistently rewarding — each lecture is an opportunity to understand something better; each student is an opportunity to see something from a new angle.”

New Endowment Recognizes Teaching Assistants’ Dedication to Fellow Students
An alumna now working at Microsoft is the first to contribute to a newly established scholarship endowment.
The endowment recognizes the contributions that teaching assistants (TAs) make to the success of Georgia Tech’s School of Computing Instruction (SCI).
The $25,000 SCI Undergraduate Teaching Assistant Scholarship endowment was started by SCI Interim Associate Chair Mary Hudachek-Buswell. Once fully funded, the endowment is expected to award a financial scholarship of as much as $1,000 each year to one or two TAs enrolled in the College of Computing and supporting SCI faculty.
Although the word “endowment” might bring wealthy benefactors to mind, endowments such as this are really funding challenges.
“I’m not wealthy, but I want to honor the School’s TAs because they all work so hard. They sacrifice a lot to provide dedicated service to the College community, and they are extremely committed to making life better for their fellow students,” said Hudachek-Buswell.
To create the endowment, Hudachek-Buswell signed a contract with the Georgia Tech Foundation (GTF), which allowed an account to be established that can collect funds for the scholarship. The contract also obligates her to raising $25,000 for the scholarship within five years.
Whatever funds are raised will go into GTF’s general fund if the goal isn’t met. That said, two donors have already contributed to the endowment.
Adrianna Brown (CS 20), a software engineering with Microsoft in Seattle, was the first to donate. Not only did the former head undergraduate teaching assistant contribute, but she also worked to have Microsoft match her donation to the scholarship endowment. Brown has also challenged her fellow GT Computing alumni working with Microsoft to contribute as well.
Shortly after Brown’s donation, Chad Turner (CS 18) became the second alumni to step up for future TAs in the School of Computing Instruction. Turner worked as a TA for nearly two and a half years supporting Hudachek-Buswell’s classes. He’s now a software engineer with Facebook in Atlanta.
As undergraduates, Turner and Brown were among the 1,000 or so TAs that work to support SCI faculty each year by making copies, grading papers, answering student questions, and much more. Their service is vitally important because just 20 SCI faculty members and five part-time instructors teach all of the 1000- and 2000- courses that are required for all Tech undergraduates, as well as several upper-level courses.

Once the $25,000 goal is met, the scholarship recognizing TAs will become permanent. “Any funding beyond $25K will allow us to award additional scholarships to more TAs each year,” said Hudachek-Buswell.
More information and an online form to donate to the SCI Undergraduate Teaching Assistant Scholarship endowment are available.
New Faculty Member Brings a Fearless Approach to Ubiquitous Computing
Alexander Adams has made the transition from full-time musician to full-time assistant professor in ubiquitous computing. His interest in learning how to build the tools and instruments he used as a musician led him back to school and set him on a path toward building wearable sensing devices.
Adams arrives at Georgia Tech after receiving his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 2021. After serving as a research scientist for the Precision Behavioral Health Initiative at Cornell Tech, Adams brings to the School of Interactive Computing a passion for developing equitable ubiquitous computing and wearable devices within the healthcare industry.
Adams is in the process of setting up his Uncommon Sense Lab, which will center around the development of hardware-based ubiquitous technology. Adams said the lab will be a place where the students he works with won’t have to be afraid of throwing around big ideas.
“That’s really what’s exciting right now,” Adams said. “In the short time I’ve been here, the undergrad and masters students are really sharp and unafraid to try stuff.”
Adams will spend the spring semester completing the construction of his lab and recruiting students.
What interests you about working at Georgia Tech?
I was looking at interdisciplinary schools and schools that support interdisciplinary research. Georgia Tech is huge in ubiquitous computing. I’ve had lots of colleagues that worked here and students who worked with me who did their masters here. After interviewing, I just realized how much more Georgia Tech offered — not just in support for my type of work but people that complemented my work. I’m not a person who wants to do research and then stick it on a shelf and move on. I want to do research and hand it to someone who’s an expert and start the next phase of what needs to happen, whether that be human-centered design or the psychology behind it, and then be there to hopefully see it in the hands of people in live scenarios.
What will your research consist of?
I’m a hardware guy. I build systems for feedback or sensing. My research agenda is on equity and accessibility in healthcare and addressing health disparities from a device. How can we make cheap devices that can attach to people’s computers or phones that can give laboratory results at their home for more continuous care?
What inspired you to pursue this field of research?
It was a long road to get there. I was a professional musician before I was a scientist, and I went back to school to learn how to build the tools that I was using as a musician. My first project related to health was at Cornell, and some people heard that I had an audio background. They said they wanted to build a microphone to listen to the human body. That really hooked me — being able to build something and listening to different aspects of the human body and seeing how that connects to different things like chewing or swallowing or heart conditions. There are some really fulfilling solutions that come out of it.
What do you hope to accomplish in your research?
I’d like to see the stuff that comes out of this lab go out into the world and have an impact and to see startups come out of it and influence new standards in healthcare.
What are you looking forward to about teaching your students and how do you plan on working with them?
The plan is for me to teach ubiquitous computing. I love teaching. I get engaged by engaging students, so I make my courses interactive with a lot of back and forth. I’m looking for a different type of student and learning what they want and how they receive information. I’m looking forward to getting them involved in the research that’s going on, getting them engaged in some of these processes, and teaching them it’s okay to try and build something, it’s okay to break stuff. I want to teach them to fail fast and be exploratory. Don’t be restricted by what you read in one paper.
The following semester after next fall (2023), I’ll be getting my boutique course together, which will be more focused on health technology.
New Faculty Member Seeks to Expand Computer Science in Urban Communities
When Judith Uchidiuno considered the place where she wanted to work and the city she wanted to live in, Georgia Tech and Atlanta checked all the boxes.
Atlanta offered the perfect mix of urban culture with a nearby university that prides itself in diverse, interdisciplinary research, Uchidiuno said.
Uchidiuno begins her new role as an assistant professor at the School of Interactive Computing this semester. She looks to make an immediate impact in the Atlanta community by working with informal learning centers in urban areas of the city to expand accessibility to computer science education and develop new culturally responsive education technologies.
The Nigerian native earned her bachelor’s degree in computer science from Lincoln University just outside Philadelphia. While at Lincoln, she worked as a math and computer programming tutor for Pennsylvania’s Act 101 program. The state-funded program provides support services to academically and financially disadvantaged students to allow them to complete their postsecondary education.
From that point on, she understood the value of providing targeted interventions to low income and minority communities and has dedicated her research to the cause.
Uchidiuno finished her Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University in 2020 and served as a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie prior to being hired at Georgia Tech.
What interests you about working at Georgia Tech?
I do research that creates educational technologies and broadens CS education for students from low-income communities. Unfortunately, most communities of color in the United States contend with the devastating effects of poverty. It has been difficult to create technologies that are culturally engaging without accounting for the deficiencies that students in low-performing schools often experience. Atlanta offers a unique opportunity to work with several middle- and high-income communities of color, in addition to low-income communities. I am excited to see how that will transform my research.
What will your research consist of?
I conduct research in two broad areas. I design new education technologies in partnership with target users to ensure they are highly engaging and culturally responsive. I have done this with different African American and Hispanic communities in the United States, and in rural villages in East Africa. I also conduct research to broaden access to computer science instruction, especially in informal settings for people in low-income and low-resource areas. Many low performing schools don’t have access to computer science education, and we know that it’s important for many reasons including technological competency, and broadening participation in STEM careers.
What inspired you to pursue this field of research?
My mother worked for an oil company in Nigeria and she had a ThinkPad laptop. I’m sure she started at some point as a secretary, but I just knew that she typed faster than anybody that I knew in 1995, man or woman. She was strong in math and could do fancy PowerPoint animations. I assumed she was a computer scientist and wanted to be just like her. Combining that with my work in supplementing formal education for disadvantaged students, my path to doing CS education research with marginalized communities was set early in my life. I have learned through my teaching and research that targeted teaching and interventions can lead to amazing educational outcomes for struggling students. I feel privileged to do this work every day and enjoy becoming a part of the communities I work with.
I still exclusively use ThinkPad laptops for my work.
What do you hope to accomplish in your research?
I would like to build a community of computer science educators from nontraditional backgrounds, such as youth counselors with experience working in struggling communities, who will consistently provide CS instruction to K-8 students in afterschool programs in Atlanta. These educators will be trained to teach different CS topics and will be mentored by a network of expert computer science educators. They will also be paid a stipend for the time they spend receiving training and teaching students. This initiative will increase access to CS education in struggling communities and hopefully broaden participation in post-secondary CS education for the educators themselves.
What are you looking forward to about teaching your students and how do you plan on working with them?
I’m excited about how diverse students’ perspectives are, and how that will transform my teaching. I want to continue improving my teaching techniques in ways that my students continue to feel empowered, and truly value learning. I also look forward to keeping my materials current in ways that equip students with skills that are marketable in the workplace.
New Faculty Q&A: Christopher MacLellan
Christopher MacLellan explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can benefit human performance and learning in the classroom, team-oriented environments, and people’s daily lives.
MacLellan arrived this fall at the School of Interactive Computing as an assistant professor. In his new role, he will research and teach in the areas of cognitive systems, AI, human-computer interaction, and educational technology. This fall, he is teaching a knowledge-based AI course.
MacLellan worked for two years at Drexel University before coming to Georgia Tech. Before joining the faculty at Drexel, MacLellan spent three years working as a research scientist at Soar Technology Inc., where he developed novel AI and machine learning technologies to support users in making better decisions and learning more effectively.
MacLellan received his Ph.D. and master’s degree from the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. He also spent two years as a graduate student in computer science (CS) at Arizona State University and received his bachelor’s in CS from the University of Wyoming.
What interests you about working at Georgia Tech?
I think that Georgia Tech is at the center of a lot of the AI research that is going on in the country right now. Tech stands out as one of the few universities that has multiple National Science Foundation funded institutes that focus specifically on AI. There is also a strong human-centric component to the AI research that is being done here, which is key in my work. I learned a long time ago that if you want to make rapid progress in an area, you go to the center of where that kind of work is being done.
What will your research at Georgia Tech consist of?
My work focuses on trying to better understand how people teach and learn and then building computational systems that can teach and learn like they do. In a virtuous cycle, I aim to better understand the unique capabilities that humans exhibit, build AI systems that can exhibit these capabilities, and use these systems to improve the human condition and, in turn, to further improve our understanding of humans.
What inspired you to pursue this field of research?
I have always been fascinated by people’s ability to reason and learn. We can do amazing things. I cannot just take your mind apart to understand how it works. However, I can build computer models that exhibit similar behaviors as you, and we can run experiments with these models to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying your abilities. Unlocking uniquely human capabilities has the potential to revolutionize how people make use of AI technologies in their everyday lives.
What do you hope to accomplish in your research?
Ultimately, I aim to enable people who do not know anything about AI to be able to adapt these systems to their unique needs by teaching them new behaviors like how they would teach another human, through natural teaching interactions. This work should empower people to more effectively use AI technologies to improve their lives. I am particularly passionate about applying this concept to support teachers in creating and using AI-powered educational technologies to improve learning outcomes for students.
What are you looking forward to about teaching your students, and how do you plan on working with them?
This fall, I’ll be teaching knowledge-based AI. I am a strong believer that students should be taught about a broad range of AI paradigms and approaches. In this class, I am very excited to explore how knowledge, in addition to data, can be leveraged within AI systems. Additionally, I am very excited to explore how different AI algorithms and methods can be composed to create systems that can exhibit intelligent behavior. I look forward to charging a new generation of AI researchers with these ideas.
New Faculty Q&A with Danfei Xu
When it comes to robotics, Danfei Xu doesn’t consider himself a traditionalist.
His research focuses on data-driven approaches to develop better general-purpose robots that can work in everyday environments. While many robots are programmed through traditional analytical models that are based on equations, a data-driven approach allows robots to make decisions based on collected data.
Xu comes to the School of Interactive Computing after earning his Ph.D. in computer science from Stanford University in 2021. Xu will serve as an assistant professor. He is also a research scientist with NVIDIA AI Research. As an assistant professor at Georgia Tech, Xu will continue to build off his research and explore methods of learning and gaining intelligence autonomously within robotics and how humans can better teach robots.
In his first semester this fall, Xu will teach Deep Learning (CS 7643), which teaches complex, hierarchical feature representations from raw data and the fundamentals of principles, underlying mathematics, and implementation of details within.
Xu received his bachelor's degree in computer science from Columbia University and is originally from Shanghai, China.
What interests you about working at Georgia Tech?
The main reason is, if I want to spend a long time at a place, I want to be happy living here. I want to have a place where I can access a combination of big city and nature. There are not many places that has those things. I think Atlanta and Georgia Tech in general is a good choice. Georgia Tech is known for its robotics research, so that’s sort of a no-brainer.
What will your research consist of?
My research is in robots and specifically applying machine learning techniques to robotics problems. I think of that as a way for robots to learn by themselves and collect data by themselves. This is a slightly different approach to traditional robotics where they focus more on building a full analytical model of the world. We’re taking a more data-driven approach.
Within robotics, I mainly focus on manipulation problems. For example, we built an imitation-learning framework where we can allow humans to demonstrate tasks a few times or a few dozen times, depending on the difficulty of the task, and then collect these data. We then try to enable the robot to mimic the decision process, and then basically make that into a policy — a policy that controls the robot.
What inspired you to pursue this field of research?
I’ve always been interested in robotics, how to make things move like humans. I’m most interested in how the human brain works and how intelligence works in general. There are other ways to study this, but I thought it would be more fun to build something that can move around in the world and influence their environments through physical interaction.
What do you hope to accomplish in your research?
I want to continue to enhance my research with the support of students. The next milestone will be to build a comprehensive system that will allow us to sustain robotics research that allows us to show that a pure data-driven approach can enable robots to learn complex tasks. One of my goals is to learn for myself and disseminate what I know to my students on a different level.
What are you looking forward to about teaching your students and how do you plan on working with them?
The Deep Learning course teaches the basic principles of training large neural networks. I especially like the fact that the course gives the students hands-on experience with conducting basic research in AI and present the results to a wider audience. In terms of research, I enjoy mentoring and working alongside students to tackle impactful problems. My goal is to help them grow to become leaders in the community.
New Federal Innovations Program Looks to Tap Top-tier Talent at Tech
Students now have new entrepreneurial opportunities on campus.
Thanks to a Department of Defense (DoD) program that recently expanded to Georgia Tech, undergraduate and graduate students have a chance to serve the country by finding solutions to current national security threats.
The National Security Innovation Network (NSIN), established in 2016, officially joined the campus community in 2020. NSIN's mission is to create alliances between communities of innovators to establish a network of problem solvers. Its presence on campus builds on the Institute’s longstanding collaborative relationship with the DoD.
“The threats to our national security are constantly evolving. Our goal is to support our military and civilian defense personnel confronting these challenges by developing a network of problem-solvers that includes academic innovators and entrepreneurs,” said Patrick Reynolds, NSIN University Program Director at Georgia Tech.
“Because Georgia Tech is so highly ranked academically and widely known for its entrepreneurial ecosystem, we want to tap top-tier talent here and engage them in solving cybersecurity threats and other national defense problems in new ways.”
To connect with these students, NSIN will coordinate with existing entrepreneurial support programs like CREATE-X, Startup Exchange, and ATDC, as well as with other Georgia Tech resources for innovators.
[RELATED: Student Achievements Highlight Flourishing Entrepreneurial Culture]
“The entrepreneurial infrastructure in place at Georgia Tech is incredible. It’s a huge asset for NSIN, and we’re excited to partner with these programs,” Reynolds said.
“We’re pleased to formally welcome NSIN to Georgia Tech. The sophistication of today’s cybersecurity threats demands an interdisciplinary approach to taking on these challenges, so this is a unique opportunity for students across campus, regardless of their major, to gain real-world experience while helping the country,” said Charles Isbell, dean of Computing and John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
NSIN will offer its own programs, events, and resources to student entrepreneurs as well. These include fellowships, employment and recruiting events, training workshops, and more. They will also feature hackathons, the first of which is scheduled next month.
The upcoming NSIN Mad Hacks: Fury Code hackathon will challenge participants to develop new approaches to helping crewed and autonomous battlefield vehicles survive cyberattacks and other electronic warfare assaults. The winners will earn a contract worth between $15,000 and $30,000 to continue prototyping their solution.
The hackathon, which is open to all students, faculty, and recent graduates, kicks off Feb. 5 and runs through Feb. 26. Registration is open now.
Another NSIN opportunity for students is X-Force. This fellowship is likely familiar to Tech students due to the notable successes of the 2020 Fellows program. The NSIN X-Force program connects undergraduate and graduate students with operational military commands. Students accepted to the program will work with a sponsoring command to address specific, real-world security issues. The extended deadline to register for X-Force is Feb. 1.
“X-Force is a tremendous opportunity for Georgia Tech students to put their skills and abilities to use serving the country while working directly with military and national security experts. This summer opportunity offers both full-time paid and part-time unpaid fellowship positions,” said Reynolds.
NSIN will also be in the classroom beginning in the Fall. Hacking for Defense (H4D) is a semester-long for-credit course. In this class, Georgia Tech subject matter experts and DoD end users work with student teams to develop minimum viable products (MVP) for existing security problems. While usually far from being completely fleshed out, successful MVPs can serve as early prototypes earmarked for further development.
“Hacking for Defense courses leverage entrepreneurial methods like the five Lean Startup principles. Along with developing an MVP, teams conduct a hundred or more stakeholder interviews as part of creating their MVP solutions to national security challenges,” said Reynolds.
Georgia Tech is part of the NSIN Southeast Region, one of 11 commercial innovation hubs throughout the country. NSIN customers and strategic partners in this region include Special Operations Command, Central Command, Southern Command, Army Special Operations Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division, and the Air Force Special Operations Command. NSIN is headquartered in Arlington, VA.
New Framework Mimics High-Functioning Human Teams, Decreases Risks from Unreliable Bots
A Georgia Institute of Technology research group in the School of Interactive Computing has developed a robotics system that exceeds existing standards for collaborative bots that work independently to achieve a shared goal.
The system intelligently increases the information shared among the bots and allows for improved cooperation. The aim is to model high-functioning human teams. It also creates resiliency against bad or unreliable team bots that may hinder the overall programmed goal.
“Intuitively, the idea behind our new framework — InfoPG — is that a robot agent goes back-and-forth on what it thinks it should do with their teammates, and then the teammates will update on what they think is best to do,” said Esmaeil Seraj, Ph.D. student in the CORE Robotics Lab and researcher on the project. “They do this until the decision is deeply rationalized and reasoned about.”
The work focuses on artificial agents on a decentralized team — in simulations or the real world — working in concert toward a specific task. Applications could include surgery, search and rescue, and disaster response, among others.
InfoPG facilitates communication between the artificial agents on an iterative basis and allows for actions and decisions that mimic human teams working at optimal levels.
“This research is in fact inspired by how high-performing human teams act,” said Seraj.
“Humans normally use k-level thinking — such as, ‘what I think you will do, what I think you think I will do, and so on’ — to rationalize their actions in a team,” he said. “The basic thought is that the more you know about your teammate's strategy, the easier it is for you to take the best action possible.”
Using this approach, the researchers designed InfoPG to make one bot’s decisions conditional on its teammates. They ran simulations using simple games like Pong, and complex games like StarCraft II.
In the latter — where the goal is for one team of agents to defeat another — the InfoPG architecture showed very advanced strategies. Seraj said agents in one case learned to form a triangle formation, sacrificing the front agent while the two other agents eliminated the enemy. Without InfoPG in play, an agent abandoned its team to save itself.
The new method also limits the disruption a bad bot on the team might cause.
“Coordinating actions with such a fraudulent agent in a collaborative multi-agent setting can be detrimental,” said Matthew Gombolay, assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing and director of the CORE Robotics Lab. “We need to ensure the integrity of robot teams in real-world applications where bots might be tasked to save lives or help people and organizations extend their capabilities.”
Results of the work show InfoPG’s performance exceeds various baselines in learning cooperative policies for multi-agent reinforcement learning. The researchers plan to move the system from simulation into real robots, such as controlling a swarm of drones to help surveil and fight wildfires.
The research is published in the 2022 Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations. The paper, Iterated Reasoning with Mutual Information in Cooperative and Byzantine Decentralized Teaming is co-authored by computer science major Sachin G. Konan, Seraj, and Gombolay.
This work was sponsored by the Office of Naval Research under grant N00014-19-1-2076 and the Naval Research Lab (NRL) under the grant N00173-20-1-G009. The researchers’ views and statements are based on their findings and do not necessarily reflect those of the funding agencies.
New Graduate Fellowship Encourages Research Collaborations
The School of Computer Science (SCS) has launched a new graduate fellowship. The Incubator Graduate Fellowship Program is designed to foster research collaborations between faculty who have not worked together before by dedicating funding to innovative pairings.
Twenty students submitted applications for the fellowship and four were selected by a committee of SCS faculty members including Professors Dana Randall and Ellen Zegura, Associate Professor Ada Gavrilovska, Assistant Professor Qirun Zhang, and Senior Research Scientist Greg Eisenhauer.
The fellowship recipients, along with their primary advisors and faculty collaborators, are:
- Alind Khare (Assistant Professor Alexey Tumanov, with Associate Professor Tushar Krishna)
- Xinya Liu (Professor Alessandro Orso, with Assistant Professor Joy Arulraj)
- Marina Vemmou (Assistant Professor Alexandros Daglis, with Professor Moin Qureshi)
- Renzhi Wu (Assistant Professor Xu Chu, with Assistant Professor Joy Arulraj)
“I think the SCS Incubator Fellowship is a great initiative to kickstart collaborations,” said Daglis, who will be revisiting research on memory hierarchy design policies for modern architectures with intense networking activity. “It is exciting to embark on this joint SCS-backed research effort together, combining our expertise in memory systems and networked architectures.”
Winners will have the 2021-22 academic year to seed their collaborative research and present their work at the end of the academic year.
“I am delighted by the outcome of this first round of the new SCS Incubator Graduate Fellowship Program,” said SCS Chair Vivek Sarkar. “It’s exciting to see so many junior faculty members involved, and I look forward to seeing the fruits of these new collaborations.”
New Grant Will Help to Develop Immersive Ocean Learning for Visually-Impaired Students
Visually-impaired students will soon have the opportunity to study oceanography in more inclusive learning environments thanks to a new grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). Researchers at Georgia Tech, along with other collaborators, were awarded $300,000 over two years to develop immersive informal learning exhibits about ocean data using sound.
Titled Accessible Oceans: Exploring Ocean Data Through Sound, the project will use auditory displays in museums, science centers, and aquariums.
“Most data presentations in these spaces use visual display techniques like graphs, charts, or visualizations,” said Carrie Bruce, a senior research scientist in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing and one of the co-principle investigators on the project. “These media can provide inequitable access for learners with vision impairments or other print-related disabilities.”
In these displays, music or sound effects may often be used, but are inadequate for conveying key quantitative information. This project will use sonification to convey key data about ocean phenomena from charts and graphs for all learners with and without disabilities. It will include a context-setting audio introduction that will help ensure all users start with the same basic information about the subject. They will leverage existing educational ocean datasets from the NSF-funded Ocean Observatories Initiative to create the displays.
Researchers on the project will also engage a collection of ocean science experts, visually-impaired students and adults, as well as teachers, and design-oriented undergraduate and graduate students.
The study will include 425 participants, but will reach many more through the development of educational materials and public reporting. Researchers will partner with the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Ocean Discovery Center, the Georgia Aquarium, the Eugene Science Center, the Atlanta Center for the Visually Impaired, and the Perkins School for the Blind.
Bruce said the project will generate new publicly accessible resources.
“This will advance studies of inclusive approaches on motivating learners with and without disabilities to learn more about and consider careers in STEM,” Bruce said.
New Hall of Fame Inductees ‘Cast Long Shadows’ on Computing
UPDATED May 10, 2019: The Georgia Tech College of Computing recently honored its 2019 Hall of Fame inductees.

New Hardware Brings Students Closer to Exascale Computing
Much like household computers, current supercomputers become obsolete with advancements in technology. This poses a challenge for researchers when it is critical to have the latest hardware on hand to continue their studies.
School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Assistant Professor Spencer Bryngelson recently received an AMD MI210 GPU accelerator to use in his computational physics lab. In doing so, the research group takes a step closer to gaining access to Frontier, the world’s first exascale supercomputer.
“I don’t get excited about too many things, but this is nice. This is the next generation of supercomputing that will be around for some years,” Bryngelson said. “I’m glad to be part of it and AMD has been extremely generous and helpful in all the ways they possibly can be.”
Released in March, Georgia Tech is one of the first research institutes in the world to receive AMD’s newest hardware. The accelerator can conduct 45 trillion-plus HPC calculations in a second, which is more than twice as fast as comparable competitors, according to AMD.
The MI210 is part of AMD’s MI200 series, which includes the MI250X GPU. Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Frontier supercomputer, which claimed the world’s fastest computer title in May, uses AMD MI250X GPUs. The MI210 is about half as powerful as the MI250X but uses the same architecture.
In the coming years, Bryngelson wants to access Frontier and use the supercomputer toward his research. To do so, he must configure his existing software and algorithms to operate on AMD hardware, which the MI210 enables him to do.
“We are going to prepare our applications to be able to use multiple accelerators from different manufacturers,” Bryngelson said. “This is a two-way street. AMD procures the hardware for me to prepare, and I report my results back to them.”
Bryngelson explained that he coordinated directly with AMD to receive the MI210 by advocating for his research in competition with other stakeholders. With the MI210 in hand, he can provide feedback to AMD to help them update current products and develop new technology.
Bryngelson manages the Computational Physics Group, which develops computational models and numerical methods in the study of fluid dynamics. Their research has applications in the medical, defense, and energy fields.
The addition of the MI210 accelerator is the latest hardware acquisition Bryngelson has facilitated since arriving to Tech in August 2021. In April, Bryngelson received two NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs through the company’s Academic Hardware Grant Program.
With the addition of the AMD MI210, Bryngelson and the School of CSE are leading the charge in testing the next generation of supercomputers while providing students the latest and greatest technology available toward their research.
“It’s been great, everyone is very excited,” Bryngelson said. “My students that work on along these HPC lines of research are quite excited to have hands-on access to the workhorses of the world’s largest computers. We’re entering a small paradigm shift in supercomputing.”
New Hybrid Machine Learning Framework Extends Range of Accurate Epidemic Forecasting
Community leaders and public health officials may soon have more time to plan for Covid and flu outbreaks thanks to a new machine learning (ML) framework that is improving the accuracy of long-range epidemic forecasting.
That is exactly what researchers at Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) have developed through EINNs, Epidemiologically-Informed Neural Networks.
Along with proving its ability to improve accuracy in long-term epidemic forecasting, EINNs has implications in artificial intelligence (AI) by leading a path toward optimization for current models based on neural networks and differential equations to follow.
“To generate trustworthy epidemic forecasts, more than just data may be required,” said Alexander Rodríguez, a CSE Ph.D. student and EINNs researcher. “In our paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing a methodology to enable better integration of epidemiological knowledge and deep neural networks. This integration can help neural networks predict farther into the future.”
Joining Rodríguez on the EINNs team from the School of CSE are Ph.D. student Jiaming Cui and Associate Professor B. Aditya Prakash. The trio partnered with Virginia Tech Professor Naren Ramakrishnan and Bijaya Adhikari, an assistant professor at the University of Iowa, to develop EINNs.
In their study, all models, including EINNs, made eight-week forecasts for Covid-19 and flu, in two time periods. The team’s testing period for Covid-19 forecasting spanned Sept. 2020 to March 2021, which encompassed the entire Delta variant wave. For flu, the period lasted from Dec. 2017 to May 2018.
When testing EINNs in forecasting Covid-19 and flu, the framework resulted in improved accuracy of up to 55% of recurrent neural network models, while also increasing correlation with epidemic trends. EINNs also demonstrated 77% less error in comparison to traditional mechanistic epidemiological models based on ordinary differential equations.
These results show promise in forecasting multiple diseases at the same time from a longer perspective. This could prevent future hardships, like the 2022 “tripledemic” of COVID-19, flu, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
As a result of the success of the framework’s design, and its potential for improving epidemic forecasting, the research team presented EINNs at the 37th Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2023 conference in Washington, D.C. Here, the conference committee assigned EINNs to the AI for Social Impact track.
“Predicting and preventing epidemics are major challenges for the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with far-reaching effects on health, economy, and social well-being,” Rodríguez said. “Forecasting with EINNs allows us to see further into the future, which it critical to planning and decision-making in public health.”
Part of the beauty of EINNs is its incorporation of the best aspects from neural networks and mechanistic models, an idea borrowed from physics-informed neural networks. The team mentions in their study that the goal was not to compete with the models, but rather to develop a method for consistently good performance in accuracy and correlation.
Current neural network models are good at short-term forecasting, typically one to four weeks, but do not have any knowledge on epidemic dynamics. As a result, they often lose accuracy in long-term forecasting.
Mechanistic models, on the other hand, contain this knowledge, making them a welcomed addition to deep neural networks for long-term epidemic forecasting. At the same time, mechanistic models have difficulty ingesting some datasets, like social media data. EINNs enables such models to incorporate these datasets better through neural networks.
In total, the research team made 5,696 predictions per tested model, including EINNs. This required training each model more than 700 times. Though computationally expensive, this developed the AI that ultimately led the team’s success.
To accomplish this, the team tested models on four Intel Xeon E7-4850 CPUs, boosted by four NVDIA Tesla V100 DGXS 32GB GPUs. With code written in PyTorch, the GPUs completed training of each predictive task in about 30 minutes.
“Current ML modes don’t utilize domain knowledge embedded in epidemiological models and we wanted to bridge that gap,” Rodríguez said. “To accomplish this, we took inspiration from recent work in scientific AI and developed new techniques. We incorporate this mechanistic knowledge by carefully matching so-called gradients of epidemic variable through transfer learning.”
New Podcast and Video Series Seeks to Highlight AI Researchers Stories Over Stats
With accolades showered upon them, seemingly perfect educational pedigrees, and conversations focused mostly on their groundbreaking work, it’s hard to remember that artificial intelligence (AI) researchers are real people.
They’re people who take ballet classes as an adult, who suffer from anxiety, and love art. They’re also people who feel giddy over fresh flowers, have a difficult time staying organized, and roll out of bed just in time for their first meeting.
New Privacy Research Hopes to Serve as Roadmap to Reform
When security and privacy is violated by data gathering companies, calls for reform from victims often result in little to no change due to a lack of agreed demands and a misalignment between experts and the public.
To help solve this problem, Yuxi Wu, a Ph.D. student at the Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing (School of IC) explored designing a system that guides people affected by institutional privacy violations toward making unified demands for redress. Wu will present the research at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2022) on May 2.
The paper investigates issues of representation and stewardship that appear when a collective wants change. Wu and her co-authors note that in the cases reviewed by their team, advocacy efforts failed due to a lack of debate and agreed solutions in internet petitions. Unclear goals and a lack of technical knowledge creates a rift between those affected by data breaches and the experts who can create solutions.
“Tons of people go on the internet to complain about these breaches and maybe a few petitions go truly viral,” Wu said. “But the original authors weren’t thinking of thousands of people when they wrote them. There is no good way to have a true discussion and present a united front as a collective.”
For example, in the wake of the Equifax breach in 2017, several petitions were started online. One of the biggest has close to 250,000 signatures with more being added, but it hasn’t been resolved.
The petition in this case states once it has reached 300,000 signatures it will be sent to several federal organizations including a federal judge who ruled on the case in the summer of June 2021. It is also worth noting the creator of the Change.org petition has not made an update in three years.
To explore how to improve on the dead ends of petitions, Wu and her co-authors developed their own version of a find-fix-verify process to corral people toward consensus. They recruited 400 online participants to identify concerns in response to an institutional privacy violation, come up with demands from these concerns, and vote on the most pressing demands. The participants eventually voted for 12 demands.
“People are really angry with big institutions, and they want to talk about them,” said Wu. “It is really difficult to translate these broad concerns and demands into specific actionable priorities.”
To help with mapping these demands onto the real world, the researchers then consulted a panel of eight security and privacy experts.
“The experts did share some agreements with the crowd: they recognized the harms that users faced was painful and hard to deal with,” said Wu. “However, they disagreed with the actions being demanded of institutions.”
A major disconnect between the two groups came from experts deeming the demands as unrealistic. However, Wu points out that experts’ deep knowledge of and entrenchment in the very institutions that collectives are fighting against might also make them dismissive of collectives. As a result, she hopes that future design work can examine how to address this tension, and how experts might in turn be assessed by collectives.
“A Reasonable Thing to Ask For”: Towards a Unified Voice in Privacy Collective Action was written by Wu along with her academic advisors Keith Edwards and Sauvik Das.
New Program Offers Students Opportunities to Join New Computer Science Honor Society Chapters
Beginning in Fall 2021, students in as many as 20 high schools in Georgia could have new Computer Science Honor Society (CSHS) chapters thanks to the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing (Constellations) and Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA.)
“We’re thrilled to welcome these new Georgia schools to the CS Honor Society community, which encourage students’ enthusiasm for computer science, honors their academic achievements, and promotes service toward their greater community with a focus on equity,” said Jake Baskin, executive director of CSTA. “I can’t wait to see the amazing impact these new chapters will have on their schools and districts.”
Constellations will assist schools by providing first-year funding for new chapters starting in the 2021-22 academic year. The funds will be directed toward initial fees to start a CSHS chapter for up to 20 students in each school for a maximum of $300 per school.
Schools must meet several criteria to be eligible for assistance, including a commitment to recruiting at least 50 percent female students into a new CSHS chapter. Eligible schools must also serve a majority of underrepresented students and/or serve a majority of students qualifying for free and reduced lunch.
Honor society members will be required to complete 10 service hours, with five being dedicated to service projects related to computer science. Members will also select one or more computer science-related projects each academic year that fulfill a need within their school or community.
The introduction of CSHS is a new step in Constellations’ mission to ensure that all students – especially students of color, women, and others underserved in K-12 and post-secondary institutions – have access to quality computer science education. Since 2017, Constellations has partnered with Georgia high schools to introduce advanced placement computer science courses in addition to professional development opportunities for educators.
“I believe that helping schools to start CSHS chapters will help educators and students better understand the importance of computing knowledge and its application to the real world. Through the service commitment, students are using computer science to help solve community issues they care about in addition to gaining leadership skills and having fun with computing in an equitable environment,” said Lien Diaz, director of educational innovation and leadership at Constellations.
Applications for assistance close April 23. Selected schools will be notified mid-May. For more information on selection criteria and CSHS, visit http://constellations.gatech.edu/computer-science-honor-society
New Research Award May Lead to Better Tools for Intelligence Community
The U.S. intelligence community may soon have a faster and more efficient way of analyzing and storing complex data.
Georgia Tech researchers have been awarded $15.8 million by the Advanced Graphic Intelligence Logical Computing Environment (AGILE) program to develop new computer system designs that can execute large-scale data-analytic applications and solve other classes of large irregular problems more than a hundred times more efficiently than current designs.
The project is named Flow-Optimized Reconfigurable Zones of Acceleration (FORZA). School of Computer Science (SCS) Chair and Stephen Fleming Chair for Telecommunications, Vivek Sarkar, is the principal investigator for this project.
“This is a unique opportunity to take a clean sheet co-design approach to address the long-standing challenges and inefficiencies faced when executing irregular data-analytic applications, such as graph algorithms, on current systems,” said Sarkar. “Pushing the boundaries of algorithms and hardware are areas of strength for Georgia Tech, and we’re delighted to work with our partners at Cornelis, Lucata, UCSC, and ND on this exciting project.”
The AGILE program is a partnership between the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) and the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command’s Army Research Laboratory. The AGILE program helps the intelligence community process and store increasingly complex and large amounts of data by laying the foundations for novel computer architectures that will perform these operations far more efficiently than current systems.
The co-investigators include SCS Professor Tom Conte, SCS Assistant Professor Alex Daglis, SCS Professor and Co-Director of the Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH) Hyesoon Kim, CSE Professor and CRNCH Co-Director Rich Vuduc, and SCS Senior Research Scientist Jeff Young. The award will also support research collaborators at Cornelis Networks, Lucata Corporation, the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC), and the University of Notre Dame (ND).
"The multidisciplinary scope of the research is impressive. Our students will see this research as every computer science systems and algorithms class they ever took coming together in a single project. FORZA is the ultimate final exam, albeit more fun," said Vuduc.
Kim said the goal of the project also fits with CRNCH’s mission to find new paths forward in the post-Moore’s Law era, where the number of transistors on a chip cannot be expected to double every 1.5 to 2 years, as it has for decades.
“The program allows us to re-consider how to design a processor from scratch to handle irregular large-scale data.” said Kim.
New Research Explores Indoor Navigation
A new technology tests the use of ultra-wide band (UWB) radio technology for indoor navigation, providing a simple way to navigate indoor spaces.
Georgia Tech School of Computer Science Assistant Professor Ashutosh Dhekne and student Haige Chen presented their paper, PnPLoc: UWB Based Plug & Play Indoor Localization, at IPIN (Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation) 2022 in September 2022, where it won the best paper award.
The paper focuses on the use of UWB to map and help people navigate indoor settings. Chen and Dhekne developed a system and prototype, PnPLoc, that they tested inside various indoor spaces.
PnPLoc includes two key elements: UWB “anchor” devices placed throughout a building and a “passive wireless listener” that connects to a user’s cellphone. The two devices communicate wirelessly with each other, allowing the user to know their location inside the building.
Dhekne said the UWB technology functions similarly to GPS, but unlike GPS, which does not work well indoors due to walls and other obstacles blocking the signal, UWB signals are capable of better indoor coverage.
“If you’re looking for a specific room in a large building on campus, currently GPS won’t help you,” Dhekne said. “Having a system like this in a building allows you to navigate from the building’s entrance to your indoor destination.”
Like GPS, Dhekne said PnPLoc is also inherently privacy preserving. Other benefits of the system are that it is highly scalable and easy to install for building managers and easy to use for the end users. To accomplish this, the team made the “anchor” devices able to plug in to a wall socket anywhere, and a guidance system for building managers to decide the next anchor location for good coverage.
“This paper solves two important challenges in indoor localization that have been around for a long time: having both a privacy preserving and scalable solution,” Dhekne said.
Along with helping people navigate indoor spaces, both researchers say that the technology has several potential applications, such as facility management, meetups, location-based reminders, etc. While the underlying technology is privacy preserving, and appropriate permissions would be needed, an application using the technology could share a user’s location within a structure to building managers. This would allow building managers to use the data to improve user experience and efficiency in the indoor space. It could also help locate people within a building during an emergency.
“One of the motivations of this paper was to make the leap from indoor localization as a research field to making it a tool commonly used by everyone,” Chen said. “I think that’s one of our main achievements here.”
The fundamental technology developed in this project is already becoming the foundation for several related projects under Dhekne’s mentorship, including a demo and a poster presented at UbiComp 2022, a demo at MobiSys 2022, and an upcoming demo at HotMobile 2023.
This work is supported by Dhekne’s NSF CAREER award, which he earned in 2022, and by Cisco.
New Research Explores Using Generative AI Technology for Materials Discovery
With the explosive rise of popular artificial intelligence applications like ChatGPT and DALL-E, consumers are becoming more and more familiar with the world of generative models. While these fun, novel tools are helpful in our everyday lives, Georgia Tech researchers are using the same technology to make new scientific discoveries and solve complex engineering challenges.
One example of this is Victor Fung, an assistant professor with Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE). Fung recently led a research team that developed a new, first-of-its-kind algorithm that can reconstruct atomic structure in generative models.
A significant application Fung focuses this research toward is in the field of materials science and engineering. The algorithm could be key in developing further AI tools and new materials to the benefit of individual researchers and entire communities alike.
“Structural representations are a well-known concept people have used in other machine learning applications for chemistry and materials, like training models to predict energies and forces,” Fung said. “But this is really the first time that anyone has used this in generative models.”
Structure is a key property in a material design. For example, structure plays a role in determining superconductivity within electronics, biological viability in drugs, and catalyzation of certain chemical reactions.
Fung explained that using generative models to study atomic structure, and to design new materials, could be vital in climate remediation. This may include developing greener catalysts for use in fuel cells, designing better material for carbon capture, and discovering new light-absorbent molecules for application in solar panels.
The algorithm can help engineers create new materials with targeted properties by building models atom-by-atom, a concept called inverse design. The algorithm is a progressive step forward in allowing computer models to create new materials tailor-made with specific functions and characteristics in mind by designers.
Specifically, the algorithm allows materials scientists to know the exact structure of materials that exhibit a desired property, potentially making proposed material designs a reality.
“If we know the structure of material, we can be sure of what properties it has, and we will have a clear goal to try to synthesize it and develop applications,” Fung said. “We basically have the key to defining the material in the chemical space.”
Fung’s paper is the first in a forthcoming series of studies to develop new generative models for atomic structure. He and his co-researchers think the series could result in new algorithms and models that yield commercial benefits, as well as solve large, scientific problems.
As part of this campaign to share his research, Fung is set to discuss the findings March 31 at 2023 Symposium on Materials Innovations, hosted by Georgia Tech’s Institute for Materials (IMat).
School of CSE Ph.D. student Shuyi Jia worked with Fung to develop the algorithm and is a co-author on the paper. The pair partnered with Oak Ridge National Laboratory scientists Jiaxin Zhang, Junqi Yin, and Panchapakesan Ganesh through the study.
Along with AI tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E, generative models are popularly used today in images, text, audio, and other types of information. They are not as common in overcoming scientific challenges due to their data-intensive nature, an obstacle that Fung’s algorithm helps overcome.
In technical terms, the algorithm makes it possible for generative models to work with non-invertible structural representations, such as atom-centered symmetry functions.
Now that the group has learned how to use models to generate structure, they want to extend this to broader problems in materials design and discovery. This includes being able to generate structures with different chemical compositions as well.
Here, their algorithm becomes a tested, verified method using generative models to understand and overcome complex engineering problems.
“People who are interested in solving these kinds of problems in materials discovery, whether for specific applications, specific types of materials, or specific properties, can potentially use this approach, or at least take inspiration from it,” Fung said.
New Research Gives Users Another Reason to Hate Unwanted Ads
New research released this week reveals the process used by third party advertisers to target online users can be viewed or manipulated by online adversaries using only their target's email address.
A four-person team of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), and New York University (NYU) presented their findings Wednesday at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), a premier security venue.
Today, much of the advertising that appears online is specifically tailored to individuals based on their browsing history, location, and a variety of other factors that have been collected by third party advertising networks.
This data is collected by tracking cookies, which are sent out by third party ad networks and correlated with unique identifiers like email addresses. These cookies allow advertisers to create extensive profiles of internet users, however as the researchers found, this system can be influenced by bad actors.
Once an attacker knows a user’s email address, they can tap into the information being collected by any third-party advertiser observing a specific user’s targeted ad stream. This could allow bad actors insight into to an individual’s detailed browsing history, such as online retailers and travel websites.
“Third party ad networks have no direct relationship with users. Thus, if they want to track user activity across devices, they must rely on identity information, such as email addresses, given to them from other various websites,” said Paul Pearce, assistant professor in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP) at Georgia Tech. “Our work shows the way that information is passed to the ad networks is both insecure and hard to verify. If an attacker knows a victim’s email address, they can lie to the ad network pretending to be a user, leading to very real privacy problems.”
The researchers describe this susceptibility as advertising identity entanglement and it happens when attackers confuse ad networks into correlating the attacker’s tracking cookies with a targeted person’s email address, looping them into the data being gathered by third parties. As Pearce and his colleagues state in their paper, adversaries can also leverage the process to send ads of any kind to their targets.
"When I use the Internet on my own private device, like a phone or a laptop, I don't expect that anyone who knows my personal email could manipulate what I see,” said Chris Kanich, associate professor at UIC. “This attack is particularly disturbing, and I am relieved that I use ad and tracking blockers in my web browsers."
To test the scale of this problem, researchers created an artificial users and profile for their experiment, at no time was a real person targeted. By knowing only, the experimental user’s email address, the team was able to Identify specific items and websites the victim interacted with.
Along with shopping habits, the test also showed retargeted advertisements can contain sensitive location information. For example, if a victim interacted with some hotel and travel websites, the attacker could then receive retargeted ads for the specific hotel the victim viewed.
“An ad network potentially leaking travel plans to anyone with a target’s email address is a significant privacy threat and potentially dangerous to people being stalked,” said Damon McCoy, associate professor at NYU.
The researchers indicate that combatting this problem without the support of ad networks is challenging, but ad blockers provide a reasonable initial option to limit exposing a user’s private data. Mitigation of this threat shouldn’t just fall on the users, however. The team also suggests that if third party ad networks encrypted the process of exchanging identity information and ensured the data was verified and correct it would help mitigate the threat.
The research was presented at ACM CCS’22. The paper, Cart-ology: Intercepting Targeted Advertising via Ad Network Identity Entanglement, is co-authored by SCP Ph.D. student ChangSeok Oh, Kanich, McCoy, and Pearce. In accordance with ethical research guidelines, the threat was disclosed to Criteo, one of the largest third-party ad networks on the market, as well as Yahoo.
New School Builds on Commitment to Advancing Cybersecurity and Privacy Education
Georgia Tech, which has been named No. 1 in undergraduate cybersecurity education by U.S. News and World Report, is building upon its success by launching a new School of Cybersecurity and Privacy. The new school is the first of its kind among top research universities.
The new school will build on Georgia Tech’s considerable investments in cybersecurity and privacy education and research. The Institute already has three cybersecurity degree programs. The school will weave them together with other important interdisciplinary programs.
“The new School of Cybersecurity and Privacy is a reflection of Georgia Tech’s strengths and commitment to serving the needs of our society and our state,” said Georgia Tech President Ángel Cabrera.
“Georgia Tech’s new School of Cybersecurity and Privacy will focus on applied research collaborations with the fast-growing cybersecurity industry in Georgia and meeting a critical workforce need,” Cabrera said. “It will bring together Georgia Tech’s expertise across disciplines to advance technology and find new solutions to protect our personal privacy and support our national security.”
There are more than 500 cybersecurity researchers spread across Georgia Tech who bring in more than $180 million in research awards annually. Georgia Tech’s faculty are ranked #2 in the world in publications in top security conferences.
“The School of Cybersecurity and Privacy at Georgia Tech is the first school of its kind at a top university, drawing together faculty and researchers across various disciplines from practically all six colleges at Georgia Tech and the Georgia Tech Research Institute,” said Rafael L. Bras, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs at Georgia Tech. “Our excellence in the field is well established but the School will create the necessary synergy to multiply our impact and make our national security, and the personal security of individuals, safer from the threat of cyberattacks.”
The new school will be inter college and interdisciplinary because cybersecurity and privacy problems typically play out across multiple dimensions.
“Cybersecurity includes not only technology but the law, business processes, and cultural considerations,” said Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay, Jr. chair of the College of Computing. “The School of Cybersecurity and Privacy will bring together thought leaders from all of those areas to push the envelope of technical innovation and produce the workforce of the future."
To that end, the school will bring in not only computer scientists and engineers, but business experts and behaviorists.
“Solving tomorrow’s toughest cybersecurity problems will require not only a thorough understanding of the technologies and threats involved. It also will require deep expertise in behavioral and policy considerations that must increasingly inform the development and use of new cybersecurity approaches and technologies,” said Kaye Husbands Fealing, dean of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts.
“By drawing on Georgia Tech’s globally respected expertise in the technology and policy arenas, the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy will extend our leadership in this area with exactly the kind of innovative, interdisciplinary, human-centered thinking and research we need to advance socially responsible and technically practical solutions to these critical issues.”
The solutions and the workforce produced by the new School will not only benefit business, but also protect every aspect of our online lives and our national infrastructure.
“Cybersecurity is not just a personal issue — our credit cards or identities quickly come to mind — but it has an even larger impact on national security, financial markets, even power grids,” Steve McLaughlin, dean of Georgia Tech’s College of Engineering said. “That is why the new School of Cybersecurity and Privacy is so important at this time. Cybersecurity, privacy, and related policies dominate the priorities of many organizations, and the need for advanced research and talent is outpacing supply. Georgia Tech is already a leader in this area the new School will take us to even greater heights and impact.”
The creation of the school has been welcomed by industry leaders in cybersecurity and privacy, both in Atlanta and nationwide. Atlanta in particular is a center of financial technology, an area that goes hand-in-hand with cybersecurity.
"Financial technology companies leverage technology and data to fuel innovation, which makes cybersecurity and privacy vital to their success”, said Ryan Graciano (B.S. Computer Science ’04), co-founder and chief technology officer of Credit Karma. “This means not only staying on the cutting-edge technologically, but also building systems that work with multiple sets of privacy regulations in different jurisdictions. The School of Cybersecurity will be an essential resource for fintech companies in Atlanta and worldwide."
The new school will strengthen Atlanta’s tech economy, said Alan Taetle, general partner at the venture-capital firm Noro-Moseley Partners.
“The creation of a new School of Cybersecurity and Privacy will help the Atlanta tech ecosystem build on two of its greatest strengths: internet security and payment processing,” Taetle said. “Georgia Tech is a world-class university that creates world-class technology, and I expect the new school to both produce new companies and also provide vital support to existing ones both locally and nationally.”
Of course, financial companies are not the only ones to benefit from new cybersecurity and privacy technologies.
“Consumer demands for digital service are transforming business, forcing new innovations in cloud infrastructure and other areas for businesses to compete or remain relevant. Every one of these innovations must be accompanied by new cybersecurity technologies and policies in order to keep both corporations and consumers safe,“ said Tony Spinelli, chief information officer for Urban One, Inc. and former chief information officer for Capital One. “The School of Cybersecurity and Privacy, in other words, is addressing a vast and growing demand from all sectors of the modern digital economy.”
The School of Cybersecurity and Privacy will be led by interim chair Rich DeMillo (Ph.D. ’72), the Charlotte B. and Warren C. Chair of Computer Science and Professor of Management. DeMillo has previously served as the founder and executive director of Georgia Tech’s Center for 21st Century Universities, and as the dean of the College of Computing. He is the author of more than 100 articles, books, and patents, and is a fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Science and the Association of Computing Machinery. Prior to arriving at the Institute, DeMillo served as Hewlett-Packard’s first chief technology officer.
“Its roots are in computer science and engineering, mathematics, public policy, and national security, but the last twenty years has seen the birth of cybersecurity as a profession in its own right,” DeMillo said. “I am pleased that the Institute recognized this shift by launching an academic unit that will be home to a new generation of scholars. Building that culture will be challenging, but we will be judged by the success of our people and our ability to meet the growing demand for Georgia Tech-caliber experts with unique skills.”
The new school will launch a nationwide search this fall for multiple faculty members and for its founding chair. For more information about the school, please visit its website.
New School Highlights Importance of Computing Instruction at Georgia Tech
The College of Computing is proud to announce the launch of the School of Computing Instruction (SCI) at Georgia Tech.
The new school focuses on undergraduate computing education and innovative scholarship into scalable techniques for teaching computing to all levels.
“It's time for the College's Division of Computing Instruction to become a school,” said Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay, Jr. chair of the College of Computing.
“Not just because they do a tremendous amount of work for the College and the Institute—although they do—but because they constantly produce new scholarship and techniques that expand everyone’s ability to both teach and learn computing. This new school is both a recognition and a celebration of their ongoing contributions to what makes Georgia Tech great.”
The College has long had a Division of Computing Instruction housing its teaching-track faculty, which now includes 15 full-time and five part-time lecturers. As a school, the Computing Instruction faculty will continue to teach all 1000- and 2000- courses, as well as some upper division courses.
In all, SCI faculty teach a third of the College’s undergraduate course sections and half of its students each semester.
Because Computer Science is the largest major on campus, and because of computer science course requirements for all Georgia Tech students, SCI instructors teach more students from across campus every year than any other academic unit. To help with the high volume of students, the School hires and manages hundreds of teaching assistants every semester.
The new School also offers:
- The Junior Design Capstone, a two-semester course sequence where students work on software design projects for real-life clients.
- Two introductory computing classes remotely offered to high school students across Georgia through the state’s dual enrollment program.
- Three massive open online courses (MOOCs) created by school faculty that are among the five most popular in their subject, according to Class Central.
Beyond academics, SCI faculty do a considerable amount of research into effective, scalable computing education, including online. These efforts actively address the ongoing shortage of computing science educators at every level, which is vital to finding new ways for existing teachers to reach more students.
Olufisayo Omojokun, principal lecturer and former head of the Division of Computing Instruction, is the new School’s inaugural chair.
“We’ve been building toward this for a long time,” Omojokun said. “And becoming a school will provide the foundation for future growth and expansion. We will attract new talent and new resources. I’m excited to see what we can do going forward.”

New Software Developed by Associate Professor Could Improve Diabetic Foot Care
When it comes to developing computer solutions to social issues, School of Interactive Computing Associate Professor Rosa Arriaga looks to tell the stories of groups who are overlooked and underserved.
A new app Arriaga has in development amplifies the voices of patients with diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers — a severe complication for more than one third of people living with diabetes that often goes unaddressed until it’s too late.
If left untreated, a diabetic foot ulcer can become infected and lead to amputation. Arriaga’s app may be the tool that prevents the situation from ever coming to that. The app detects the presence of ulcers and tracks whether the conditions of the ulcers worsen.
To create the app, Arriaga partnered with researchers and doctors from the Emory School of Medicine and Grady Memorial Hospital. Their work caught the attention and support of the American Diabetes Association, which awarded them with a grant in January.
Arriaga and her collaborators were also among the first recipients of the A.I. Humanity Seed Grant Program, a collaborative effort between Georgia Tech and Emory University to expand partnerships and leverage artificial intelligence to improve society and quality of life.
“I had never come across diabetic foot ulcers,” Arriaga said. “The way I do research, I try to think of what the gold standard of care is in each domain, and then I think about how computing can help. This is that sweet spot where we can address a big problem and make an impact with relatively simple computing.”
Arriaga calls it the Diabetic Ulcer Computational Sensing System, which can be accessed through a mobile phone. It requires patients to use their phones to perform a foot health exam — documenting the condition of their skin, their sensations, their circulation, and their walking gait. Patients can also have a caregiver do these things for them if they are physically unable.
Who is at risk?
The looming problem of diabetic ulcers did not escape the attention of two assistant professors at the Emory School of Medicine: Maya Fayfman, who works in the Division of Endocrinology, and Marcos Schechter of the Division of Infectious Diseases. Working alongside Dr. Gabriel Santamarina, director of podiatry at Grady, they noticed the increase in amputations at Grady and how many of those patients came from underserved communities.
“Despite recent advances in diabetes treatments and improvements in other complications, diabetic foot ulcers and amputations are at best stable and by some measures on the rise,” Fayfman said. “They disproportionately impact people who are of the lowest means and suffer most from loss of mobility and inability to work.”
Many patients with diabetic foot complications don’t seek treatment because they don’t have the means to go to the doctor for checkups. The new app tackles this problem head on and allows patients to examine their affected foot and send results to their doctor remotely. The doctor can then determine whether the ulcer poses a threat of amputation. Arriaga said she hopes to add an algorithm to the app that can detect when the condition of an ulcer has worsened.
How ulcers go unnoticed
In addition to neglecting or not being able to access routine care, patients with diabetes often develop neuropathy, which can cause loss of feeling in the feet of diabetic patients. If a patient suffers a wound on the bottom of their foot, neuropathy may cause them not to feel it, and the wound can expand and become infected.
“People with healthy feet who develop an injury in their foot will adjust how they walk so they don’t apply as much pressure,” Fayfman said. “That pain is helpful in promoting healing. In patients with diabetes, that loss of sensation makes it so they’re not recognizing the pain, and their wounds get worse before being recognized.”
Schechter said increased awareness could go a long way to not only preventing amputations but saving lives. Diabetic patients are already immuno-compromised, and amputation leads to immobility and a decreased ability to fight illnesses, increasing the risk of the problem becoming fatal. Published research shows that the mortality rate for people who lose a limb due to diabetes is 70 percent within five years.
“A lot of people, when they come to us, the ulcers are very severe, and the limb can’t be saved,” he said. “If people could monitor this with pictures at home, and they could share these pictures with providers, or the app could predict whether this ulcer needs care right now, maybe that can prevent people from coming in with advance stages of the disease.”
A hub for communication
While the ADA is helping to fund the development of the app, the team believes the grant is an overdue step toward raising awareness about the seriousness of diabetic ulcers.
The researchers conducted a focus group of patients with ulcers and amputations and learned that many had never heard of diabetic foot ulcers before being diagnosed with one.
“That to me is the saddest part,” Arriaga said. “Some people are saying they were never told about it. On the one hand, that’s not comprehensive care, and on the other hand, the doctor must get to the biggest thing — let’s make sure we work on your sugar if you can only work on one thing. It all goes back to a fragmented health system.”
One of the app’s goals is bridging those gaps within the system by providing the opportunity to improve communication between patients and the doctors who treat them. Reducing redundancies in the system will lead to more affordable care while keeping patients and providers informed of the progression of ulcers.
“I think an ecological approach to diabetes care is essential for optimal health and wellness,” she said. “It is not enough to task one group of stakeholders with managing diabetes. Technology can connect the various stakeholders (i.e., patients, their caregivers, clinicians) so that diabetes foot care can be streamlined. It can also improve knowledge about foot care and alleviate the negative outcomes associated with foot ulcers.”
New Study Explores Sentiment Around Electric Vehicles, Leading to Faster Government Response and More Infrastructure
Policy makers have long been wanting to improve infrastructure needed for the adoption of electric vehicles (EV), but with mass amounts of unstructured data they have been unable to determine how charging stations are performing and where more need to be added, according to a recent study from Georgia Institute of Technology researchers.
Researchers in the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) and the School of Public Policy combined machine learning and social science frameworks to analyze reviews from EV users to determine the overall sentiment of their charging experience. Prior to this method, this process was done by hand and took on average 32 weeks. Now it can be completed via a computer in minutes, with the potential to update in near real-time, based on the study’s findings.
New System for Image Object Recognition Modernizes How Computers Learn Independently and Transfer Skills
A computer vision team at the Georgia Institute of Technology has developed a new approach for computers to train themselves on image object recognition.
The work modernizes how machine learning models that are trained in one area or domain can take that knowledge and apply it to accurately recognize objects in other domains, a practice known as visual domain adaptation. An example could be a computer capturing driving scenes from a massive open-world game like Grand Theft Auto 5 and using those to understand real-world objects on the road.
“Applications for this work are limitless when talking about how a machine could take one image set from a domain and apply it anywhere,” said Viraj Prabhu, Ph.D. student in computer science and co-lead author on the work.
Georgia Tech’s novel solution uses a popular image object recognition tool – the vision transformer (ViT) – and image data to allow a machine to perform self-supervised learning (SSL) on datasets, where no human assistance is used. The model that results is tested for its predictive capabilities to correctly classify objects in new images.
According to the researchers, the simple approach leads to consistent performance gains on standard object recognition benchmarks over competing methods that use ViTs and SSL.
For the machine to add to its library of training images, it has to correctly predict the objects in the images.
“Key to this approach is a new way to empower the machine to decide when an image from a new domain can reliably be used for learning,” said Judy Hoffman, assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing and the research’s faculty lead.
“As this algorithm operates without a person in the loop, the machine needs the ability to distinguish between images with minor changes that can be automatically adapted versus images with major changes that make automated adaptation riskier.”
The team’s work uses a built-in “attention” mechanism from ViTs together with a “greedy assignment algorithm” to produce images that are partially masked, with only the most salient parts of the images being viewable by the machine.
“If the machine makes the same prediction on the majority of masked views, then the image is deemed to be reliable enough to be incorporated into automated learning,” said Hoffman.
As the computer gets smarter at learning on its own it can take the known set of images and apply it to unknown sets, thereby creating new opportunities for visual domain adaptation.
The team calls its technique Probing Attention-Conditioned Masking Consistency (PACMAC). The work and code are detailed in the paper Adapting Self-Supervised Vision Transformers by Probing Attention-Conditioned Masking Consistency and is published in the 2022 proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, Nov. 28 – Dec. 9.
The authors, all from the School of Interactive Computing, include Prabhu, Sriram Yenamandra, Aaditya Singh, and Hoffman. The work was supported in part by funding from the DARPA LwLL project and ARL. The researchers’ views and statements are based on their findings and do not necessarily reflect those of the funding agencies.
New Tool Makes Misinformation Easier to Identify, Understand and Stop
One problem with misinformation is that most people don’t recognize it while browsing the internet. Even fewer understand where misleading content originates, which poses a challenge in stopping misinformation in its tracks.
To resolve this, researchers with the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and Avast Software have developed MisVis, a tool that can help online users identify and stop the spread of misinformation.
MisVis is an interactive tool that uses data visualization to alert users they are on a website containing misinformation. MisVis also shows how the page is connected in a web with other misinformation sources. As a result, MisVis helps casual and skeptical internet users alike identify misinformation and better understand how content is untrue.
“While working on this project, I found that many people are actually very worried and concerned about misinformation,” said School of CSE Ph.D. student Seongmin Lee. “Misinformation is a big issue and visualization is a good way to solve a lot of problems.”
MisVis developers joining Lee include:
- Sadia Afroz, Avast Software
- Duen Horng (Polo) Chau, Associate Professor with the School of CSE
- Haekyu Park, School of CSE Ph.D. student
- Ankit Peshin, Avast Software
- Vibhor Sehgal, Avast Software
- Omar Shaikh, Ph.D. student at Stanford University
- Zijie (Jay) Wang, School of CSE Ph.D. student
While many tools, like FactCheck and PolitiFact, exist to help online users discern fact from fiction, they have limits.
One problem is that fact correction sites attempt to explain misinformation through often lengthy written narratives. These can be too long to keep a reader’s attention causing them to stop reading. As a result, many are still misinformed because they didn’t receive a concise explanation.
MisVis not only alerts users when a website is spreading misinformation, it also shows how the website is connected to other sources of misinformation, including social media. As a result, MisVis shows users multiple sources of misinformation in less time and with less effort than reading a news-like story.
MisVis is intended for all internet users, casual and experienced alike. Lee explained how certain populations, such as teenagers and elderly adults, especially stand to benefit from MisVis as they may be vulnerable to misinformation. These users benefit from MisVis’ catchy, easy to read presentation.
The research group introduced MisVis in April 2022 and has been using data and questionnaire surveys to improve the tool. The team will present their updated findings Oct. 19 at IEEE VIS 2022 in Oklahoma City.
In a survey of 139 respondents, participants rated MisVis an average 4.32 out of 5 in usability. Lee explained that most respondents praised the tool’s reliability and credibility.
“Users have said MisVis is cool and fun to use,” Lee said. “One participant said that it is really easy and convenient, saving them the extra effort of checking other websites and searching on Google.”
The research group intends to further develop MisVis into a web browser extension. This will allow for broader usability and provide additional feedback toward improvement. The research group used only Twitter while building and testing MisVis, so expanding application to other social media platforms is another future goal for the group.
New Women-in-Technology Scholarship Recipient Had an Early Interest in AI
Megan Dass, a second-year computer science major, has been selected as a 2022 Adobe Research Women-in-Technology Scholar.
This highly competitive award is for undergraduates or master’s students studying artificial intelligence/machine learning, data science, computer science, or mobile/web development.
“I’m excited to join an equally passionate community of women,” Dass said. She has been doing research since the summer prior to her arrival at Tech with Duen Horng “Polo” Chau, associate professor of Computational Science and Engineering.
Dass became interested in artificial intelligence in middle school, after seeing a TED talk called Meet the SixthSense Interaction that was created by a lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
“I was astounded by the possibilities of using AI to make everyday things simple,” she said.
In high school, she reached out to faculty at the Harvard Medical School and Stanford Medical & Machine Learning Group and was able to do impactful augmented reality and artificial intelligence research with them remotely. She reached out to Chau the summer before she matriculated.
“Megan’s talent and potential to excel were obvious from the first time we met,” Chau said. “She has been a clear standout, with academic excellence, exceptional drive and passion for research, and strong work ethic.”
In her first week with Chau, Dass completed a project called Magic Crop, which takes photos and crops them to center on the subject’s face by utilizing artificial intelligence and photography’s rule of thirds. More recently, she was the first author on a paper submitted to IEEE VIS, the top visualization conference in the world. The paper was for an ongoing project called DARPA GARD, which centers on combatting adversarial attacks on AI models.
Dass aims to continue studying and pursuing high-impact research in the artificial intelligence and computer vision fields to prepare herself to achieve her eventual goal of using artificial intelligence for the betterment of society.
This is the second year in a row that a CS major from Georgia Tech has been named as an Adobe Research Women-in-Technology Scholar. Prerna Ravi earned the scholarship in 2021.
Newly Endowed Chair Underscores Value of Computational Journalism
The creator of Google News has endowed a new faculty chair position in computational journalism at Georgia Tech’s College of Computing.
Krishna Bharat – Georgia Tech alumnus (MS CS 1993, Ph.D. CS 1996) and Distinguished Research Scientist at Google – announced his donation during a reception at the College, held Oct. 31.
“Given the relative maturity of the field and the promise ahead, I felt this was the right time to create an endowed chair in computational journalism. This is a way for me to give back to Georgia Tech, and also to help the College of Computing expand its research portfolio, and show leadership in this important area,” said Bharat.
President Ángel Cabrera, Dean of Computing Charles Isbell, and members of the College's Advisory Board, along with dozens of faculty, staff, and students, attended the reception held in the Klaus Advanced Computing Building.
The Krishna A. Bharat Chair in Computational Journalism recognizes the College’s contributions to the field, which Georgia Tech is credited with creating in 2006. A nationwide search to fill the newly endowed chair position will begin in the coming months.
“Computing is now such a part of so many other fields that we cannot innovate, we cannot research, and we cannot teach in isolation. Journalism is central to informing and engaging citizens in a free society. It is a field that has both changed and been changed by computing,” said Isbell, who also holds the John P. Imlay Jr. Chair in Computing.
“The College is deeply thankful to Krishna Bharat and his wife, Kavita Thirumalai, for supporting our efforts in computational journalism, and enabling our faculty and students to further impact this most important area.”
Q&A with Google Distinguished Research Scientist Krishna Bharat
Bharat sat down this week for a few questions about computational journalism and his own journey from Georgia Tech to the top of the tech world.
GT Computing: What was your motivation for creating this endowed chair? Why do you want to associate your name with this research?
KB: When I was a Ph.D. student at the College of Computing in the early 90s, I built a piece of software to aggregate online news and construct a personalized newspaper. That project broke new ground technically, and it taught me a lot about applying computing to the processing and analysis of news. It also launched me on a successful career path that led to Google and Google News.
In the 25 years since then, that intersection between computing and news that I happened to explore has grown tremendously. Online news has exploded, and computing is used in every part of the news lifecycle and ecosystem. This field is now well established in practice, in a variety of institutions in the news space, but in academia somewhat less so.
Given the relative maturity of the field and the promise ahead, I felt this was the right time to create an endowed chair in computational journalism. This is a way for me to give back to Georgia Tech, and also to help the College expand its research portfolio and show leadership in this important area.
GT Computing: Why do you think computational journalism is a field worth supporting at this point in time? Where do you think the field is going?
KB: We are now poised at the beginning of a new AI revolution where machines can understand content and synthesize derivatives in powerful and useful ways. This is going to open up opportunities for research and innovation that will transform journalism going forward. Machine intelligence will help journalists scale their efforts to source stories and build compelling new narrative experiences based on data and in-depth reporting. Technology in newsrooms, platforms, and consumer apps will evolve how news content is packaged, distributed, monetized, personalized, and optimized for consumer satisfaction – and publisher revenue.
While technology holds a lot of promise, it can also create challenges for publishers and society -- ranging from information overload and filter bubbles to disinformation and manipulation by outside actors. Publishers face business model challenges in a crowded and continuously evolving ecosystem. There is both a need to study these phenomena and craft solutions that will in part, depend on computing.
Also, using computing as a social science tool, we can address and answer fundamental questions about the quality, diversity, and utility of the news that consumers get. We can assess its impact on our society and democracy by analyzing data at scale.
While a lot of the innovation is happening in technology companies and publishing houses, academia still has a big role to play. Many of the technologies that matter are pioneered in universities. Academia can focus broadly on the public good and take a long-term view of technology. They can innovate both on the practice and analysis of news, and bring expertise to bear from many disciplines.
GT Computing: How did you get interested in computational journalism? Did working on Google News spark your interest?
KB: I have always had a deep interest in the news. When I grew up in India we used to get multiple newspapers at home as well as local and foreign magazines. We would also listen to the news on the radio and television. The divergence in reporting between different channels and their complementary nature has always been fascinating to me.
I got a chance to apply computing to news when I was doing my Ph.D. at Georgia Tech. After this though, I joined Google to work on web search. However, when the September 11th attacks happened I became super interested in computing with the news again. My explorations led to Google News, a platform to crawl index and aggregate news to support search and automated headlines on Google. Our mission was to help users understand the news better by presenting them with a diverse set of articles on a given news story. That product has since grown internationally and provides consumer access to relevant news and traffic to publishers worldwide.
This certainly advanced my interest in computational journalism. I also co-teach a course on this topic at Stanford, where we have students work in interdisciplinary groups to apply computing to journalism challenges.
GT Computing: You mentioned your work at Stanford University and you also have a connection to Columbia University’s computational journalism program. What do you think Georgia Tech brings to the table that other schools might be missing?
KB: I have a personal connection to Georgia Tech. I got my Ph.D. here and was inspired to work on projects that transformed my career.
Beyond this, however, one thing I found unique about Georgia Tech is its emphasis on interdisciplinary research and the collaborations it builds with an eye to the future. The GVU Center, which I was a part of, is a great example of this. (Professor Emeritus) Jim Foley brought together researchers in HCI, Animation, Robotics, Visualization, VR, Psychology, Industrial Engineering, Ubiquitous Computing, etc. to work together on projects that were trying to look ahead and invent how computing could integrate into our lives. We were one of the earliest groups to work on the WWW, starting in the first year of its existence. The center was extremely successful and the Institute has replicated this model many times since.
GT Computing: What advice would you give to students who are interested in learning and working at the intersection of computing and journalism?
KB: One thing I have found is that since news touches everyone, every computer scientist has some intuition on how to apply computing to the news. What they often need is exposure to real data and use cases to test out their ideas and develop new ones.
Fortunately, there are many avenues for that -- especially in an institute that encourages collaboration with practitioners. Working in interdisciplinary teams is important, teaming up with journalists or people with experience with the news. Also, I find that almost every subfield within computing seems to have relevance to computational journalism and the ability to contribute valuable technologies.
Deep learning, in particular, has direct applicability. As the AI technology used to understand text, audio, and video improves, you can think of ways to apply it to tasks of interest in the news lifecycle. There is a lot of low hanging fruit there. The Computation+Journalism symposium features interesting research that can serve as inspiration.
GT Computing: Finally, you did both an MS and a Ph.D. at GT Computing. Can you give an example of how your experience at Tech helped you build a successful career? What have you learned that you think could benefit current students?
KB: One of the things I think proved really useful during my Ph.D. was the opportunity to meet with practitioners both in their environment and in ours. We would travel to Silicon Valley to meet with companies like Sun Microsystems and SGI and understand the problems they cared about. We also had a constant stream of visitors to our lab from industry, government and other universities to see demos of our prototypes.
This constant feedback loop helped ground our research in reality and the needs of the real world. We had to articulate our vision and clarify how we were planning to make a difference to the state of the art.
When we were being naive in our approach or had blind spots, they would tell us and we would learn from it and course correct. I think that kind of feedback loop is worth seeking out. It helps you orient your research correctly and prepares you for a successful career when you graduate.
Newly Named Director Sets Sights on Achieving School Status for DCI
The College of Computing is proud to announce the appointment of Olufisayo “Fisayo” Omojokun as the new director of the Division of Computing Instruction, or DCI.
Omojokun is a senior lecturer in DCI and has been serving as the interim director of the division for the last eight months.
He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2006. After graduating, he joined the College of Computing as a postdoctoral fellow and then transitioned into a full-time lecturer role. He was a co-recipient of Georgia Tech’s 2019 Curriculum Innovation Award and he was named a James G. Pope CREATE-X Fellow in 2020. February.
“I’ve grown from a post-doc to DCI director in my approximately fifteen years at the Institute,” said Omojokun. “In that time, a lot of great things have happened in DCI, the College, and the Institute. I’d like to do my part in continuing this string of successes, and a leadership position gives me the opportunity to do so.”
While teaching a few upper-level courses, DCI lecturer-track faculty members primarily teach introductory computer science (CS) courses to first and second-year CS and Computational Media majors. And, because of a requirement for every Georgia Tech student to take an introductory programming course, DCI faculty actually teach every undergraduate student on campus.
Omojokun says his priorities are to expand the faculty of DCI and to streamline the TA hiring process. He will also begin work on the complicated process of transforming the division into a full-fledged school.
[RELATED: Computing Now Teaching Every Undergrad, Often Multiple Times]
“DCI existing as a school will give us the recognition, autonomy, and resources that are needed to meet the several challenges that we are facing,” Omojokun said. “But that vision will take a team effort. I want to say to my colleagues that I truly welcome your ideas. Please reach out to me any time, because my door is always open for in-person or virtual meetings.”
“I extend the same invitation to the students,” he added. “I will perform my job fully aware that DCI exists because of you. You can e-mail me or stop by my office any time.”
Omojokun will start as director on September 1.
"Fisayo is a proven leader and innovator, and he has done an excellent job as the interim chair of the division over the past eight months," said Charles Isbell, dean of the College of Computing and John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
“I look forward to seeing what DCI will accomplish under his leadership.”
Newly Named Founding Chair Recognizes 'Cybersecurity Revolves Around Problems, Not Academic Disciplines'
The College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology is proud to announce it has selected Michael Bailey as the founding chair of its School of Cybersecurity and Privacy.
Bailey comes to Tech from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he is a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
“I am enthusiastic about my new role as the founding chair of the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy,” Bailey said. “The students, staff, and faculty of Georgia Tech have a sterling record of achievement. I look forward to working with them to create a deeply satisfying future for the department — one in which our use-inspired, multidisciplinary view of cybersecurity and privacy is a positive force for change.”
Prior to Illinois, Bailey was a Research Associate Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Michigan. He has also worked at Amoco Corporation, Andersen Consulting, and three startups, including a stint as the Director of Engineering at Arbor Networks.
At Arbor, Bailey managed a team of more than 30 engineers whose software protected 70 percent of the entire internet’s transit traffic against distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. He is a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
“Michael is an experienced manager who is a veteran of higher education and in industry,” said Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay Chair of the College of Computing. “He understands that cybersecurity revolves around problems, not academic disciplines, which is crucially important for this inter-college school. I am pleased to welcome him to his new role at Tech.”
The School of Cybersecurity and Privacy brings together 40 faculty members from the College of Computing, the College of Engineering, the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, the Scheller College of Business, and the Georgia Tech Research Institute. The school was founded in 2020, with Richard DeMillo serving as interim until the hire of Bailey as its first and founding chair.
“Congratulations to Michael on being named chair of one of our newest schools at Georgia Tech,” said Kaye Husbands Fealing, dean and Ivan Allen, Jr. chair of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. “It is increasingly important that we continue to collaborate across disciplines to thoroughly capture all aspects of cybersecurity, including our strengths in public policy and governance. Our Ivan Allen College faculty are looking forward to collaborating with members of SCP.”
“As an international leader in engineering, computing, and public policy, Georgia Tech researchers stand at the intersection of cybersecurity and privacy,” said Raheem Beyah, dean of the College of Engineering and Southern Company Chair. “Michael’s leadership skills and research background will elevate our faculty as they continue to define the future of the field. The College of Engineering and I look forward to collaborating with Michael upon his arrival at Georgia Tech.”
Nationally ranked, innovative, interdisciplinary, and definitive, SCP draws skilled cybersecurity professionals from technology, policy, business, and practical fields to meet a rising national and international demand. Housed within the nationally ranked College of Computing, this new school builds on Georgia Tech’s 20-year investment to further develop the research and education of cybersecurity and privacy.
Georgia Tech has been ranked #2 in undergraduate cybersecurity education by U.S. News & World Report. The Institute receives more than $180 million in annual cybersecurity research awards and has 200,000 square feet of classified research space. There are more than 1300 master’s students and 70 Ph.D. students studying cybersecurity and privacy at Georgia Tech.
Nine Machine Learning Faculty Members Win Teaching Awards
Nine faculty members at the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) were recognized by the Georgia Tech Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) for receiving outstanding responses on the Course Instructor Opinion Survey (CIOS). The awards honor excellence in teaching for spring and fall 2020.
NSF Awards $1.7M to Foster AI Literacy Through Interactive Exhibits
The National Science Foundation has awarded a new $1.7 million grant to a Georgia Institute of Technology-led team to foster artificial intelligence (AI) literacy through interactive museum exhibits.
The grant will support the transition of previously-created AI prototypes into public-facing exhibits that spark creativity and collaboration in learning about artificial intelligence. The team will work with the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago and The Findings Group to create and evaluate the exhibits.
The team includes Brian Magerko, professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Literature, Media, and Communication with a dual appointment in the School of Interactive Computing (IC); Jessica Roberts, assistant professor in the School of IC; and Duri Long, assistant professor in Communication Studies at Northwestern University. Long (HCC Ph.D. 21) previously was a research scientist and Ph.D. student in human-centered computing at Georgia Tech.
“We have this lucky opportunity to take these cool, unique AI-based experiences and put them under the microscope to help understand how to better design AI literacy interventions based in embodiment and creativity,” says Magerko. “The goal is to have exhibits that can be used in multiple places all over the world.”
[RELATED: Multimillion Dollar NSF Grant Will Help to Advance Online Learning]
The projects include LuminAI, an AI-based dance experience created by Magerko and his team that allows people to dance with an AI dancer performer via their shadows. LuminAI uses Microsoft Kinect videogame devices to capture the movements of a human dance partner and projects them as a silhouette onto a screen. The computer then uses artificial intelligence based on theories of dance and movement — called Viewpoints and Laban Movement Analysis — to determine how to match the human partner’s moves.
“Usually when you see AI exhibits, they’re very focused on robotics technology, hardware – the cool factor. But how we interact with the AI is very narrow. We’re really hoping to broaden people’s perception of what AI is and engage with them in a different and very human way that enables them to understand and reflect on the different aspects of AI technologies in a more meaningful way,” says Magerko.
Other projects developed during the height of the pandemic will be adapted for larger exhibits. They include Creature Features, a take-home project that teaches how to train neural networks, and Knowledge Net, an at-home project that allows students to “pre-program” an AI chatbot with knowledge.
NSF Grant Could Lead to Better Computational Tools for Human Fact Checkers
The spread of misinformation online on social media platforms has presented immediate challenges with potentially dire consequences, particularly around topics like public health and election integrity.
A $750,000 grant from the National Science Foundation could help give human fact checkers the computational tools needed to accurately and efficiently push back against this growing swell.
As part of a larger $21 million investment made by the NSF, Georgia Tech researchers and collaborators at the University of Wisconsin and Washington State University will examine the spread of misinformation, how that is fact checked, the challenges that prevent accurate and efficient correction, and the messaging within those corrections that may impact public trust. The team will comprise computer scientists, journalists, mass communications experts, psychologists, and political scientists.
“Right now, fact checkers look at trending articles, do a deep dive, and spend hours to determine whether or not it is misinformation,” said School of Computational Science and Engineering Assistant Professor Srijan Kumar, a co-principal investigator on the project. “Within this are a number of biases: popularity biases in that only popular articles are examined, fact checking is slow, and it is language and region restricted. That’s where we want to bring a computational approach to improve the process.”
The Georgia Tech team, which also includes co-PI Munmun De Choudhury of the School of Interactive Computing, will focus on the computational element of the project by developing machine learning and artificial intelligence-based detectors. They will create algorithms that look not just at a piece of information, but also patterns like who is sharing, how it spreads through the network, and other attributes that can be fused together to create more efficient detection models.
“We want to empower fact checkers to be able to do their jobs more efficiently,” De Choudhury said. “How can they detect misinformation, provide corrections, and do so in a way that encourages public trust? That involves people of many different fields as you navigate complex ecosystems of values, ideologies, and beliefs.”
The project will look at misinformation in two of the most pressing areas: public health, including Covid-19 and vaccination misinformation, and election integrity. Information gleaned from this project and corresponding solutions, the researchers say, could be applied to additional areas of misinformation in the future.
The project is titled How Large-Scale Identification and Intervention Can Empower Professional Fact-Checkers to Improve Democracy and Public Health. The project grows out of a previous grant from the NSF for Rapid Research Response (RAPID), titled Tackling the Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis, which was also led by De Choudhury and Kumar.
NYT R&D Team to Discuss Technology’s Impact on Journalism in Live, Virtual Event
This month, The Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) is co-hosting a live, virtual event featuring the New York Times Research and Development (R&D) team.
Set for Oct. 30 in collaboration with the University of California, Berkeley, members of the R&D team will participate in a virtual conversation to discuss how the Times is embracing new technologies within photogrammetry and spatial computing to bring their readers as close to a story as possible. For example, attendees will get insights into their latest project including reconstructing journalistic scenes in 3D from hurricane disasters to an artist’s apartment.
OMSCS Alumnus Goes from TA to College Instructor
Rocko Graziano had spent 30 years working his way up the ladder in private sector IT, but knew he wanted to do something different before he retired. Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science Computer Science (OMSCS) let him transition into teaching.
“I’d dabbled and done about everything you can in an IT career in those years—from software development security to leading the construction of a LEED-certified data center—all while getting married and raising a family in Maine,” Graziano said.
Finding OMSCS
After three decades in the private sector, Graziano wondered what would be next for him and his wife, Robyn, a high school math teacher. When Robyn started an online master’s in mathematics, Graziano looked into going back to school himself and transitioning to a career where they could both have summers off.
Although he had a lot of practical experience, Graziano hadn’t formally studied computer science since his bachelor’s at Boston College. All that changed when he found and applied to OMSCS in 2015.
Learning the content was almost more challenging than transitioning to student life again.
“Comparing my undergraduate days to OMSCS is like comparing a horse and buggy to a Tesla,” he said. “The power of personal computers these days, the vast amounts of data we have to work with, and number of things you can download for free over internet—none of that existed 30 years ago and now it’s open source.”
Despite planning to study interactive intelligence, he fell in love with the hands-on application of algorithms after taking Professor Thad Starner’s artificial intelligence (AI) class. Graziano switched to the machine learning track and continued to work with Starner on a special research project that uses AI to detect and combat plagiarism at Georgia Tech.
Rediscovering Teaching
This work resonated with Graziano because he knew he also wanted to teach once he earned his degree. He had been a teaching assistant (TA) as an undergraduate and occasionally hosted training seminars in his corporate career. After enjoying graduate algorithms, he applied to be a TA for the class.
“I really liked the material and wanted to give back,” he said. “I knew teaching was something I wanted to do and that a degree from Georgia Tech would make it possible.”
Becoming a TA in OMSCS set up Graziano’s career change as a college-level educator. The experience of learning how to manage a class at scale — drafting exams and grading rubrics, preparing office hours, and supporting hundreds of students across multiple time zones – provided valuable experience to jump start his transition to academia.
Throughout his OMSCS career, Graziano was serving of the Board of Visitors at the University of Maine, Augusta (UMA) and knew the school had opportunities in its new data sciences program. After he graduated OMSCS in 2019, he joined UMA as an adjunct in the Fall of 2020 and became a full-time lecturer this past January.
Graziano’s OMSCS experience prepared him for UMA’s distanced learning degree structure where more than 60 percent of credits are delivered online.
“I know what it’s like to watch asynchronous lectures and submit assignments online, so the materials I’m building for my classes replicate my good experiences from OMSCS,” he said. “The majority OMSCS teachers went out of the way to make lectures engaging and build up discussion through a series of videos.”
Despite working full-time at UMA, Graziano is still an OMSCS TA. It’s important to him to stay connected to the program.
“I was able to retire from the private sector when I wanted,” he said. “I knew I had another 10 years in my career, but I just wanted to do something completely different and OMSCS was the gateway.”
OMSCS: The Revolution Will Be Digitized
What is common to a uniformed worker for the New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY), a Lieutenant Colonel in the Indian Army stationed in the northern Himalayas, and an Assistant Professor at Augusta University in Georgia? They are graduates of the Online Master’s of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
Yan Litvak, a largely self-taught programmer, decided after a decade working as a coding developer to “go play with big toys” – operate heavy equipment at the DSNY – while he earned undergraduate and graduate degrees. OMSCS was his choice for a graduate program compatible with a full-time job that entails emergency first response, as well as raising two toddlers.
Harkirat S. Virk, deployed at the ‘top of the world’ had to travel half a day to reach network connectivity, and was unable to take the proctored OMSCS exams on the due dates. After graduation, however, he was awarded the Chief of the Army Staff Commendation for his contributions in the field of Cyber Security.
Paul York holds a Ph.D. in Management Information Systems, but looked for firmer grounding in computer science. He regularly leverages his OMSCS education for his courses at the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences.
With nearly 10,000 students and more than 2,000 alumni, OMSCS, the largest master’s program in computer science (CS) in the nation, provides a diverse and wide ranging body of students with an unprecedented opportunity.
It all began in a meeting between Zvi Galil, the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing, and Sebastian Thrun. A visionary scientist and entrepreneur, Thrun offered the very first massive open online course (MOOC) in the fall of 2011 while a professor at Stanford University. Continuing his efforts to democratize higher education, Thrun co-founded Udacity in early 2012.
When they met, Thrun proposed to Galil the launching of a degree program at the College of Computing (GT Computing) using MOOC technology, making it radically more accessible and affordable than on-campus options. This was a fundamental, revolutionary shift from the prevailing paradigm of higher education, in which a brand is bolstered by exclusion and high tuition fees.
[VIDEO: Georgia Tech and the Need for OMSCS]
Galil set to work. A faculty working group was convened - Kishore Ramachandran (chair), Tucker Balch, Frank Dellaert, Nick Feamster, Jim Foley, Guy Lebanon, Alex Orso, Patrick Traynor, Rich Vuduc, and Bob Waters. They were concerned with maintaining the quality of GT Computing’s academic content, the logistics, and the student and faculty experience.
“We involved the faculty throughout the process of creating the program through town halls,” said Ramachandran, professor in School of Computer Science. “The document created by the working group became the operational manual for putting the program into practice.”
At the end of six months, the faculty voted to move forward. The program then earned the support of Georgia Tech President G.P. “Bud” Peterson and Rafael L. Bras, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs and K. Harrison Brown Family Chair, who advocated for it with the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia.
While the faculty planned, Galil and Thrun sought funding to cover the costs of preparing and launching the first courses. In January 2013 they met with AT&T executives Randall Stephenson, the chairman, chief executive officer, and president, and William Blase, the senior executive vice president for human resources. Both saw the educational opportunities and offered a $2 million gift, supplemented a year later by another $2 million.
This generous support signaled to Georgia Tech the potential of the program. “AT&T’s financial support was more crucial than we knew at the time. Without it, we could never have developed the program so rapidly. They were truly OMSCS’ ‘angels’.
“The program has been financially self-maintaining since its third year, and overall has netted Georgia Tech $13 million,” Galil said.
By May 2013, the Board of Regents had approved the degree. In January 2014, OMSCS was launched with 380 students – the ‘Pioneers’ – and five courses:
- Computer Networks taught by Nick Feamster
- Software Development Process by Alex Orso
- Machine Learning by Charles Isbell and Michael Littman (Brown University)
- AI for Robotics by Sebastian Thrun
- Advanced Operating Systems by Kishore Ramachandran
The program’s growth has been staggering. Five years later, OMSCS offers 30 courses to nearly 10,000 students.
Progress and Service
Galil took the words emblazoned on the seal of Georgia Tech – “Progress and Service” – to characterize his mission to expand access to quality learning opportunities, by using technology to mitigate obstructions of time, space, and financial ability. To start with, Galil committed the program to a unique admissions policy: accepting every student deemed to have a reasonable chance of success. Admissions standards are rigorous, but not exclusionary. Of more than 26,000 applicants, 66 percent have been admitted.
These attributes, along with quality content, have helped to ensure the success of OMSCS. “Our data and experience strongly suggest there is nothing inferior about the online course experience,” said David Joyner, associate director of student experience and the faculty member who has taught the most OMSCS students. “Our students regularly rate their online courses as better than on-campus courses they’ve taken in the past, and in our most well-controlled experiments online students regularly match (or exceed) the performance of their on-campus counterparts.”Added to the novel admissions policy, Galil insisted on keeping OMSCS tuition affordable – less than $7,000 for the full degree, payable by course, rather than $40,000 for a public on-campus program, or $70,000 or more in a private university.
The success of the program is also evident in the rankings. Since OMSCS launched, the College of Computing has climbed up the rankings of graduate computer science programs, rising spot to No. 8 in the 2018 rankings of U.S. News and World Report, tied with Princeton. The graduate program rose in both points and ranking—and was the only Top 10 program to rise in either.
“This achievement upends the popular trope that holds that you can infer a college’s quality and prestige from its low acceptance rates and high tuition,” Galil said.
Galil attributes the high ranking to “GT Computing’s visible leadership in computing education and research, to the fact that we are one of the largest computing programs in the United States, and to the global impact we are having through our research and the work of our thousands of alumni.”
Another result of the program’s success is the spirit of community and of service, which Galil says is palpable. OMSCS students have created and lead more than 70 online forums. Students across states and countries (all 50 states, about 120 countries) coordinate projects across time zones. They share solutions and support each other – and offer advice to prospective applicants. Graduates, typically computing professionals with full-time jobs and family, consistently volunteer: In Spring 2019, 65 out of the 282 teaching assistants for the program are OMSCS alumni, and 109 more are current OMSCS students. “The OMSCS program’s sense of community and esprit de corps effortlessly spans the globe,” Galil said.
Broadening the pipeline
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Science Foundation, one million computing jobs in the U.S. will go unfilled by 2020. The throughput of computing degrees across all institutions of higher education in the U.S. is not keeping up with increased demand, driven by the changing requirements of a thriving 21st century economy.
OMSCS however, is proving to be a global game-changer. Harvard University researchers in a study found that the OMSCS program is responsible for a seven percent increase in the number of master’s degrees in computer science attained each year in the U.S. The same study showed that most applicants would not pursue an advanced degree at all if it were not online and highly affordable.
The implications of OMSCS have not gone unnoticed, and both the program and its founders have been widely recognized both inside and outside of higher education. In 2017, the University Professional and Continuing Education Association gave OMSCS its National Program Excellence Award. In 2017, Georgia Tech appeared on Fast Company’s list of most innovative companies in the world – the third university recognized on the list, and the first recognized for education rather than research – on the strength of the OMSCS program. And, the program has appeared in more than 1,200 news articles, including more than 50 in the Chronicle of Higher Education and Inside Higher Ed. In other words, the OMSCS program measurably broadens the pipeline of computing professionals, and from 2018 is graduating more than 1,000 students annually.
OMSCS’ success has inspired similar programs at other universities - more than 40 MOOC-based M.S. degree programs have been launched recently. Georgia Tech itself has launched two additional online master’s degrees, one in analytics and one in cybersecurity.
Expanding tomorrow’s opportunity
The realignment of today’s workforce with tomorrow’s economy requires more than plugging shortages of master’s degrees. The shortfall in technology education permeates every level of study. There are 1.6 million students in K-12 education in the state of Georgia alone, but only 95 qualified computer science teachers.
Galil believes that the MOOC-based technology that powers the OMSCS degree offers some solutions. Under Galil’s direction, GT Computing now offers an online version of its introductory computing course to undergraduates, who report liking it as much or more than their in-person courses. Two more introductory courses are being prepared and will be made available to Georgia Tech residential undergraduates, University System of Georgia students, as well as Georgia high school students.
“Eventually, we may find students spending less of their time on campus,” Galil maintains. “They may start their courses while living at home, or combine online learning with internships and co-ops. They may complete their degree while already at a job. We hope that this will help reduce the cost of a university education.”
This same online teaching technologies can be used to expand the availability of computer science in K-12 schools. The Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech – yet another important initiative launched during Galil’s tenure as dean – is developing a hybrid model of online and in-person instruction that will allow far more students to participate. In the past year, a group of Constellations Fellows has worked with more than 200 students in the Atlanta public schools, teaching them computer science and refining the hybrid model.
“Georgia Tech and the College of Computing are dedicated to finding ways to use technology to expand the impact of computer science education.
“As a public university, our responsibility is both to the students we serve and to the nation, and OMSCS is pioneering this change in the educational landscape with both responsibilities in mind. Our future depends upon it,” said Galil.
Online CS Course Gives Students Unique Opportunity
A new online computer science course is giving students the opportunity to put their education and skills to use to solve real world problems.
The Computing for Good course draws on both the self-focused and altruistic sides of students by presenting computer science as a viable way to solve problems of personal interest as well as problems that are important to society.
During the class, students work with nonprofits and other organizations to develop computing solutions to aid them in their mission. Past projects have been devoted to promoting education and awareness of environmental and food access issues.
Although the course has been offered before in-person, this past spring was the first time the course was offered online as part of Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program. The recent class included ten student projects, with around half of these being tested and deployed into use by the partner organizations.
Computer Science Professor Santosh Vempala, who teaches the course, said it gives students an opportunity to use their knowledge and skills in a real-world application.
“It’s hard to find a domain where some kind of computer science or computing idea won’t be useful,” Vempala said. “Anything from a website that works well or a way to streamline a process would be helpful.
“All of the focus is on making the best possible contribution to the organization’s effort, but the students also learn a lot about using what they know to create a practical solution,” Vempala said.
Dante Ciolfi, an OMSCS alumnis and the head teaching assistant for the course, said that the students he worked with loved the class and the challenge of their chosen project.
“Students that take course, they want to make this impact and they’re excited about its project-based nature and the opportunity to make a difference,” he said. “I like when students accomplish something and challenge themselves. We saw a lot of that, and it was a cool experience to see it all come together.”
OMSCS student Iris Ho’s project focused on a program that could be used by secondary schools to help students who may be at risk.
The program they created used machine learning to predict which students might need extra attention or help in the classroom. The group partnered with a New York City public school and tested the project on the school’s eighth grade students.
Ho said that the school was temporarily able to implement their project and that many of the school’s teachers found it was a useful tool to aid their students.
“When you're developing and testing something, there are always some frustrations. But being able to create a goal and propose our idea and then seeing that be fulfilled was the really exciting part of the course,” Ho said.
Online Cyber Student Publishes Cybersecurity Book for Kids
A graduate student in the Master of Science in Cybersecurity – Online (OMS Cybersecurity) program at Georgia Tech is celebrating the release of her second children’s book, Oh, No ...Hacked Again!: A Story About Online Safety.
Inspired by the life events of her own four children, author Zinet Kemal breaks down common cybersecurity concepts in the book such as phishing schemes, password security, two-factor authentication, and IP addresses in a way kids understand.
“I wanted to show kids a grown-up who works in cybersecurity as well as spark the interest of young readers who look like me to see cybersecurity as a career option while also seeing themselves in the story,” Kemal added.
The story is told through the eyes of Elham, an eight-year-old girl from Minnesota who comes to find her favorite online game account has been comprised for the second time. As the events of the book unfold, Elham’s mother, a cybersecurity professional, talks with her about making safe online choices, recognizing phishing schemes, and how to set up a two-step authorization for her account.
“The idea to write a book about our experience came to me during the start of the pandemic, and I couldn't let it go,” Kemal said. “Today’s kids are always online, and I want to teach them safe online habits and basic cyber hygiene.”
The self-published author wrote her first book, Proud in Her Hijab: A Story of Family Strength, Empowerment, and Identity, in 2021 to empower girls who wear hijabs to be proud of their identities and create awareness for the practice. Kemal encourages her readers to appreciate the importance of diversity, other cultures, and faith. The book topped the Amazon bestseller list and received the 2021 Distinguished Authors Guild and 2022 Literary Titans Book Award. All four of her children are characters and the inspiration for her stories.
When she is not writing, Kemal works as an associate cloud security engineer for Best Buy and continues to work on her graduate degree from the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy at Georgia Tech.
Before launching a career in cybersecurity and authoring children’s books, Kemal had a legal career in Ethiopia. She and her husband immigrated to the United States in 2013 with their three-year-old son. During the move, Kemal was seven months pregnant with Elham, the inspiration for her second book.
Once the family settled in Minnesota, Kemal began working to earn her associate degree in computer programming. After transferring to Metropolitan University to earn her bachelor’s in computer science, she participated in the Minnesota Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition where her team placed third. Kemal realized her passion for cybersecurity while working alongside her teammates to defend their computer network from the event’s professional hackers.
“I didn’t know of cybersecurity at first, I just thought I would just be a programmer after completing the program,” she said. “I have always wanted to help build things to solve problems and once I found cyber, I never looked back.”
After completing her undergraduate degree, completing multiple IT internships, and finding her first full time role, Kemal applied to the newly established OMS Cybersecurity program at Georgia Tech. She is currently enrolled in the policy track of the graduate program but has taken courses in all three of the interdisciplinary fields the degree covers- Cyber Physical Systems, Information Security, and Policy.
The online format offered through Georgia Tech Professional Education has allowed her to juggle being a mother of four and a full-time cybersecurity professional.
“What's great about OMS Cybersecurity is the rigor of the online program is the same as on-campus,” she said. “I can set my own pace and do what works for me and my family.”
Kemal was recently a keynote speaker at the SANS Institute New2Cyber Summit 2022 where she shared how she has taken her background from a legal career and applied it to her new career in cybersecurity. When she graduates later this year, Kemal will have a post graduate certificate in international trade law, two bachelor's degrees, an associate degree, and a dozen certifications to compliment her master's degree from Georgia Tech.
Park Named as New School of Computational Science and Engineering Chair
The College of Computing is proud to announce the appointment of Haesun Park as the new chair of its School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE).
“Haesun is not only a cutting-edge researcher, but has experience managing cutting-edge researchers, including for the National Science Foundation,” said Charles Isbell, Dean and John P. Imlay, Jr. Professor of the College of Computing. “She will be a valuable leader for the School of Computational Science and Engineering and for the College of Computing, and I look forward to working with her.
Park joined the School of Computational Science and Engineering in 2005 and has been a Regents’ Professor since 2019. During that time she served as the associate chair of the school and participated in creating new Ph.D. and MS degree programs in CSE. She also served as the executive director of the Center for Data Analytics, and as the director of the NSF-funded Foundations of Data and Visual Analytics Center. Before coming to Tech, Park served as a program director in the Computing and Communication Foundations Division at the National Science Foundation.
Park is a fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) and of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

Park will begin as chair on Monday, August 10. Please join Dean Isbell in congratulating her and the School of Computational Science and Engineering on this new chapter.
Partnership with Meta Brings New Online Machine Learning Resources to HBCUs
Georgia Tech and Meta have launched a new co-teaching initiative, the Artificial Intelligence Learning Alliance (AILA), with the goal of bringing graduate-level machine learning educational opportunities to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other minority-serving institutions (MSIs).
For context, only 3.8 percent of computing Ph.D. graduates in 2020 were Black, Hispanic, or Native American, in a time when the field is desperately short of labor. And without a diverse machine learning workforce, it is less likely that artificial intelligence products and projects will serve diverse audiences well. Finally, machine learning is a topic that changes constantly, making it difficult for many institutions to stay on the cutting edge of the field.
AILA builds on an online deep learning course co-taught by Facebook researchers and Zsolt Kira, assistant professor of machine learning and co-director of the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech (ML@GT). That course combines theory and practice using current examples from Facebook’s ongoing research and has been taught to 2,400 Georgia Tech students so far.
“The Facebook lectures provide students with real-world examples and techniques that are needed to deploy and scale algorithms,” Kira said. “This is something that students always ask me for and being able to provide them this information from a large, well-known company that uses these algorithms to process billions of pieces of data per day is invaluable.”
AILA is creating a consortium of HBCUs and other MSIs to build on that success. The courses will be available online, for free, through online learning platform Meta Blueprint. Faculty at member institutions will have access to a series of webinars on how to teach some or all the course content as part of their curriculum. Students will have the opportunity to work on real-life projects with Meta researchers. Grant funding will also be available.
“Teaming up with Georgia Tech to create AILA was a deeply thought out partnership that took a lot of effort We were looking to collaborate with a university known for producing large numbers of graduates from diverse backgrounds, and OMSCS, Tech’s Online Master of Science in Computer Science, is one of the country’s leading programs in doing just that,” according to Meta's blog post announcing the partnership.
“The Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech is committed to creating the next generation of leadership in innovative, sustainable and ethical AI,” said Irfan Essa, senior associate dean of computing and ML@GT director. AILA allows us to reach out beyond our own degree programs and help to train future AI experts across the state and the nation.”
AILA launches with Georgia Tech and eight other member universities from across the country:
- Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University
- Morgan State University
- Alabama A&M University
- University of Central Florida
- Georgia State University
- Florida International University
- University of California Irvine
- North Carolina A&T State University
“We have already seen algorithmic bias in AI systems in areas including health care, banking, hiring, and criminal justice,” said Charles Isbell, Dean and John P. Imlay Jr. Chair of Computing. “We need a larger and more diverse machine learning workforce to identify and eliminate those biases, and to make sure that AI is responsive to all of the communities it affects.”
Payne is Proof of the Impact of Teachers and Hopes to Have Lasting Effect on APS Students
Yolanda Payne is living proof of the difference that one person can make in someone’s life. Payne fully believes that if different people, especially teachers, didn’t intervene and encourage her at various moments in her life, she would not be where she is today.
Payne Selected as 2020-21 CS for All Teachers Community Ambassador
Yolanda Payne, a fellow at the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech, has been selected as a 2020-21 CS for All Teachers Community Ambassador.
Selected through a blind review process from a pool of more than 60 applicants, Payne is one of 12 ambassadors. The group consists of PreK through grade 12 computer science educators at national, district/county, and school levels from across the United States.
A Personal Reflection From Dean of Computing Charles Isbell
I’ve thought a lot about it since, but at the time all I could think was: “That’s a really big gun.”
I was at a capital-T Traffic Stop somewhere outside of Cambridge, MA. A police officer was approaching me on the driver’s side and for some reason, he went for his gun and yelled at me to be still. I got… stiller… and eventually, it was all over and I drove away.
Only later, while trying to calm down my friends did I think, “He could have killed me”.
I’m not sure exactly when that changed to “…and he would have gotten away with it”. I think it was April 29, 1992. That was a day much like the days we’re experiencing now.
In the many years since my thoughts have returned to that night. They became “…and would anyone have heard about it?” They became, “…and if they did what would they have heard?” Would the reports say I led a high-speed chase? Would the pundits say that if only I’d complied, I’d be alive? What would they have dredged up? Maybe somehow that time in seventh grade when I checked out Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret from the library would be held against me.
I don’t know, but it would have been something, and it would be like dying twice.
It’s not always the Traffic Stop. Sometimes I think about the time that guy in the pickup truck spit on me, or the confrontation with the police while I was house hunting. A few weeks ago, I was sitting on a curb in my embarrassingly sprawling neighborhood and someone in a truck drove by, stopped maybe 40 yards away, backed up and stared at me for five or six seconds, then left. “What was that about? What could it have been about?”
My son is 12, all arms and legs. Studies tell me that when he walks down the street, he’ll be more likely mistaken for 16. His 12-year old movements will be threatening. I know: I’ve already had that conversation with teachers.
Yesterday, I sat in my car with him and we talked about what’s going on, and this is neither the first nor second such conversation. He doesn’t quite believe what’s happening, but he believes it more every time we have this conversation. I know he’ll believe it more the next time we are here, the next time someone utters a racial epithet around him. This is a reality I went through, and I know it’s a reality he’ll go through.
My thoughts nowadays are more about him. He’s one candy bar away from “Gun!” and being shot. He’s a moment away from “He should have complied” and “He was no saint” and whatever else they would say. It wouldn’t be true, not this boy who interrupts my meetings to hug me and ask me if he can have apple juice, but I know it would be said.
Of course, I think about other things. In so many ways, my life is great… and I have a lot to do, so I go back to the business of getting through my life and resigning myself to the fact that I really do have to do my taxes this weekend. But the thoughts always come back.
You know what I’m thinking now? As I write this, I’m sitting in my office and I’m looking out at my city. I can see the campus, I can see midtown and downtown, buildings poking out above all the many trees. But I don’t see smoke. I don’t see broken windows. I don’t see all the stories out there. I know that right over there two college kids from Spelman and Morehouse were dragged from their car and tased during the demonstrations this weekend, and I’m sure there are other stories, and some of them probably ended even worse. I know most of them were never recorded, never noted by the public.
I don’t see your story either, but I know you have one. We all do. That’s mostly what I think about at times like these. Everyone has a story. I may not see yours any more than you see mine, but I know you have one.
In the end, it’s what binds us together. We all have stories and as often as not they are similar in some important way. It’s how we know we are human together.
And when they are different? Well, that’s even more important. Those differences also tell us about each other, even when they are so different that they seem hard to imagine.
Either way, these stories make us the community we are. It is, simply, fundamentally true. And when we realize it, we can change things. It really doesn’t have to be the way it’s always been. We can make it better as a community. In fact, we must.
Look, it’s been a long few weeks, and a very long weekend. Please, stay safe. I’d like to hear you tell your story one day.
Peace.

Don't just adopt opinions, develop them.
PetTrack Lets Owners Know Exactly Where Their Dog Is
The pandemic gave people a lot more time with their dogs and cats, but the return to the office has disrupted that connection for many. Pet cameras can help but are needed in every room and don’t really tell owners what their furry friend has been up to without reviewing all footage.
Now, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have created a new device that can put pet owners at ease.
PetTrack uses a combination of sensors to give the accurate, real-time indoor location of an animal. Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio wireless sensors locate the pet and accelerometers determine if it’s sitting or moving regardless of objects or walls in the way, giving owners more detail on what their pet is doing than a camera or GPS.
All of this is located on a small sensor that can be put on a collar for minimal invasiveness and can be viewed via a compatible smartphone app.
“PetTrack comprises two things: one is knowing the pet’s indoor location and second is trying to understand their activity,” said Ashutosh Dhekne, an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science (SCS).
Dhekne and his students presented the research in the paper PetTrack: Tracking Pet Location and Activity Indoors at BodySys 2022 in July, a workshop on body-centric computing systems that was part of MobiSys 2022 in Portland, Oregon.
How PetTrack Works
PetTrack’s innovative combination of sensors makes it unique compared to other pet-monitoring devices. The UWB radio wireless signal locates where the pet is in the home from up to 100 feet away, while the accelerometer acts as an inertial sensor that can track the pet’s pose. This means owners can learn whether their pet is standing, sitting, or even lying down.
Unlike with cameras, owners can always know where their pet is because the UWB network is accessible through walls, furniture, doors, or anything else a cat or dog can hide behind. The UWB network is plug-and-play and doesn’t interfere with existing WiFi but should be connected to a home WiFi network to give the owner smartphone updates.

Location data takes up far less bandwidth than images and doesn’t burden the owner’s WiFi. Multiple UWB sensors and a central anchor data collection module help determine the location via multilateration, or individual distance measurements from different anchors, keeping it accurate.
“Together, combining where the pet is and what the orientation of the pet is, we can create a summary map of where the pet has been during the day and what activity the pet was doing,” Dhekne said.
This could reassure owners who are concerned about pets getting into forbidden places or comfort owners worried about their sick or elderly animals.
PetTrack Privacy
Privacy is another major advantage of PetTrack. Just like a router, PetTrack has at least one central anchor device in the home or backyard, making it less invasive than a camera in every room. It also doesn’t take up the entire room because the device is small enough to hide behind a lampshade.
One set of anchor devices can track up to four pets with updates every second. PetTrack functions even when only a few anchor devices are reachable, albeit with lower location accuracy.
PetTrack’s local focus also keeps it safer. Whereas hackers can take over cameras and compromise privacy for owners, PetTrack’s network only functions in the area it’s in. This means it doesn’t have the same vulnerabilities cameras do such as enabling a hacker to watch owners or locate expensive objects or valuables in the house.
PetTrack’s Future Possibilities
Currently PetTrack is designed just to monitor an animal’s location and position, but it has a lot of potential. Pet daycares could use the technology, so owners have a sense of how their dog is doing away from home. It could also become a training tool where a buzzer could sound if a pet were in an area they were not meant to be.
PetTrack could not only be the future of animal-monitoring technology but could provide a whole new way for owners to connect with their dogs or cats.
“Overall, the idea is to connect better with your pet, using PetTrack,” Dhekne said. “You could detect changing pet behaviors and interact with the pet using location-aware robotic toys.”
Other researchers think PetTrack could improve the pet training process. Neeraj Alavala, the lead SCS master’s student on the project, shared the feedback other researches provided at BodySys.
“One good piece of feedback that we got was that we could use our existing setup to also track when pets make accidents in the house during potty training,” Alavala said. “We already have the technology to track when and where these accidents happen and can ensure that those areas get cleaned up. As an extension, we can also give the pet feedback like a buzzer to train the pet to not go in the house.”
Whatever its applications, PetTrack could make the bond people have with their pets even stronger.

Ph.D. Student Developing Trust, Peace of Mind With Smart Webcam Cover
Don’t worry, no one is watching you.
After all, you remembered to put your webcam cover back on after your Zoom meeting, right?
If you forgot to do that, it’s still unlikely someone is watching you through your webcam. But if you want that sense of security, a new device may be able to provide it without you having to do anything.
A “smart” webcam cover designed by Interactive Computing doctoral student Youngwook Do can cover your webcam automatically after you’ve used it for a virtual meeting.
Do’s webcam cover detects when the LED indicator, which informs the user the camera is recording, is on or off. The eye of the cover fits directly over the lens of the webcam and is made of polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) film. PDLC is a type of “smart” film that keeps light out and images opaque until an electrical stimulus is applied.
When users turn their webcams on, Do’s cover supplies that stimulus to allow light through to produce a clear image. Users are then prompted to manually press a button to open the cover. When the LED indicator is off, the cover removes the stimulus, the lens becomes opaque once again, and the cover closes.
Do’s paper, Smart Webcam Cover: Exploring the Design of an Intelligent Webcam Cover to Improve Usability and Trust, cites a Hewlett-Packard survey that found 59 percent of Americans cover their webcams to avoid the threat of surveillance. And in a survey of 200 webcam cover users, Do found that 62 percent occasionally forget to re-attach their webcam covers after using their webcam.
There are no reliable statistics, however, that explain how frequently hackers tap into the webcams of computer devices. All that’s known is that it has happened, and it could happen to anyone.
But the fact that so many people take measures to protect themselves, even without documented data that shows how often webcam surveillance occurs, was not lost on Do as he conducted his research. Do attributes that behavior to the human need to feel safe and assured that no one is watching.
“There are no statistical results on it, but the more important problem is the user’s perception,” Do said. “Once people saw these incidents happening, they started distrusting whatever the manufacturer claimed about it being secure, and that’s why they started using a physical cover because you can simply make sure no one can watch you.”
Do said he designed his webcam cover with a “trust factor” in mind. He not only wants people to be safe when they are using ubiquitous technology like webcams — he wants them to understand how they’re being protected.
Do believes the more people understand the technology that protects their security and privacy, the safer they feel, and the more initiative they take toward educating and protecting themselves.
“I think that’s the beauty of designing better interactions instead of better security,” he said. “There are secure ways to protect end users from malicious activity, but if people cannot find it useable, it becomes useless. People are the weakest link for security and privacy, so it’s important to help them learn how this is working and how to use security and privacy in the right way to protect themselves.”
Do said there is one barrier to his webcam cover prototype: It runs on a battery and must be removed from the webcam to be recharged. He said there are a couple of methods he is considering to solve the problem.
One would be an interaction-powered device that can keep the battery charged through the energy created by a user typing on the keyboard. Another potential method would harvest energy from the radio waves of a local Wi-Fi network. Do said this method is convenient because any potential hacker could not take remote control of a webcam without the computer being connected to Wi-Fi. If there is no Wi-Fi, there’s no reason to worry about the webcam.
Do said he is also exploring security and privacy in other ubiquitous technologies such as smart speakers. People who own smart speakers like Amazon Alexa devices may fear what they are saying is being listened to or recorded without their knowledge or consent.
As of now, people must be reliant on the word of the device’s manufacturer that their privacy is not being invaded. That’s where a third-party device, such as the one Do has developed for webcams, can bridge the trust gaps between device and user.
“A lot of security and privacy designs have a discrepancy between actual privacy and security and perceived privacy and security,” he said. “People cannot see, people cannot feel, people cannot touch or hear it, so there’s no easy way for them to understand whether it’s working. My research tries to narrow the gap between actual privacy and security and this perceived privacy and security.”
Ph.D. Student Looks Back on 10 Years at Georgia Tech
By the time Weiyu Liu walks across the stage Dec. 16 at Bobby Dodd Stadium to receive his doctorate diploma, he will have spent nearly one-third of his life at Georgia Tech. He’ll leave with two degrees and 10 years of memories.
Liu left his home country of China to attend Georgia Tech as an undergrad and spent five years earning his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering before spending another five working toward a Ph.D. in robotics.
Working under the advisement of School of Interactive Computing associate professor Sonia Chernova, director of the Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning (RAIL) lab, Liu knew he would have the autonomy to make his research his own.
“We have amazing, top-tier researchers,” Liu said. “I think opportunity is the word to use to describe the research here. We’re not bound by trends. Our researchers have developed their own themes. The research is very diverse. We can collaborate with external researchers and develop our own research.”
Liu has been interested in robotics since he was a kid, entering several robotics competitions during high school. As he started his post-grad research, he narrowed his focus to studying robotic autonomy.
“The question that drives my research is how do we develop autonomous robots that can operate in human environments? One core idea that my research is based on is leveraging semantic knowledge,” he said. “Humans use semantic memory to store knowledge of the world, including facts about objects, actions, and relations. This knowledge helps us use language productively to plan and reason and solve problems creatively. So, we wonder if robots can also use semantic knowledge to better accomplish tasks in the real world.”
Robots are becoming more effective at performing specific tasks that are well-defined, such as picking up a mug. However, getting a robot to perform more general tasks specified in natural languages, such as “set the table,” is much more complicated.
“In this case, the robot must understand various geometric and semantic concepts associated with a correct table setting, like how to position the cutleries with respect to the plate and how to order the cutleries based on their sizes and functions,” he said. “More importantly, the robot needs to be able to apply these general concepts to the specific objects in front of the robot and manipulate the objects to create that structure in the physical world.”
In addition to his own research, Liu was part of a team from the RAIL lab that developed a robot system that could perform navigation, pick and place, and machinery operation in a structured environment without human intervention for 45 minutes.The robot was named the winner of the 2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation’ FetchIt! Mobile Manipulation Challenge. As a result, the RAIL lab received a mobile manipulation robot from Fetch Robotics worth $100,000.
Liu said winning the competition was one of his favorite memories from his time at Georgia Tech.
He added that he also has fond memories of his internships as a Ph.D. student. Liu completed two internships at the Nvidia AI Robotics Research Lab in Seattle and is still collaborating with researchers there. After graduating, he will begin a two-year post-doc at Stanford University, his next step toward pursuing a career of researching robotics in higher education.
“Robotics is a growing field,” Liu said. “The interdisciplinary robotic program at Georgia Tech has given me the opportunity to learn knowledge from different fields and then integrate them into my own research. I’ve learned a lot from all the classes and all the other researchers I’ve worked with on this journey. I feel excited to continue my robotics research.”
Ph.D. Student to Receive Outstanding Student Award at UbiComp 2021
School of Interactive Computing Ph.D. student Nivedita Arora will be awarded the Gaetano Borriello Outstanding Student Award this week at the annual UbiComp conference, taking place virtually alongside the 2021 International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC).
Based upon a vote by a five-person committee, the award is given to a student who has made outstanding research and service contributions to the field of ubiquitous computing.
Arora, who is advised by former Georgia Tech Professor Gregory Abowd and current Georgia Tech Professor Thad Starner, focuses her work on re-imagining the future of mobile and ubiquitous computing by embracing an alternative view of computing where physical surfaces become computational material that can self-sustain itself to sense, compute, actuate, and communicate with users.
Past work has introduced innovations in self-sustaining touch interfaces, examined challenges of self-sustaining sound and vibration sensing material, and more.
“These projects are meant to inspire multidisciplinary, out-of-the-box thinking for a new direction for computing, the Internet of Materials, where computing is woven into the very fabric of our lives,” Arora said of her work in a dissertation research statement.
Georgia Tech student Hyeokhyen Kwon was also a finalist for the Gaetano Boriello Outstanding Student Award. Co-advised by Abowd and Associate Professor Thomas Ploetz, his primary research interests lie in developing artificial intelligence systems to serve human wellbeing. Past work has investigated human activity recognition through video and on-body accelerometry.
The award will be presented to Arora at the conference’s awards ceremony on Sept. 24.

Ph.D. Student Taking Action to Expand Minority Recruitment
Organizing a workshop or becoming a mentor can have an incredible impact on individuals and on the research community.
For Alexander Rodriguez, a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), these initiatives have led him down the path to meeting his advisor and helping future researchers to have greater opportunities.
Rodriguez has organized several workshops over the years with an emphasis on broadening minority student participation in data mining research. Recently, he was invited to a panel as part of exploreCSR 2021 that aims to encourage minority recruitment to graduate school.
“Many of these undergraduate students are talented and have the motivation to do the research and drive innovation, but may not have resources needed to take off, including advice or roles models from their community. Organizing initiatives such as this give us an opportunity to disseminate resources, let these types of students know about opportunities, and motivate them to take the challenge,” he said.
Rodriguez’s motivation to become involved with mentorship and workshop activities began with a chance encounter that led to him attending the annual Broadening Participation in Data Mining Program.
“It was by chance. My friend posted about this conference in a Facebook group and I applied. I received the scholarship to attend the workshop co-held with the KDD conference in San Francisco. It was an amazing opportunity for me because I was able to meet a lot of researchers. It was also my first experience in data mining,” said Rodriguez who helped to organize the epiDAMIK workshop held this summer.
The following year, in 2019, Rodriguez decided to help organize the conference. This decision would ultimately change the course of his research career trajectory and introduce him to his advisor CSE Associate Professor B. Aditya Prakash.
Now, the research duo is well-known in the computational epidemiological research field and has led several high-profile research efforts that focus on forecasting Covid-19.

“For me, this was something that opened doors to other opportunities, and I believe more people should have an experience like this,” he said.
Helping to provide these experiences, Rodriguez recently mentored students from Peru on a research project with Prakash through the REPU Program. The program builds pathways for Peruvian students to pursue STEM degrees and research opportunities.
“I want to help as much as I can,” Rodriguez said. "It’s important because it’s a way for us to help not only students on an individual level but also build communities where those students can become mentors to future generations as well. This is a way to cement these opportunities and motivation.”
For those looking to get involved in mentorship, Rodriguez advises students first to approach the work by having a willingness to help others. He adds that it’s important to view mentorship as a symbiotic research relationship.
“In my case, I was happy to help these undergraduate students. It was exciting because they are excited about these projects, and it was beneficial for me because I learned about how to guide others,” said Rodriguez.
“If you are thinking about becoming a professor or becoming a leader in industry, this is a valuable skill to have as you grow in your career. Of course, it takes time, but the outcome makes it all worthwhile.”
PITAS Puts Physical Communication at the Center of Technology
Tingyu Cheng, a Ph.D. student in the School of Interactive Computing, hasn’t seen his family since right before the Covid-19 pandemic began. Cheng is from the Shenyang, Liaoning province in China, but he has been living and studying in the U.S. since 2011.
Zoom calls allowed him to communicate with his parents and let them know he was okay, but something was missing. The virtual connection just wasn’t enough. But the problem went beyond missing the physical presence of his parents. He had limited contact with his friends as well.
That’s how Cheng, who has specialized in developing smart materials in the field of human-computer interaction throughout his post-graduate career, came up with the idea for PITAS — an elastic, dual-layered thin-sheet material that can locally or remotely convey physical information such as shape, color, temperature, and texture.
Each of these types of physical information can be translated into how a person is feeling at any given moment. A change in shape, for instance, may mean someone is feeling well, while a change in color could mean someone is feeling lonely.
“We were trying to develop a new type of material that can deliver physical information to users either in the same location or across multiple locations,” Cheng said. “We were largely motivated by the lack of physical touch during the pandemic. We were on Zoom all the time, but we did not have the physical contact that we had in our normal daily lives. We wanted to have a smart material system to bridge that gap to let people use our system to deliver different types of information.”
PITAS was named a finalist in Fast Company’s 2022 Innovation by Design Awards and will also receive international recognition at the Prototypes for Humanity (formerly known as the Global Grad Show), Nov. 16-17, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
Cheng describes PITAS as an input/output robotic sheet. Each sheet has a top and a bottom layer. The top layer is the actuating layer and is made of silicone and ethanol, and it responds to changes in pressure or temperature made to the bottom layer, which is composed of silicone and conductive carbon nanotubes.
Cheng said by adding an increase in temperature to the bottom layer through a power supply, the ethanol expands and causes the top layer to change shape.
“When ethanol starts to heat up, it changes phase from liquid to gas, but it’s encapsulated inside the silicone material and cannot escape,” he said. “That’s how it causes the shape change.”
When the temperature is reduced back to normal, the sheet flattens out to its original state.
To get the top surface to change color, Cheng inserts a thermochromic pigment that will change from one color to another at a certain temperature
There is as much craft as there is science surrounding PITAS. Users can cut the sheets into whatever shape they desire, whether through manual cutting with scissors or through a more advanced approach such as laser cutting and 3D printing.
“Most soft smart materials are really hard to control and difficult for novice users to use,” Cheng said. “We are the first smart material system that allows users to easily customize into different shapes.”
This allows for the possibility to create 3D objects, such as plants or flowers for home décor.
Cheng created two artificial roses that can connect to each other through WIFI. Two people could each have one of the roses and be in different locations across the world but could still use the roses to communicate with each other.
When one person touches the leaf of the rose, causing it to change from green to yellow, the same leaf on the other rose will also change from green to yellow. This could be used as a signal for them to communicate to each other how they are feeling — whether they are depressed or lonely.
“When you see a flower blossom, that’s normally positive information,” Cheng said. “When you see the leaves turning green or a vivid color like yellow, and they’re shrinking in size because lack of water, that’s more negative information.”
Cheng said PITAS could be mass produced at low cost and sold at an affordable price.
“We envision that users can store this material at home,” he said. “We want to develop a very affordable and accessible system. That’s another driving force.”
Cheng and his collaborators are exploring other methods of communication through PITAS such as building a physical task management system for an office environment. An array of Post-it Notes with PITAS sheets attached to the backs could be used for an employee to communicate to their supervisor when a task is completed. The employee touches a Post-it Note, causing it to change shape along with the one it is remotely connected to at the desk of the supervisor.
“That’s something we’re still investigating,” Cheng said. “We’ve gotten a lot of positive feedback in our user study for this project. They think it’s useful and different. When it comes to task management, everything is digital, but all our users agree it’s nice to have some physicality in certain scenarios.”
While isolation has reduced since the pandemic began, Cheng’s journey on the PITAS project has allowed him to realize the need for the conveyance of physical information in the digital age. And if a lockdown does happen again, PITAS can help people be more prepared to get through the isolation.
“I think that’s a lesson this pandemic has taught us,” he said. “Digital information may not be enough in many ways, especially to bring users closer. We will keep pushing the boundaries of this project to make it more reliable and more realistic so users can bring in this physical information.”
Power of People Recognized at College, Institute Awards Ceremonies
College of Computing Dean Charles Isbell has a saying that summarizes everything anyone needs to know about the College: “Our strength is, and always will be, our people.”
To recognize its meritorious people from the 2022-2023 academic year, the unit hosted its 32nd Annual College of Computing Awards luncheon on April 20.
Between the luncheon and other award presentations elsewhere at Georgia Tech, the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) exemplified Isbell’s words, showing that people make all the difference when it comes to leading technological research.
This was most evident through School of CSE Assistant Professor Srijan Kumar, who took the James D. Lester III Endowment Award, which is one of the most prestigious College awards and presented for noteworthy research in internet phenomena.
The Lester Award was an exclamatory end to a monumental year for Kumar. The award presentation comes just a month after Kumar received an National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award and the National Academy of Science named him a Kavli Fellow for the second time in back-to-back years.
Kumar is just as much a caring mentor and educator as he is an accomplished researcher. In September 2022, he received a Georgia Tech Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) Thank-a-Teacher award for his CSE 6240 course in web search and text mining.
Kumar was not the only School of CSE person recognized at the College’s award luncheon. Fellow CSE students, faculty, and staff that received awards included:
- Ph.D. student Ruijia Wang- Outstanding Graduate Head Teaching Assistant Award
- Ph.D. student Agam Shah- Rising Star Doctoral Research Award
- Alumnus Nilaksh Das (M.S. CSE 2017, Ph.D. CSE 2022)- Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award
- M.S. student Alex Yang- Donald V. Jackson Fellowship Award
- M.S. student Yingchen (Eric) Ma- Marshall D. Williamson Fellowship Award
- Qi Zeng, an undergraduate student advised by Assistant Professors Spencer Bryngelson and Florian Schäfer- Outstanding Undergraduate Research Award
- Pratham Meta, an undergraduate student in Associate Professor Polo Chau’s research group- Outstanding Second Year Leadership Award
- Professor Srinivas Aluru- Outstanding Faculty Leadership Award
- Postdoctoral Scholar Daniel Gibney- Outstanding Postdoctoral Research Award
- Robert Donaldson, a teaching assistant in Chau’s CSE 6242 Data and Visual Analytics class- Outstanding Instructional Associate Award
- Communications Officer Bryant Wine- Outstanding Staff Impact Award
The College of Computing awards luncheon was not the only venue on Georgia Tech’s campus where School of CSE people received awards and recognition this year.
Kevin Li, an undergraduate student in Chau’s research group, received the Provost’s Academic Excellence Award. Li also received the G.D. Jain Outstanding Senior in Biomedical Engineering Award.
With a number of students from his group earning awards, Chau was also recognized for his noble efforts this year leading and molding students.
Chau received the Senior Faculty Outstanding Undergraduate Research Mentor Award at Georgia Tech’s Faculty and Staff Honors Luncheon on April 21. The College of Computing also recognized Chau at its awards presentation for reaching ten years of service.
Another Institute award presented to CSE faculty was the Faculty Honors Class of 1940 W. Roane Beard Outstanding Teacher Award. Georgia Tech awarded this to Lecturer Max Mahdi Roozbahani.
School of CSE faculty also received awards off-campus from organizations closely aligned with relevant research fields.
The most recent and prominent of these was an Amazon Research Award, presented to School of CSE Assistant Professor Yunan Luo. This award will help Luo advance his research in computational biology and medicine, while also developing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications for use in other fields.
School of CSE Associate Professor Elizabeth Cherry was part of a research team that received the 2023 Georgia Clinical & Translational Science Alliance Award. School of Physics Professor Flavio Fenton, a CSE programs faculty member, led the group in research to better understand arrhythmias in human hearts.
C. David Sherrill, a Regents’ professor with joint appointments in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the School of CSE, received the 2023 Charles H. Herty Award. Awarded by the Georgia Section of the American Chemical Society, the Herty Award recognizes research, education, and service activities in the Southeast by a chemist.
While awards presentations commonly occur at the end of spring semester throughout Georgia Tech, numerous School of CSE students and faculty received notable awards earlier in the year.
Professor Srinivas Aluru joined Kumar as School of CSE faculty who received a CTL Thank-A-Teacher award in September 2022. Aluru received two of these awards for his CSE 4220 Introduction to High Performance Computing course.
A research team that included School of CSE faculty, students, and alumni were finalists for the Gordon Bell Prize, presented at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis in November 2022. These included Professor Rich Vuduc, Ph.D. student Vijay Thakkar, and alumni Ramakrishnan Kannan (Ph.D. CS 2016) and Piyush Sao (Ph.D. CSE 2018).
School of CSE faculty and students also received distinguished fellowships in 2022-2023 worthy of recognition.
In November 2022, School of CSE Assistant Professor Anqi Wu was recognized as a DARPA Riser. She followed this up in March 2023 receiving the Sloan Research Fellowship.
ML Ph.D. student Zijie (Jay) Wang also received a fellowship in March, the prestigious Apple Scholars in AI/ML PhD fellowship. Wang was one of only 22 young researchers from around the world to the receive the fellowship.
Last but certainly not least, School of CSE Ph.D. student Gaurav Verma received a Snap Research Fellowship in December 2022. Only 12 computer science students from around the world, including Verma, received this fellowship.
“It is an honor to celebrate the accomplishments this year by all our students, faculty, and staff. Our award recipients have much to be proud of,” said Haesun Park, School of CSE Regents’ Professor and chair. “We are privileged to have so many esteemed colleagues, students, and staff in our School.”
Professor Deploying Anti-plagiarism Detection Tool on 900-student Course
Interactive Computing professor Thad Starner is teaching one of the largest courses ever taught at the College of Computing. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CS3600) has 911 students taking the course for Spring 2023.
To manage a class that size, Starner is using nine classrooms and 18 teaching assistants to livestream his lectures.
But the biggest concern he has for the course isn’t logistics — it’s the difficulty of tracking plagiarism.
According to a study conducted by Plagiarism.org, 38 percent of college undergraduates said they committed plagiarism at least once. Starner said the first time he tracked plagiarism in his masters-level AI course, he found a rate of 7 percent, which means he can expect at least 60 students from CS3600 to cheat at some point this semester.
Starner added that if a professor takes preventative measures, such as giving a plagiarism exam, the rate is cut in half.
But Starner is going beyond that. He’s created AI-driven anti-plagiarism software that can automatically detect when students are colluding or sharing answers and when students are trying to outsource their homework to freelancers over the internet.
“This is the first time we’ll be able to use our anti-plagiarism tool on a class this size at the undergraduate level,” Starner said. “We want to make students aware that we’re doing it to take away the impetus to cheat and give the system a good test.”
Starner said the idea for his anti-plagiarism tool began when he taught Artificial Intelligence (CS6601) as part of the Online Masters of Science Computer Science in 2016. A professor from Portugal, who at the time freelanced as an online tutor, contacted Starner to make him aware one of Starner’s students tried to hire him to complete a take-home exam.
“The idea that someone would actually hire a consultant to do their take-home exam for them is so far beyond what I would consider to be normal cheating,” Starner said.
“During Covid, suddenly a lot of things were take-home. My courses were all take-home exams and assignments that last two weeks. We really need to make sure we maintain the integrity of the program. So, we started to look to see if we could have automatic tools that could identify when people were sharing answers on exams or assignments and could help us figure out when people are searching for freelancers to do their work for them.”
In the Fall 2022 semester, Starner used a new tool on a live class for the first time when he taught Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing (CS4605), which had an enrollment of slightly more than 100 students.
“The system works,” Starner said. “We went after the most egregious cases — people we believe shared information on both the midterm and final. What we found out is that all the ones we went after admitted to it.”
For any assignment or exam that involves writing code, the tool can automatically list and compare one student’s code to another and look for the codes that are most similar.
“When you have a thousand students, you can compare every student to every other student and get some sort of metric of how close their code is,” Starner said. “You look for the ones that are way too similar. Our automatic tools help us focus our attention to the cases that are most interesting.”
For CS3600, Starner hopes that his new tool sends the message that cheaters will be caught and encourages anyone who would have cheated to drop the course.
Inevitably, Starner knows his tool won’t eliminate every instance of plagiarism. That’s why he added an additional feature that will help automate the process of working with the Office of Student Integrity to prosecute cases. The tool can automatically gather evidence and send its findings to OSI, reducing a process that would normally take days or weeks into minutes.
“That’s a lot of burden on the professor to push those through, but once students know you’re doing this, they realize it’s much easier to learn the material than it is to cheat,” he said. “The number of cases goes down if the effort goes down, but you still have enough cases that it’s going to take a lot of time. We’ve got to really make that convenient for professors to do.”
Starner said he’s already started integrating his anti-plagiarism tool with Canvas, the web-based learning management system the Institute uses to create and manage online courses.
“We want to make it so that anybody who has a Canvas quiz, you can click a button, and it will immediately give you the most similar exams that have the highest probability of plagiarism.”
In addition to the anti-plagiarism tool, Starner said he has a group of teaching assistants for CS3600 dedicated to monitoring plagiarism.
The message is clear.
“Don’t cheat,” Starner said. “We’re trying to make it so that it’s just as hard to cheat and not get caught as it is to do the work in the first place, so just do the work in the first place.”
Professor Says Community Recognition is “Cherry on Top” of a Rewarding Career
Georgia Tech School of Computer Science Professor Moinuddin Qureshi was recently named the winner of the 2022 ACM SIGARCH Maurice Wilkes Award.
The annual award, which includes a $2,500 cash prize, is one of the most prestigious mid-career awards in computer architecture and recognizes contributions to the community. Qureshi earned this year’s distinction for work he’s done to advance high- performance memory systems since earning his Ph.D. in 2007.
“This is a wonderful and much deserved honor - my heartiest congratulations,” said Babak Falsafi, EPFL computer science professor and SIGARCH chair.
The announcement was made during an award luncheon during ISCA'22: The 49th International Symposium on Computer Architecture, which was held in New York City this summer.
“Research is a very rewarding profession. When you solve a difficult problem, the kick that you get is completely unlike any other. When your ideas get adopted, the satisfaction you get is unlike any other.
“And if the community recognizes the work, that’s the cherry on top,” said Qureshi during remarks at the event.
The award is named after Maurice V. Wilkes, a British computer scientist and a Turing Award winner. Wilkes is widely considered as the father of microprogramming and played a pivotal role in the electronic delay storage automatic calculator, which started operating in 1949.
Qureshi's research has impacted many design aspects of high-performance memory systems according to School of Computer Science Chair Vivek Sarkar.
“Moin's selection for this award clearly demonstrates the leadership impact of his research career thus far and reflects positively on both his accomplishments and on Georgia Tech.
“His highly cited publications have become household names in the computer architecture community and continue to have a major impact on subsequent research and product development,” said Sarkar, who is also the Stephen Fleming Chair for Telecommunications in the College of Computing.
[RELATED: Professor Wins Intel Outstanding Researcher Award]
Sarkar points to two facets of high-performance memory systems design– caches and non-volatile memory (NVM) – as examples of Qureshi’s lasting contributions to the field.
He took a new approach to the design and configuration of memory caches by introducing novel policies. These policies placed larger caches at the outermost level of the cache hierarchy relative to smaller caches placed at the innermost level. This new approach ultimately influenced how cache architectures for 3D memory systems are developed.
Qureshi’s work has also influenced the evolution of NVM and the design of future hybrid memory systems. His research demonstrated that phase-change memory can be combined with standard dynamic random-access memory to create a hybrid system that delivers the benefits of both memory types. This breakthrough allowed for cost-effective and power-efficient increases in memory capacity.
“We are all proud of this achievement and can already see signs of influential impact of his more recent research in computer architecture, including in the field of quantum computing,” said Sarkar.
Qureshi, who holds nearly two dozen patents, began his career as a research staff member at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, where he developed the caching algorithms for Power-7 processors.
He earned best paper award in 2018 at IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture,. Qureshi won a 2019 Persistent Impact Prize for his ISCA 2009 paper on phase-change memory and 2021 Persistent Impact Prize for his MICRO 2009 paper on PCM wear leveling, both recognized for “exceptional impact on the fields of study related to non-volatile memories.”
Along with his research, Qureshi is contributing to the field by developing the next generation of researchers, with several of his Ph.D. students placed at top academic places, including at UIUC, University of Wisconsin, University of British Columbia, and University of Toronto.
He is the director of the Memory Systems Lab, which designs and develops future computing systems. Current work in the lab focuses on quantum computing, secure hardware, and robust artificial intelligence.
Professor Says We Need to Teach People How to Read Online
As more of the world moves online, the internet has become a space for sharing knowledge and building community – but also for spreading disinformation and attacking people. How can we build and manage online communities to maximize the former and minimize the latter?
Amy Bruckman, Regents’ Professor of Interactive Computing, addresses that question in her new book, Should you Trust Wikipedia?: Online Communities and the Construction of Knowledge. The answer to the question in the title, by the way, is that “it depends on the page.”
“The interesting thing about Wikipedia is that 1,000 people, checking each other’s work, can do a good job creating knowledge,” Bruckman said. But many pages only have a few authors and are not nearly as reliable. The process is analogous to the peer review that academic articles go through, except that the peers aren’t other experts but the general public.
“The problem is giving people enough information so they can decide on their own what to believe,” Bruckman said. “One of the things we have to do is teach people how to read online.”
The social peer review process works even less well for social media platforms, often for financial reasons.
“The thing that surprised me most about this book is that I kept writing about business procedures,” Bruckman said. For example, she said, Facebook didn’t hire a large staff of moderators for its Myanmar operations, because Myanmar isn’t, relatively speaking, a big market for the company.
When the nation’s military started a hate campaign against the Rohingya people on the platform, Facebook was understaffed, underprepared, and allowed those posts to spread. In the end, 24,000 Rohingya were murdered and another 700,000 fled the country.
“But people who complain about Facebook should realize that their critiques apply to all social media platforms,” Bruckman said.
Bruckman said that she has seen some progress recently, specifically around the war in Ukraine. Facebook won’t share Russian state news, for example, and Reddit has shut down pro-Russia subreddits.
“I think there’s a consensus reaction to Ukraine,” she said. “And the seriousness of the situation in Ukraine is focusing them on things they should have been working on the whole time.”
Bruckman believes that social media should be regulated, although she also says it will be hard and that there are “pitfalls on all sides.” In the end, it may be that corporations are too influenced by the profit motive to be good guardians of social media.
“I argue our whole system is broken,” she said, “and that it’s not fixable unless social media moves to nonprofit platforms. Funding nonprofit media with specific values could go a long way.”
Professor to Use NSF CAREER Award to Advance Open-World Computer Vision
School of Interactive Computing assistant professor Zsolt Kira believes the future of machine learning and computer vision exists in continuous open-world learning.
The National Science Foundation seems to agree.
Kira’s research received a boost in January when he learned he had received an NSF CAREER Award for his proposal, Visual Learning in an Open and Continual World.
“The goal is to move beyond current machine learning and computer vision where there is a closed-world assumption,” Kira said.
According to the National Science Foundation website, the NSF CAREER Award is given to early career faculty who show potential to serve as academic role models and advance the mission of their organization. The award is the most prestigious one given by the NSF to early career faculty.
Kira said in closed-world computer vision, a human annotates every piece of data into a fixed set of categories that a machine learning model uses to function. Eventually, the machine will encounter a new scenario or object that humans didn’t anticipate.
“Self-driving cars, once you deploy them, inevitably they’ll encounter new types of data such as new objects,” Kira said. “The idea is how can we detect if it’s seeing something new? Once we detect it, how can we add it to the knowledge that the AI model has and be able to automatically and continuously update it to learn new classifiers and object detectors?
“An open world means that if the car encounters some completely new thing, it should be able to handle that new type of object that it might encounter.”
Kira is an associate director of the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech and branch chief of the Machine Learning and Analytics group at the Georgia Tech Research Institute. The NSF CAREER Award, which is worth more than $500,000, will allow Kira and his students to create more robust open-world machine learning models over the next five years.
In the first year of his five-year proposal, Kira will focus on untangling different types of distribution shifts in out-of-distribution detection from current machine learning models. Out-of-distribution detection happens when the model detects an entity outside of its training data.
In the second year, he’ll use natural language processing to help his models detect and label new entities.
“There’s a lot of buzz about these language models or multimodal models that tie language and vision together,” Kira said. “So, we’re leveraging those advances so that after it detects something new, it will automatically be able to label it.”
In the third and fourth years, Kira will refine the semantics and build a hierarchal structure for his new models to help them become more continuous in their learning. In the final year, he hopes to have models ready for generation and deployment.
Kira said his work will advance AI education through Meta’s AI Learning Alliance, an initiative to increase diversity and equity in the field of artificial intelligence. Kira’s work will also expand into K-12 education initiatives through Georgia Tech’s Constellations Center for Equity in Computing.
“It’s a great honor to get it, and it’ll drive a lot of great work,” Kira said of receiving the award. “The foundations of the proposal were built from the work of my students. Most credit goes to them for doing great work in my lab. I think this proposal really ties together a lot of their work to really try to revolutionize computer vision where it can really be in an open world.”
Professor Using 'Minikers' to Harvest Energy Through Everyday Activities
Whether through simple motions such as opening a door or through strenuous activities such as a 10-mile morning run, human beings create energy every day. Josiah Hester, associate professor and director of the Ka Moamoa Lab at Georgia Tech, believes that energy, which most people aren’t aware is around them, could be an untapped resource.
What if opening the door to a basement nine times could produce enough energy for the door to open itself on the tenth time when someone has their hands full? Automatic doors have been invaluable in providing convenience for those who have difficulty opening doors, but the problem with them, and other automated objects, is they are powered by complex wiring systems or batteries with short lifespans. These systems are expensive, waste energy when not in use, and require constant maintenance and battery replacement, Hester said.
Working with Yang Zhang, assistant professor in electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, Hester said he’s starting to lay the groundwork toward solving the problem of the inefficiency of automatic systems through devices called Minikers.
The energy produced by many people manually opening a door to a public building would be more than enough to power the automatic function when the need for the door to be automatically opened arises, he said. And instead of a battery, the door would be operated by a Miniker, which contains a custom driver circuit that enables motor mechanisms to switch between manual and automatic operation, and a capacitor for energy storage.
“You pull the door open, which makes the motor turn, and then we convert the motion of the motor into electrical energy, which we can store for later.” Hester said. “It’s momentarily stored in these capacitors, which are two small metal plates that hold a charge between them. Unlike a battery, there is no chemical reaction, or protective circuitry, so they can be charged and discharged virtually infinitely.”
Hester and Zhang recently received a $550,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to fund research and development of Minikers and other interaction-powered devices. These devices could potentially revolutionize the smart home environment and make smart home technology more cost effective and energy efficient. Hester co-authored a paper on the subject, “Minikers: Interaction-Powered Smart Environment Automation,” which was an official selection at the 2022 Ubicomp conference held at Georgia Tech in September.
“You’re not going to be able to power the refrigerator, unfortunately, but keeping a light on for many days, that’s totally feasible,” Hester said. “You could have a door connected to a light outside, and every time you opened it, the light comes on. It’s not a lot, but it’s enough to do some tasks that can be helpful in the smart home context.”
Through his Ka Moamoa Lab, Hester focuses on ubiquitous and wearable technology that is eco-friendly, environmentally sustainable, and is either battery-free or greatly reduces the need for a battery.
Harvesting the energy that humans produce every day through daily activities can only go so far, and once that energy is stored in a Miniker, it quickly begins to dissipate.
“If I imagine the amount of energy I can store in a cellphone battery to be an elephant, then the amount of energy I can store in a capacitor is like an ant,” Hester said. “How do I do useful things when I expect elephant-level energy storage but end up with ant-level energy storage?”
Hester said his work focuses on bridging this gap by “making computing and sensing more energy-efficient, energy-aware, and contextual.”
In the same manner as Minikers, Hester believes wearable technology such as a smart watch or Fitbit, could temporarily operate through the motion of the person wearing these devices.
“When a wearer is moving and active, that is often when they want to collect FitBit type of data,” Hester said.
“Having a device that harvests energy from your body motion could let you track important health metrics like blood pressure and heart rate and never have to worry about plugging the wearable into the wall to charge. Every five steps you might generate enough energy to get one heart rate reading, which might be enough to be useful.”
It may not seem like much, but every time a device can use an alternate source of energy besides a battery or power grid, it’s good for the environment, saves money in the long run, and allows the device to last longer, Hester said.
Hester knows his work is just the tip of the iceberg, and there are many problems that still need to be solved to make Minikers an efficient and trustworthy alternate source of power. The next thing he wants to tackle is to determine whether an individual Miniker needs to be designed to fit a specific function, or if there can be a one-size-fits all version.
“It’s a design challenge,” Hester said. “You have different ways you want to harvest energy and you have different activities you want to do. How are you going to situate it all together? That’s why it’s fun. It’s more creative than mathematical.”
Professor Wins Amazon Research Award
Qirun Zhang has won an Amazon Research Award for programming languages research. The one-year award contract provides unrestricted funds and Amazon Web Services credits for customer-driven research.
“I am excited to receive the award,” said Zhang, an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science (SCS). “As a programming languages researcher, I enjoy what I do and believe it is important to continue working on fundamental problems to improve software reliability.”
He will use the award for interleaved Dyck-reachability research, which makes program analysis simpler and more efficient by eliminating ineffective parts of the graph. This funding will lead to practical tools that can analyze real-world software and foster collaboration with Amazon automated reasoning researchers.
This work has been widely recognized by the research community. Zhang and his students won a 2020 distinguished paper award at Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), an online conference, for this work. His student, Yuanbo Li, also received a Facebook Fellowship for related research in May.
“Qirun is a world-class leader in programming languages,” SCS Chair Vivek Sarkar said. “It is great to see him receive this opportunity to increase the industrial impact of his research.”
Professors Seek to Provide Fact-checkers with New Tool to Identify Misinformation
Professional factcheckers will soon be armed with a new tool to help them combat the false information that tends to spread across social media platforms.
Course Correct is a tool that helps journalists and fact checkers identify misinformation online by using a computational approach. The tool removes much of the time-consuming manual labor associated with fact checking.
College of Computing faculty members Srijan Kumar and Munmun De Choudhury are working with researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s School of Journalism and Mass Communication to develop the new tool.
With the sheer volume of misinformation that exists online, there aren’t enough fact checkers to go around, and the process of finding where the misinformation originated and strategically countering it with correct information is lengthy.
“We want to create a system that can identify misinformation that is already trending, falsehoods that will trend in the future, and also what is emerging because you want to nip them in the bud,” said Kumar, an assistant professor with the School of Computational Science and Engineering.
After receiving $750,000 from the National Science Foundation’s Convergence Accelerator program for a phase one award, the team of researchers got the greenlight in September for phase two and an additional $5 million from the NSF.
Kumar and De Choudhury received $200,000 of the phase one funding to examine how misinformation is fact checked and study the obstacles that prevent accurate and efficient correction while earning public trust. Now they are receiving $1.35 million of the phase two $5 million in funding to build Course Correct and test it in the real world.
Using algorithms that help quickly identify trending misinformation, De Choudhury said fact checkers will be able to do their jobs with confidence, which is essential given how much impact that misinformation regarding issues like elections and the Covid-19 pandemic can have on society.
“One of the takeaways from phase one of this award is that we need to empower the fact checkers better, and that empowerment can come through technology and computational approaches,” said De Choudhury, an associate professor in the School of Interactive Computing. “If we can somehow automate the process of detecting what could potentially be misinformation, that information could be passed on to the fact checker to use their expert judgment for the next step.”
Kumar said the team interviewed a pool of professional fact checkers about the biggest hurdles they face.
“The goal of this project was to understand, ‘What are the pain points of these professional fact checkers who essentially form the first line of defense against misinformation?’” he said. “We found that some of the biggest pain points for them are how to identify misinformation in real time and how to effectively deliver corrections.”
Identifying misinformation is just the first step. Time is of the essence, and fact checkers need a tool that will help them slow the spread of misinformation and minimize the damage.
“Speed is also an important one here, which is that it’s not just a lot of information, but it spreads fast,” De Choudhury said. “Oftentimes, misinformation is written in a way to overly sensationalize things and to create feelings of anger, hatred, or trauma. Those things spread even more quickly than credible information online.”
One way to keep up the pace is to have a system that identifies social media accounts that frequently fuel and spread misinformation as well as the innumerable accounts that consume and regurgitate it.
“Which actors are spreading this misinformation? Who are the ones consuming it? We want to create a taxonomy of the different types of consumers of misinformation and the spreaders of the misinformation and so on, so that fact checkers can take appropriate measures,” Kumar said.
But Kumar added that it can often be challenging to identify frequent perpetrators because many of them are aware of the existing artificial intelligence tools and avoid them.
Kumar and De Choudhury said they are looking at a tool that can universally work across all social media platforms, but the first version of Course Correct will specifically focus on Twitter. De Choudhury said they will have to be adaptable with the first version since Twitter recently underwent a change in ownership. Within a week of Elon Musk assuming ownership of the platform, a conspiracy theory regarding Paul Pelosi, the husband of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, spread unchecked through conservative circles after Paul Pelosi was attacked in his home.
“After the acquisition of Twitter, Elon Musk is already making sweeping changes to the platform, ranging from letting top executives go to proposing the formation of a content moderation council.” De Choudhury said. “Course Correct will likely have to navigate around these complexities, including what posts it gets to evaluation for false information as well as how this could be communicated to journalists to intervene.”
The targeted completion for the first version is September 2024, just before the next presidential election. De Choudhury said the team is looking forward to the real-world testing between now and then, which will inform how the algorithms within course correct can be improved and identify what are the strengths of the algorithms and what are the strengths of the humans performing the fact checks.
“I think just for reflection, it might be useful for us to see what are the types of misinformation that these algorithms and computational techniques are better at detecting versus others, and how does that complement what fact checkers can do so that we can think about future collaborative systems where the AI and the human are working together and they’re each drawing from their own expertise,” she said.
Program Bringing School Districts Together to Help Expand CS Education Access
During this week's national Computer Science Education Week (CSEdWeek), Georgia Tech’s Constellations Center for Equity in Computing is introducing a peer mentoring program that will connect several school districts in Georgia.
Constellations fellow Sababu Barashango has created a computer science (CS) implementation workshop that is taking place Dec. 8. The Georgia Department of Education is collaborating with Constellations to facilitate the workshop.
During the workshop, school districts with existing CS programs will be paired with newly recruited school districts to help overcome some of the initial obstacles of creating district CS equity teams. Constellations is working closely with the Georgia Department of Education to help expand the reach of CS education.
“Diversity, equity, and inclusion are at the root of this district implementation plan - building community among the school systems in Georgia and making sure schools have the support to carry out SB 108,” Barashango said.
Senate Bill 108 is a bill passed in 2019 that requires all Georgia school districts to make computing part of their K- 12 school curriculum by the 2024-2025 school year. Each school year there are different markers the bill requires each of these school districts to hit. Constellations’ goal is to help them prepare.
“The Constellations Center for Equity in Computing is part of the Institute's answer to this timely challenge to meet the requirements of state legislation and more broadly, to meet the demands of the changing demographics and economy in the region and nation,” said Kamau Bobb, Constellations senior director.
The mentorship program is just one-way Constellations is working to support SB 108.
District implementation workshops are held quarterly each year. They cover a wide array of topics that are important to the progression of CS education in the state.
Teachers or districts interested in participating in these workshops can find more information here.
Program Building Cultural Competency in CS Education with New NSF Grant
The Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech will train teachers to help students from underrepresented groups connect to computing as part of a $10 million, five-year grant from the National Science Foundation.
Most interventions in K-12 computing education have focused on the deficits in students’ knowledge, according to Lien Diaz, director of educational innovation and leadership for Constellations. But that focus often overlooks the extent to which students are coming into the classroom with different cultural experiences and expectations.
“We have to change our beliefs about girls and students of color coming into computing classes,” Diaz said. “We need to show them that computing connects to their interests, whether that be arts, the law, medicine, or something else. And that requires elevating the teachers.”
Georgia Tech is receiving $300,000 from the larger NSF grant, which will go to creating development activities for computer science (CS) teachers. The synchronous and asynchronous training materials will focus on cultural competency within CS education.
Teachers who complete the training will have the opportunity to become Computing Equity Coaches for Constellations. The program will begin this year with 10-15 coaches who will support other teachers as they learn new techniques for student engagement.
The larger grant is for the Alliance for Identity-Inclusive Computing Education, which is headquartered at Duke University. The grant number is 2118453.
Python Fundamentals Seminar Helping OMSCS Students Prepare for Success
As computer science (CS) majors know, Python is currently one of the most used programming languages. Of course, this hasn’t always been the case. Prior generations of CS students cut their teeth on Java, C, and other, now less studied languages.
To help those that earned their bachelor’s degree before Python became the standard, Georgia Tech opened Computing in Python I: Fundamentals and Procedural Programming (CS 1301) to students enrolled in the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program as a non-credit seminar this semester.
David Joyner teaches the online CS 1301 course. He is the executive director of online education & OMSCS at Georgia Tech’s College of Computing. He is also the author of a new book about online education, Teaching at Scale: Improving Access, Outcomes, and Impact Through Digital Instruction.
One of Joyner’s key themes in the book is looking beyond challenges to find unexpected opportunities in large-scale online learning environments. Opening his Python fundamentals course – recently ranked as among the Top 10 Best Courses to Take for 2022 – to help bridge any knowledge gaps for OMSCS students is an example of Joyner’s point.
“We get a lot of OMSCS applicants who have succeeded in college-level CS courses and qualify for the program, but that could use a stronger foundation in Python to succeed. The seminar provides that foundation in a more structured, social format,” said Joyner.
Fifty OMSCS students from around the world are participating in the Python fundamentals seminar this semester. They join more than 450 other students enrolled in the online, asynchronous course. These include:
- On-campus students
- Honors program students
- Dual enrollment high school students
- Georgia Tech Europe students
- Georgia Tech Oxford students
In all, the 510 or so students range in age from 16 to 68 years old and represent 42 countries. Joyner says the greatest benefit of having so many different students participating is that they benefit from one another's experience.
“Our OMSCS students have always been fantastic about helping one another in their classes; now, they're helping our undergraduate students as well,” said Joyner, who is also an adjunct faculty member in the School of Computing Instruction.
With such a diverse group, an undergraduate student might ask a question and get an answer from an experienced software developer that enrolled in the seminar to add Python to her resume. Or, as Joyner describes, a student visiting the help desk could meet a professional in the field at a company that might be hiring.
“In online education in general, we want to provide more environments for students to interact, especially when they represent such a diverse set of backgrounds, but interaction requires an anchor to get started. This course, in many ways, is that anchor,” said Joyner.
Teaching at Scale follows last year’s publication of Joyner’s book, The Distributed Classroom, which he co-authored with College of Computing Dean Charles Isbell.
Quiz Bowl Team Wins Nationals
Every year, Georgia Tech’s academic quiz bowl team competes in two national tournaments. This year, their top team won first among 51 of the best teams in the country in the Academic Competition Federation's Nationals Tournament.
In some ways, quiz bowl is similar to Jeopardy!. Topics range from fine arts to sciences. Rather than competing as individuals, though, teams of four compete together.
“People are often put into bins by majors, but their other interests are reflected by the questions,” said S.A. Shenoy, a computer science major and member of the winning team (as well as a former Jeopardy! contestant).
Quiz bowl participants must learn about a wider range of topics and fields than what they learn in their coursework. Any source of knowledge could prove crucial to a win — one participant knew an answer from a conversation they had with someone about music. That kind of community has helped many Tech students find a home in this club that goes beyond the buzzer.
Aside from the joy of winning, there is a more meaningful reason this win was so special to the team.
“Robert Meredith was a professor at Tech. He popularized quiz bowl in the Southeast, and the trophy we won is named in his honor,” said Hari Parameswaran, president of the club and an electrical and computer engineering major, and another Jeopardy! alum. Meredith kept the spirit of quiz bowl alive, and this was the first time since 1996 that a Georgia Tech team was able to bring home the trophy.
Above all, the club is a place in which people can feel safe learning with their peers.
“We never put winning above well-being, because it is important to cultivate positive mindsets,” said Rodrigo Rose, an aerospace engineering major. The club wants to win, but that never outweighs the need for everyone to feel included and accepted.
Academic quiz bowl is always seeking new members. The club meets every Monday and Thursday, and everyone is welcome, even if they do not want to compete. There are many ways to be involved, including volunteering, competing, and planning tournaments.
Raising Money is Sexy, But Pindrop CEO Says Customer Satisfaction Key to Success
Vijay Balasubramaniyan (MS CS 08, Ph.D. 11) got the idea for his business when his phone rang in the middle of the night.
He was a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student at a conference in India, and he had just bought a suit locally. The 3 a.m. call was from his bank back in the U.S. The person on the other end of the line asked for Balasubramaniyan’s Social Security number to prove his identity and make sure the purchase wasn’t a fraud.
Balasubramaniyan declined. After all, the call itself could have been a fraud, a trick to get his Social Security number for criminal purposes. Stalemate: neither party could prove their identity to the satisfaction of the other. The purchase was canceled and Balasubramanian never did get his suit.
“Phone calls have existed since Alexander Graham Bell, and we still have no way of proving the identity of a caller,” Balasubramaniyan remembers realizing. And suddenly, he knew what his dissertation topic would be.
[RELATED: Georgia Tech Spinoff Secures Silicon Valley Funding for Phone Security Technology]
Today, Balasubramaniyan is the CEO of his own company, Pindrop Security, which analyzes more than a billion calls every year for the purpose of detecting fraud. Pindrop serves eight of the top 10 U.S. banks, and five of the top seven life insurance companies, among a number of other Fortune 500 companies.
He credits his time at Georgia Tech for his success.
“Not every idea is a great one,” Balasubramaniyan said. “At Georgia Tech, you’re asked to dig deep and come up with a good idea. My peers and the Georgia Tech alumni I have hired think deeply.”
Learning to Phoneprint
When Balasubramaniyan and his advisor, School of Computer Science Professor Mustaque Ahamed, began to look at identifying phone calls, they realized quickly that a single call can pass through many different kinds of networks — cellular, VoIP, landlines.
“The only thing that is there through the whole process is the audio itself,” Balasubramaniyan said. His research showed, however, that the audio itself contained clues.
He created a technology called Phoneprinting, which analyzes more than 1300 features of a phone call to create a distinctive profile of the caller. Once he could “fingerprint” phones, he could match them to their users.
After he presented at his first conference, NPR and Popular Science published stories about his work.
“After that, banks started calling me,” Balasubramaniyan said. “They wanted to license the technology.” At that point, his research started to look a lot more like a budding business.
From Research to Start-Up
Pindrop Security got its start right here on Georgia Tech’s campus, in office space provided by the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), the campus start-up incubator, and with advice from VentureLab, an Institute program that provides legal guidance for startups.
Pindrop got its first funding through prizes and grants — from the Technology Association of Georgia, from the Georgia Research Alliance, and from the National Science Foundation. The company would go on to raise $200 million from investors, but Balasubramaniyan said he would advise anyone to put their product ahead of their fundraising in the early days of a company.
“When you’re starting a company, what seems sexiest is raising money,” he said. “But if you want to have a really meaningful company, you have to start with an obsession for customer satisfaction. If you have customers who want your product, the money will follow.”
With Recent Funding, Sea Level Sensor Project in Savannah Moves into New Phase
The rising sea levels along Georgia’s Savannah coast and an uptick in more severe storms during hurricane season are bellwethers to looming ecological challenges stemming from climate change.
Ongoing research to study sea level rise led by Georgia Tech researchers, a coalition of universities, Savannah and Chatham County government leaders, and local community groups is creating what could be a national model for coastal regions across the country facing similar challenges.
Launched in 2018 with a Georgia Smart Communities Challenge Grant, the data collected from the sea level sensors is used to inform city and county planners and emergency responders on resource deployment following major weather events.
The project, now referred to as the Coastal Equity and Resilience Hub, in its fourth year, is now slated to receive $5 million from Congress to expand the network of sensors — currently 50 are deployed off Chatham County’s coast — to blanket Georgia’s 11-county coastal region.
“With this new earmark, we are recognizing a new phase of our project which has evolved,” said Kim Cobb, director of Georgia Tech’s Global Change Program and a professor who studies climate, oceanography, and weather in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.
Cobb and Russell J. Clark, senior research scientist in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech’s College of Computing, co-lead the project. Allen Hyde, assistant professor in the School of History and Sociology in Georgia Tech’s Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, leads a National Science Foundation project focused on youth disaster resilience as part of the effort.
The funding will support expansion of building out more hyperlocal flood forecasting models, resilience planning tools for underserved communities, and further development of a K-12 education curriculum, paid internships, and other workforce development programs.
Georgia Tech and its partners in the Coastal Equity and Resilience Hub — which includes Savannah State University, the University of Georgia, and the University of South Carolina — is using these low-cost sensors to gain real-time data that over time will help inform the policies on infrastructure design and retrofitting, Cobb said. It will also further expand first responders and emergency planners’ ability to forecast extreme rainfall and storm surge events on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood specific basis.
“It's going to translate into a saved lives and saved infrastructure,” Cobb said.
A National Model
Hub researchers say the data being collected from the sensors and additional information gleaned from the sensor expansion has immediate applications in terms of flood disasters and hurricanes. Those findings over the long-term could also help frame the national dialogue and help inform policy as leaders in Washington shape it to tackle rising sea levels and climate change.
The award is part of a broader federal push, including a $12 billion funding package, to help Georgia and other states along the Eastern Seaboard, as well as the West and Gulf coasts, develop resiliency and flooding plans and protocols to mitigate damage from future floods.
Cobb said this new funding allows the Hub to further efforts in its research that further expands education and workforce development — particularly in underserved minority communities — as components of the broader strategy.
“Our project started out anchored on the sensors and trying to provide real-time data to emergency planners and emergency response responders, but it’s no longer just a small team of people who are interested in sensors or physical scientists, engineers and researchers on the science and technology side,” she said, explaining the research team of some 30 people also includes policy and planning experts, along with community advocates.
“We're trying to think about solutions in the context of history, geography, — the history of people, cultures, and economies down on the coast,” Cobb said. “There’s no waving a magic wand and making this all right, especially for the most vulnerable communities.”
Community Voice
In broad terms, the project touches flooding, infrastructure, property, and pollution. But this newer phase brings in aspects that go beyond scientific modeling of risk, said Dean Hardy, an assistant professor in the University of South Carolina’s Department of Geography.
It’s what he calls the “human dimension” phase.
“There are disaster plans, there's resiliency plans, and there's community level thinking. But what we need is systemic change,” said Hardy, whose research expertise is in geography and integrative conservation, which marries preservation and social and community goals with public policy.
“So, what I hope partially comes out of this is not just a bunch of scientific publications or better scientific understanding of these issues, but capacity-building with community organizations that leads to the capacity for self-determination.”
That acknowledgement is important to marginalized communities," said Dawud Shabaka, interim director of Harambee House, in Savannah. The organization, which is involved in the sensor project, promotes and advocates for civic engagement and environmental justice from the coastal city’s Black residents and youth.
Shabaka noted that the engagement component, particularly local high school and middle school students working on the sensors and coding, has allowed the participants to see themselves not only as budding scientists, but as future community leaders.
“When you’re dealing with or managing or mitigating an issue that’s affecting society, it’s got to involve research and dialogue with the community. This project is allowing us to recognize that the community themselves are the subject matter experts,” said Shabaka. “Having the students involved at an early age, benefits society as a whole and lets them know that the work they’re doing is having a much wider impact. This is the type of community engagement that needs to happen to make people feel like they’re worthwhile.”
Regents' Professor Named ACM Fellow
The Association for Computing Machinery has named School of Interactive Computing Regents’ Professor John Stasko as one of its 57 new ACM Fellows.
The ACM Fellows program recognizes the top 1 percent of ACM members for their contributions in the fields of cybersecurity, human-computer interaction, and mobile computing, among others. It also highlights a career of outstanding accomplishments and service to these fields. All ACM fellows must be nominated by other fellows and be reviewed by a distinguished committee of their peers to receive the accolade.
Since 1989, Stasko has made significant advancements in the fields of data and information visualization and human-computer interaction.
“I’ve done work spanning a spectrum from creating new techniques, building systems, evaluating techniques in systems, but also some fundamental and theoretical conceptual work,” Stasko said.
Stasko pioneered SunBurst, a groundbreaking technique that introduced ways to present hierarchal information structures, allowing people to understand and access the data within them. He also garnered universal acclaim for his 2007 paper on the role of interaction in visualization, which has more than 1,100 citations in Google Scholar. His work on the Jigsaw project for visualizing large document collections earned him the Visualization Technical Achievement Award in 2012.
The ACM Fellows program was initiated in 1993, four years after Stasko joined the College of Computing. He was nominated by IC Professor and Fleming Chair Emeritus James Foley, who is also an ACM Fellow.
“Jim has been an amazing mentor for all my career, so I really appreciated that,” Stasko said. “He’d been pushing me for many years to be nominated. I am greatly appreciative of all my Ph.D. students over the years as well. They are a big part of this honor.”
Stasko is in a more exclusive club of honors because he now holds fellowships from both the ACM and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. He was named an IEEE Fellow in 2014.
“For computer scientists, there’s two primary parent academic organizations that host the vast majority of our conferences and journals,” he said. “One is ACM, and the other is IEEE. It just depends on what your areas of research are if you end up doing a little more of one over the other. My research has really crossed into the conferences and journals of both of those areas, so that’s a nice honor to have both recognized.”
According to a press release, the ACM recognized Stasko for his contributions to the design, analysis, usage, and evaluation of software and information visualization.
Stasko was also inducted into the ACM CHI Academy in 2016 and the IEEE VIS Academy in 2019. Over his career, he’s had about 18 papers accepted into the annual ACM CHI conference and 30 accepted into IEEE VIS. In 2013, he served as General Chair of the IEEE-VIS conference when it was hosted in Atlanta.
Stasko received his B.S. degree in Mathematics from Bucknell University in 1983 and holds master’s and doctorate degrees from Brown University.
Research Finds Models Used to Detect Malicious Users on Popular Social Sites are Vulnerable to Attack
Whether they are fake accounts, sock puppet accounts, spammers, fake news spreaders, vandal editors, or fraudsters, malicious users pose serious challenges to the security of nearly every virtual platform.
Now, research led by Georgia Tech has identified a new threat to deep learning models used to detect malicious users on Facebook and other popular e-commerce, social media, and web platforms.
“Social media and web platforms put a lot of energy, effort, and resources into creating state-of-the-art methods to keep their platforms safe," said Srijan Kumar, School of Computational Science and Engineering assistant professor and co-investigator.
"To do this, they create machine learning and artificial intelligence models that essentially try to identify and separate malicious and at-risk users from the benign users.”
Using a newly developed adversarial attack model, the research team was able to reduce the performance of classification models used to distinguish between benign and malicious users.
The new attack model generates text posts that mimic a personalized writing style and that are inflected by contextual knowledge of a given target site. The generated posts also are informed by the historical use of a target site and recent topics of interest.
Known as PETGEN, the work represents the first time researchers have successfully conducted adversarial attacks on deep user sequence classification models.
“There is always this game between the models trying to catch the malicious users and the accounts trying to not get caught. If we can act as attackers, we can identify the model vulnerabilities and the potential ways these malicious accounts evade detection systems,” Kumar said.
The research was conducted on two real-world datasets from Yelp and Wikipedia. Although the PETGEN research reveals that malicious users can evade these types of detection models, Kumar says he and his team are working now to develop a defense against this type of attack.
“The findings will help to pave the path toward the next generation of adversary-aware sequence classification models and better safety for virtual interactions on these platforms,” Kumar said.
The findings of this work were first presented at the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining by Kumar, School of Computer Science Professor Mustaque Ahamad, and computer science Ph.D. student Bing He.
The work presented in PETGEN is also an output of a Facebook research award that Kumar received jointly with CSE Associate Professor Polo Chau.
Research to Help Neurodiverse People, Others Leads the Way at Social Computing Conference
Faculty and students from the School of Interactive Computing are working to benefit the lives of underserved groups and communities such as autistic employees and visually impaired social media users.
That’s just two examples of the Georgia Tech-led research presented at the 25th Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW), which wraps up today. In all, 19 papers authored or co-authored authored by Georgia Tech faculty and students were presented at the virtual conference, which focuses on technologies impacting groups, organizations, communities, and networks.
Jennifer Kim, an assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing, is researching how technology can make the work environment more inclusive of neurodiverse people, while Stanley Cantrell, a Ph.D. student advised by Interactive Computing and School of Psychology professor Bruce Walker, is exploring how Facebook can be more accessible to the visually impaired.
Kim’s paper, The Workplace Playbook VR, is based on a study she conducted in South Korea with researchers from Seoul National University and Hanyang University. The study looks at how virtual reality can foster a more inclusive environment for neurodiverse employees.
Kim and her team designed a virtual reality program that provides data to families of neurodiverse workers to give them an idea of what they may be struggling with in the workplace.
“Families of autistic individuals can’t go to the workplace with them, so they really didn’t know what struggles they were going through, but by seeing how they do with the virtual reality and the available data, this made an opportunity for parents and therapists to understand this individual and have more empathetic communication with them,” Kim said.
But the study took an unexpected turn when the researchers began showing the VR program to the coworkers of the neurodiverse employees.
“What we didn’t expect was this case of being able to use this virtual reality for neurotypical coworkers,” Kim said. “(The neurodiverse individuals) liked that sharing this data can open up a conversation about how they are different from their neurotypical co-workers and how those neurotypical coworkers should change their behaviors to better interact with neurodiverse people.”
Kim said that adding the goal of modifying the behavior of coworkers helped the paper stand apart from previous research projects.
“We shouldn’t just focus on neurodiverse people,” she said. “There are a lot of technologies for neurodiverse people, but there isn’t much research on how we can change behaviors of neurotypical people to better interact and understand the perspective of neurodiverse people.”
Kim said the companies studied in her research have already reported a noticed difference in how much more comfortable neurodiverse employees feel in their work environments.
“Managers have told us it’s going to be really helpful for new neurotypical employees to better understand what neurodiverse employees like and what are their behavioral characteristics so they can understand by their first day of work how to communicate with them and what to expect,” she said.
Redefining accessibility
Stanley Cantrell has a different definition of accessibility than what is normally understood. Accessibility features in social media sites like Facebook must go beyond simply allowing users who are visually impaired to functionally use the website. These users deserve an equitable experience that rivals that of their sighted counterparts.
“We know there are about 285 million people worldwide living with some form of visual impairment,” Cantrell said. “They want to do the same things that sighted individuals do on Facebook, but the technology doesn’t facilitate rich engagement for individuals living with disabilities like visual impairment.”
In his paper, Sonification of Emotion in Social Media: Affect and Accessibility in Facebook Reactions, Cantrell explores making Facebook Reactions more emotionally engaging for visually impaired users. Working with Walker, who is the director of the Sonification Lab at Georgia Tech, Cantrell and his collaborators produced 48 different sounds that can be associated with Facebook Reactions, such as Like, Love, Sad, and Angry.
Cantrell has always had an interest in universal design, also known as inclusive design, but it blossomed during his internship with Facebook. He said although Facebook currently meets basic accessibility standards, he wanted to reimagine the experience for visually impaired users.
“Facebook’s screen reader accommodations check the box of making this accessible, but does it make it rich and engaging and delightful? What ways can we use sound to transform this visual information, but also in a way that’s engaging and doesn’t disrupt the experience,” he said.
Cantrell recruited 75 participants for his study, including 11 visually impaired subjects, to evaluate each of the 48 sonifications that he and his collaborators designed.
“Before we could begin designing sonifications, we had to first understand how sighted people interpret each Facebook Reaction,” he said. “Sometimes Reactions can have different meanings based on the context.
“We did some legwork prior to the study to see the different ways that Facebook Reactions could be used. For example, we found that the Haha Reaction can be used to laugh at something funny, or it can be used to bully someone.”
Looking beyond the scope of his paper, Cantrell said he hopes to make sound-enabled emojis a feature for text messaging, and he hopes it will be something that both sighted and visually impaired users can enjoy.
“We knew we didn’t want this to be just for blind people,” he said. “We wanted this to be an accessibility feature that could be useful to anyone.”
Research Paves Way for Home Robot that Can Tidy a House on Its Own
Struggling with keeping your home clean and organized? You may soon have an extra set of hands to help around the house.
Imagine a home robot that can keep a house tidy without being given any commands from its owner. Well, the next step in home robotics is here — at least virtually.
A group of doctoral and master’s students from Georgia Tech's School of Interactive Computing, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Toronto, believe they have created the benchmark for a home robot that can keep an entire house tidy.
In their paper, Housekeep: Tidying Virtual Households Using Commonsense Reasoning, Georgia Tech doctoral candidates Harsh Agrawal and Andrew Szot, master’s students Arun Ramachandran and Sriram Yenamandra, and Yash Kant, a former research visitor at Georgia Tech who is now a doctoral candidate at Toronto, set out to prove an embodied artificial intelligence (AI) could conduct simple housekeeping tasks without explicit instructions.
Using advanced natural language processing machine learning techniques, the students have successfully simulated the robot exploring a virtual household, identifying misplaced items, and putting them in their correct place.
Kant said most robots in embodied AI are given specific instructions for different functions, but the students wanted to be sure the robot could achieve task completion without instructions in simulation before moving on to real-world testing.
“In the actual world, things are difficult,” Kant said. “Training robots in the real world — they move around slowly; they will bump into things and people. So, we do it in simulation because you can run things at a faster speed, and you can have multiple virtual robots running.”
Dhruv Batra, an associate professor in the School of Interactive Computing and a research scientist with Meta AI, and Igor Gilitschenski, an assistant professor of mathematical and computational sciences at Toronto, served as advisors on the paper, which was accepted to the 2022 European Conference on Computer Vision, Oct. 23-27 in Tel Aviv, Israel.

In the virtual simulation, the robot spawned in a random section of the house and immediately began looking for misplaced objects. It correctly identified a misplaced lunchbox in a kid’s bedroom and moved it to the kitchen. It also located some toys left in the bathroom and moved them to the kid’s bedroom.
Agrawal said the goal of the project from the beginning was to have the robot mimic commonsense reasoning that any human would have in tidying a house. Through surveys, the team collected rearrangement preferences for 1,799 objects in 585 placements in 105 rooms.
“We collected human preferences data,” Agrawal said. “We asked people where they like to keep certain objects, and we wanted robots to have a similar notion of cleanliness in a tidy home.
“You don’t provide instructions when you ask the kids to clean up the house. It’s commonsense. You know certain things go in certain places. You know Lego blocks don’t belong in the bathroom. We thought it’d be cool if it could clean up the house without specifying instructions. As humans, we can do a bunch of these tasks without being given specific instructions.”
Creating the simulation had several challenges. These included getting the robot to use reason about the correct placement of new objects, getting the robot to adapt to new environments, and getting it to work through choices when there are multiple correct locations a misplaced object could go.
Szot said what attracted him to the project was the idea of creating a robot that didn’t need to be told where to put something, whereas in his previous work, that’s exactly what he had to do.
“If you wanted it do something like clean up the house, you would have to tell it, ‘Hey, robot, move that object to there,’” Szot said. “It’s very tedious to specify that. We took the first step of saying let’s give the robot some commonsense reasoning. It might not be specific to a person; it might just be capturing more generally what people think, but it captures a lot of important situations. It’s able to handle most of those situations in which people agree the object belongs there or the object doesn’t belong there.”
Using text from the internet, the team informed the AI that drives the robot by fine-tuning a large language model based on human preferences.
“The way we approached solving this problem is we took this external source of knowledge from text on the internet and these language tasks, and so from natural language processing we took that information and used it to give our robot some idea of this common sense,” Szot said. “It wasn’t purely from the house it learned how to do these things. From articles or texts online, it was able to distill this commonsense reasoning ability and then apply it.”
Kant said using language models allows the AI to distinguish between objects and whether those objects should go together. He added that he thinks that the language model used to train the AI can be fine-tuned by extracting content from web articles related to housekeeping.
“Language models have shown very promising results in trying to extract semantics, like whether two things — say an apple and fruit basket — go together in a household,” Kant said.
The team is just at the tip of the iceberg, and the virtual simulation serves only as a proof of concept. It’s a long-term project that will continue to explore new possibilities, which include creating a robot that can tidy a household according to specific user preferences.
But the successful use of NLP methods to inform a novel AI could break new barriers in the creation of new systems in which organization is the focus.
“It’s a benchmark for the rest of the community to use,” Szot said. “Hopefully this is something for people to gather behind to focus on this very realistic task setting of cleaning the house. We showed that you can create these embodied agents that can use this external knowledge and learn commonsense and use it in embodied robotic settings.”
“I think the data that we collected is pretty significant in the sense that we now have a few hundred annotations for where each object should go in houses and where they’re likely to be found in untidy houses, and I think that information can guide a lot of systems,” Agrawal added. “I feel like we are starting to now see people saying all these annotations can be used for building their own systems and benchmarks.”
Research on Reddit ID’s Opioid Addiction Self-Treatment Risks
Using advanced machine-learning techniques, Georgia Tech researchers have examined nearly 1.5 million Reddit posts to identify risks associated with several of the most common alternative treatments for opioid addiction.
These clinically untested, self-directed treatments are often developed and promoted through online communities like Reddit, which commonly encourage their use without professional medical consultation. According to the study, the three most commonly used are:
- Kratom – an unregulated herbal stimulant
- Imodium – a common anti-diarrheal medication
- Xanax – a psychiatric medication used to treat anxiety and panic disorders
The findings – part of what the researchers say is one of the first large-scale social media study of clinically unproven, alternative treatments (ATs) used in opioid addiction recovery – indicate that these treatments offer:
- Risky results
- Potentially substantial side effects
- High chance of abuse for those struggling with recovery
“Along with identifying what potentially are the most commonly used alternative treatments, we documented a number of important trends and gained valuable insights into how people use ATs, which will be used in part to better inform current treatment strategies,” said Stevie Chancellor, Georgia Tech College of Computing Ph.D. student and chief author of the study.
[PODCAST: Social Media's Role in Opioid Addiction Recovery with Stevie Chancellor]
One of the key trends documented among AT users is the growing use of “stacks” or “kits.” These combine several substances – prescription drugs, illicit drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins/minerals, or other substances – to combat withdrawal symptoms and facilitate recovery.
An anonymous Reddit post evaluated in the study read, “I’ve decided to quit [opioids] for good - what you guys think about my withdrawal strategy?” The post goes on to list what can reasonably be considered as a risky mix of anti-anxiety drugs, OTCs, alcohol, and more. Added to this, the study also found that many of these “stacks” have specific dosing patterns that users follow.
To identify these posts from among the initial dataset of 1.44 million posts from 63 subreddits, Chancellor and her colleagues developed a machine learning binary classifier. The classifier, which used a transfer learning approach to improve results as it scanned from one subreddit to the next, automatically labeled each post as either recovery or non-recovery related.

The research team – which included an addiction research scientist – applied natural language processing techniques to the resulting dataset of 93,104 recovery-related posts. Known as “word embeddings,” the process allows a system to find and learn contextual relationships between words and phrases in a large dataset. These relationships often reveal connections between words that may be misspelled or slang terms for common words.
The results were verified through a series of automated and human-in-the-loop validation tests of the machine learning algorithm.
“We found that Imodium, commonly used to relieve nausea and diarrhea, is often referred to as ‘lope’, which is short for the active ingredient Loperamide. We also confirm that it is prone to misuse and dependence,” said Chancellor.
It’s this kind of insight the Georgia Tech team wants to share with treatment and recovery researchers and care providers.
“Because there is little empirical research into alternative treatments for opioid use disorder, professionals overseeing detoxification and behavioral interventions are at a disadvantage,” said Munmun De Choudhury, School of Interactive Computing assistant professor and co-author of the research study.
“Broadly speaking, we’re interested in reducing the harm that can be caused by alternative treatments. We are moving in the right direction by identifying and giving some context to the most commonly used of these, which ultimately gives behavioral health clinicians more insight into how ATs impact their patients.”
Chancellor and De Choudhury’s work on this project was supported in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, #R01GM112697.
Complete details about the study are in a paper Discovering Alternative Treatments for Opioid Use Recovery Using Social Media, which has been accepted to the 2019 ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, set for May 4 through 9 in Glasgow, UK.
Researcher Looks to Future of Computing through Human Visual Cortex
Computers are often compared to the human brain. While computers can operate faster than the brain, the brain is exponentially more efficient. This is a key reason why the brain remains a source of inspiration for scientists.
One of these scientists is Nabil Imam, an assistant professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE). Not only does Imam study the possibilities of brain-inspired computing, he also thinks the answer to this engineering question lies in the same parts of the brain that let us see our world.
Imam posits that by modeling the human visual cortex in computer hardware and software, computers can become both more efficient and more powerful. If achieved, this idea could transform the future of computer manufacturing and programming.
Imam presented his research observations Feb. 3 at a summit hosted by Georgia Tech’s Center for Research in Novel Compute Hierarchies (CRNCH). Imam’s presentation included an overview of the neural circuits within the brain, simulations that have modeled the visual cortex, and designs for silicon chips that emulate brain architecture.
The highlight of Imam’s seminar was his presentation of a microchip architecture he and other researchers have designed to function like the brain’s visual cortex. The system Imam presented has simulated hundreds of millions of neurons and tens of billions of synapses, a step toward making brain-inspired computing a reality.
“Multi-chip systems have been built using these chips to simulate 100 million neurons and 25 billion synapses in real time,” Imam said. “These chips are very efficient platforms for simulating biological neural networks.”
To open his seminar, Imam showed circuit connectivity and neural response properties of the primary visual cortex – an area of the brain that is involved in seeing the world.
The primary visual cortex is one of the most extensively studied areas of the brain. It consists of six layers of brain cells totaling about 300 million neurons and 300 billion synapses in primates. Even though this is one of the most well studied areas of the brain, the sheer numbers and complexity involved still make it difficult to understand.
Imam then discussed computer simulations of the visual system during his presentation. The example Imam used simulates a visual cortex segment of 230,000 neurons, a small sliver of the structure but one that shows promise.
“This is a very small simulation, but it is a very detailed one. The models are based on extensive data curated from years of measurements,” said Imam. “With the right kind of computing platform, we can scale this up and simulate larger portions of the circuit and its interactions with other areas of the brain.”
Due to the sheer computing power required for brain simulations, scaling is a significant obstacle that researchers, like Imam, are studying to overcome.
Simulating one second of a small neural circuit requires hours of computing time. With current computer architectures, it would require speeds measured in exaflops and memory spanning petabytes to achieve a simulation of the human brain.
Presently, the max speed of the world’s fastest supercomputer, called Frontier, is 1.102 exaflops. It is the first, and currently, the only computer to reach exascale speeds. To do this, Frontier requires 7,300 square feet of space, consumes 21 megawatts of power, and pumps 6,000 gallons of water a minute to keep itself cool. This shows how far computers still must go before being able to simulate the brain.
However, progress is being made. The chip Imam discussed at CRNCH Summit 2023 uses specialized integrated circuits to model neurons and their networks found in the brain and visual cortex.
To address the scaling challenge, the computer chips were scaled up via multi-chip platforms to simulate hundreds of millions of neurons and tens of billions of synapses, approaching scales of complex cortical circuitry.
Simulations in this chip are orders of magnitude larger than the 230,000-neuron example simulation Imam presented earlier.
These chips operate in real time, so one second of brain activity equals one second of computing. These chips are also smaller than a square inch and consume less than one watt of power. The chips also can be integrated with sensors and actuators to interact with the environment.
Much of Imam’s research remains theoretical and ongoing work continues. But as Imam showed in his CRNCH Summit 2023 seminar, the intersection of computing and neuroscience is rapidly growing and the future for this technology appears bright.
“The goal is to develop computational and analytical methods that will help us understand the behavior of these models” Imam said. “These insights can then be used to develop new classes of computer systems and new models of computation.”
Researchers Discover Vulnerability in Widely-Used Method for Securing Phone Data
New research reveals that attackers can access encrypted data on low-end Android phones by detecting weak radio waves that are emitted by a phone’s processor.
The research is from a Georgia Tech team led in part by School of Computer Science Professor Milos Prvulovic. More details about the findings – released earlier this month at the 6th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy – are available in a story published by Georgia Tech Research Communications.
Researchers Envision the Future of User Interfaces in Road Vehicles
Georgia Tech is home to one of the leading research groups for user interfaces for on-road vehicles. The Sonification Lab’s driving and in-vehicle technologies have been a pillar of the group for more than a decade, and with the advent of electric and autonomous vehicles, the researchers are addressing new opportunities and challenges.
At the 13th International ACM Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications (AUTO-UI), Sept. 9-10 and Sept. 13-14, Georgia Tech researchers are co-leading the workshop To Customize or Not to Customize: Is That the Question?, focused on how user needs can be met when interacting with autonomous vehicles.
The workshop will explore defining the role of customization in UI, its range, and dissecting its taxonomy to build a more recognizable and comprehensive model for engineers and researchers.
“Participants will discuss what features of automotive UI's can be standardized and what should be customized, and work towards creating a taxonomy,” said Sidney Scott-Sharoni, Ph.D. student in Engineering Psychology and workshop co-organizer.
Workshop Organizers
AUTO-UI’s main program includes 151 researchers from 12 countries with work in the technical program. Germany leads with the most accepted papers and demos as well as contributing authors. Germany and the United States combined contribute to 69 percent of the main program.
Georgia Tech alum Myounghoon "Philart" Jeon (MS and Ph.D. in Engineering Psychology) of Virginia Tech is a co-author on five papers and demos, the most for any single author at AUTO-UI 2021.
Bruce Walker, the director of the Sonification Lab and professor in the School of Psychology and School of Interactive Computing, said his lab approaches in-vehicle technology research with many users in mind.
“Modern vehicles include many secondary 'non-driving related tasks,' ranging from adjusting the entertainment system to navigation, as well as occupants, unfortunately, checking their mobile devices,” said Walker. “While it is generally safest not to do secondary tasks while driving, carefully designed auditory user interfaces and accessories with multimodel displays can allow safer completion of many of these tasks.
“Multimodal displays also can serve as assistive technologies to help novice, tired, or angry drivers perform better, as well as helping drivers with special challenges, such as those who have had a traumatic brain injury or other disability.”
As autonomous vehicles become more common on the roads, there will be an even greater opportunity to let the car drive itself, allowing the occupants to sit back and focus on even more engaging non-driving tasks like reading a book, watching a movie, or even using a virtual reality system. Even still, passengers will need to keep an eye (or ear) on what's happening around the vehicle. Walker's research aims to support this advanced "situation awareness."
"It requires great trust in the technology to watch a movie while letting your car take care of the driving," Walker explained. "Each person expects and desires different behaviors from their automated vehicle. Our research into multimodal user interfaces, and this workshop at AUTO-UI on automation customization, is pushing towards this future where we can take back our commute."
Toyota is currently sponsoring the lab on research in the automotive UI space. Learn more about the Sonfication Lab at http://sonify.psych.gatech.edu/.
Researchers Examine Role of TAs in Computing Ethics
As more students enroll in computing ethics courses, the number of teaching assistants (TA) needed to support these classes is skyrocketing. And according to new research, students working as TAs in these courses need some extra support as well.
Led by Ellen Zegura, Georgia Tech computer science professor, the research group first started exploring issues relating to computing ethics teaching assistants (CETAs) through a grant from Responsible Computer Science, a funding program and community created by the Mozilla Foundation.
Teaching assistants play a major role in computer science courses, especially in those with larger class sizes, said Zegura, who is a Stephen Fleming Chair and Regents' Professor in the School of Computer Science. They also sometimes don’t receive the support needed in these roles. As enrollment in computing programs and computing ethics receives more focus, the number of CETAs has also increased.
She said the group, which includes researchers from Georgia State University (GSU), chose to focus on CETAs in their research because of the unique situations they experience in their positions. The subject matter of the course itself often poses complications for TAs in computer science ethics.
“In ethics, it’s interesting,” she said. “These TAs are also students and they’re also developing their own ethical thinking and understanding. Because of this, they might encounter a difficult or complicated ethical situation and not have a clear answer to give a student.”
Because of these challenges, the researchers thought CETAs would specifically benefit from additional support through a community of other CETAs.
To reach their goal of creating a sense of community support among CETAs, the research team decided to experiment with online communication platform, Discord, and created a communication channel that allowed CETAs from four universities across the country to discuss their ideas, resources, and struggles.
In their online group, the researchers created several discussion-based activities for the TAs in the online chat. One of these included an “Ask a Peer” session where the participants could ask for advice or opinions on an issue they were facing.
The study faced several challenges, including the participants not being as familiar with Discord as the researched had expected. One of their other findings was that the student participants did not have enough time to engage with the online community.
“Trying to support students is challenging because even if they need the support, they don’t always have the time to seek it out,” she said.
Even though they didn’t have much available time, Zegura said that most of the participants were enthusiastic at the prospect of an online community for CETAs.
“There was a lot of interest in understanding what was happening at other universities in ethics and being able to talk to and have this community of ethics TAs as a resource,” she said. “They felt that they would really benefit from additional support.”
After this study, Zegura said she is very interested in continuing research on TAs in the future, especially those for computing ethics courses.
“We feel that this is a relatively unstudied and underserved part of the education system. They’re so central to a lot of education, especially in computer science,” Zegura said.
The groups research was the focus of the paper Developing Community Support for Computing Ethics Teaching Assistants. The paper was co-authored by Zegura, Jason Borenstein, director of Graduate Research Ethics Programs in Georgia Tech’s School of Public Policy; Robert MacDonald, a graduate student studying human-computer interaction; GSU Professor Ben Rydal Shapiro; and University of California, Irvine master’s student Cass Zegura. Cass Zegura presented the paper at the SIGCSE 2023 Technical Symposium on March 16.
Along with the paper being accepted into and presented at SIGCSE, the group also authored a second paper, “Moment to Moment”: A View From the Front Lines with Computing Ethics Teaching Assistants. This paper focuses on a more in-depth analyses of interviews the researchers conducted with the CETAs and will be presented at the 2023 ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing (CHI) in April.
Researchers to Lead Paradigm Shift in Pandemic Prevention with NSF Grant
One lesson learned from the Covid-19 pandemic is that human behavior is a difficult variable to consider when predicting and preventing disease outbreaks. This challenge is magnified even more considering how different scientific fields conduct, interpret, and present research.
To overcome these challenges, Georgia Tech researchers form the core of an interdisciplinary, interorganizational team which seeks to prevent disease outbreaks by integrating the study of human behavior with computational data-driven models.
Calling themselves BEHIVE (BEHavioral Interaction and Viral Evolution), the group recently received a $1 million National Science Foundation (NSF) grant toward multidisciplinary team formation and novel outbreak prevention research.
“Our goal is to bring together all these terrific researchers from different disciplines to help bring a paradigm shift in the science of pandemic prediction and prevention,” said B. Aditya Prakash, associate professor with Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE).
“While epidemic forecasting is compared to weather forecasting, there is an important difference. Unlike weather, our actions and behavior can change the course of an epidemic.”
Prakash is the principal investigator of the $1 million NSF grant. Fellow BEHIVE members include:
- Pinar Keskinocak, William W. George Chair and Professor in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech
- Thomas Kingsley, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Biomedical Informatics at Mayo Clinic
- Shinobu Kitayama, Robert B. Zajonc Collegiate Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan
- Ramesh Raskar, Associate Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab
- Liliana Salvador, Assistant Professor at the University of Georgia’s Department of Infectious Diseases
- Joshua Weitz, Professor and Tom and Marie Patton Chair in the School of Biological Sciences and Co-Director of the Interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Quantitative Biosciences (QBioS) at Georgia Tech
Prakash emphasized BEHIVE’s primary goal to use its interdisciplinary organization to bridge research methodologies between hard and soft sciences.
He explained that human behavior was underutilized in epidemic science before Covid-19, largely due to data scarcity and underdeveloped computational technologies. Behavioral dynamics encountered during the pandemic, such as social distancing, mask wearing, and vaccine hesitancy, has provided new research and data that now can be considered in models and simulations.
Here, BEHIVE will develop high fidelity computational models by designing new artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques that bridge human behavior knowledge and traditional epidemiological theory and models.
“It is still an open question of how we can best incorporate human behavior knowledge into the study of pandemics. That is the challenge,” Prakash said. “Our main idea is to better integrate knowledge from psychology and the humanities into pandemic science using novel computational methods.”
BEHIVE originated when team members met through various workshops held in 2020 and 2021. Prakash was an invited organizer of the National Symposium on Predicting Emergence of Virulent Entities by Novel Technologies (PREVENT).
PREVENT reported that interdisciplinary collaboration was an obstacle in predicting and preventing pandemics. For example, some vocabularies often don’t mean the same thing across disciplines, so a consistent methodology to establish a common language must be developed.
BEHIVE is custom built to solve these challenges PREVENT revealed. Along with a wealth of knowledge learned through past epidemics, each BEHIVE researcher brings to the group experience working across interdisciplinary lines.
Among the Georgia Tech researchers alone, Keskinocak interfaced with policymakers and the public on measures to slow Covid-19 spread.
Prakash’s lab led several high-profile Covid-19 forecasting initiatives, including collaboration with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Weitz teamed with fellow Georgia Tech researchers with the College of Science, College of Computing, and the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering to create a predoctoral training program that integrates computational modeling and data analytics into bioscience.
Keskinocak, Prakash, and Weitz together are also faculty in the Institute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS), one of Georgia Tech’s ten interdisciplinary research institutes. IDEaS connects research centers and efforts in foundational areas such as machine learning, high-performance computing, and algorithms.
BEHIVE’s $1 million grant is funded through NSF’s Predictive Intelligence for Pandemic Prevention (PIPP) initiative. This program supports high-risk, high-payoff convergent research that aims to identify, model, predict, track, and mitigate the effects of future pandemics.
According to Prakash, the PREVENT symposium’s summary report also helped highlight the need for an initiative like PIPP.
PIPP is a two-phased initiative in which NSF funds 25 to 30 selected project teams, including BEHIVE, for eighteen months through phase one. However, this does not necessarily limit PIPP’s influence to chosen project teams within academia.
BEHIVE intends to partner with industry, governmental, and non-profit organizations to expand its interdisciplinary, interorganizational network.
BEHIVE’s nucleus of Georgia Tech researchers connects the group with the CDC, Georgia Department of Public Health, and numerous hospitals across the state. BEHIVE’s other researchers also serve in leading roles at non-profits, such as the Pathcheck Foundation, and top hospitals like the Mayo Clinic.
Along with developing interdisciplinary methodologies, new disease prevention models, and partnering with external organizations, BEHIVE hopes to develop educational training programs. This would ensure their effort last generations to bring about the necessary paradigm change to prevent future pandemics.
“Our initial projects and research the next eighteen months will help us get a sense of research gaps and enlarge our perspective” Prakash said. “We’re approaching PIPP as a science, and we want to lay the foundation of the science by bringing in many people from different fields for the future.”
Researchers Optimize HPC Software at Interdisciplinary Hackathon
High-performance computing is all about speed. One of the fastest ways for researchers to refine their projects is through hackathons where they have access to the latest HPC hardware, as well as support from their peers.
Georgia Tech hosted a virtual open hackathon held Jan. 18-26, for participants to advance and test ongoing software on powerful HPC hardware. On the final day, teams presented research showcasing insightful applications in physics, medicine, computer science, and more.
School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Assistant Professor Spencer Bryngelson coordinated the event with NVIDIA and the OpenACC Organization. This is the second hackathon Bryngelson has organized since arriving to Georgia Tech in 2021.
“Overall, this hackathon went really well once again,” Bryngelson said. “I am impressed with the presentations, and I hope that the teams leave satisfied with the progress made on their projects.”
Researchers from academia, national laboratories, and industry formed six teams in the event. Research scientists from NASA, NVIDIA, and Georgia Tech served as mentors to help teams through their projects and using available HPC hardware.
Georgia Tech researchers swarmed the hackathon with representation from nine schools spanning three colleges. These include: the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, School of CSE, School of Computer Science, School of Computing Instruction, the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, School of Physics, and the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering- an academic unit shared among Emory University, Georgia Tech, and Peking University.
One team participated in the hackathon to accelerate their software that simulates particle assembly, an area with application in geomechanics, materials science, and even pharmacology. At the end of the hackathon, the team accelerated their entire two-dimensional simulation algorithm by 78 times and by 29 times in a three-dimensional subprocess.
A second team used the hackathon to improve their Monte Carlo algorithm with applications in nuclear physics. Specifically, the group improved precision of tracking particle spins through electric and magnetic fields.
Another team also optimized a Monte Carlo simulation, but with application to better study and improve oxygen exchange between body tissue. Here, the team needed to accelerate their code to track over 2.5 million photons during propagation. By the end of the hackathon, their code’s speed improved by 20 times.
While all six teams saw refinement of their individual projects, the hackathon also presented an immediate and tangible environmental benefit for all.
Software optimization makes supercomputers more energy efficient. Teams preserved energy costs the equivalent of removing 50 vehicles from use for a year and planting over 3,800 tree saplings through improvements developed during the hackathon.
“This hackathon was absolutely worth it,” said Ruijia Wang, a Ph.D. student in Tech’s School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “It was a great learning experience and the potential application that we developed for our program is enormous.”
Teams ran their computer codes and programs on the latest HPC hardware available at Georgia Tech. The hackathon employed 81 total CPUs from Intel and AMD and 21 GPUs from NVIDIA, including the A100, A40, Tesla V100, and Quadro Pro models.
These CPUs and GPUs used in the hackathon belong to Georgia Tech’s Instructional Cluster Environment (ICE). ICE is a collection of two different computer clusters managed by the College of Computing and Partnership for an Advance Cluster Environment (PACE).
The ICE project originated in 2018 as an educational resource for graduate and undergraduate students to gain first-hand scientific computing experience. Along with using ICE in credit-bearing courses at Georgia Tech, PACE research scientists use ICE to host tutorials and workshops for researchers to improve their computational skills, like hackathons.
While the hackathon provided participants with opportunities to advance their research, it also acted as a laboratory for NVIDIA, and the HPC community overall, to study the latest hardware in action and attain user feedback.
This mutual relationship between hardware and software developers ensures the HPC field progresses forward together to continue overcoming computational challenges of the future.
“Thank you to the event co-sponsors, NVIDIA and OpenACC, and the additional mentors from NASA that helped make this hackathon happen,” Bryngelson said. “I would also like to acknowledge and thank the PACE team at Georgia Tech, who served dual roles as mentors and made sure the computing happened. We’re very fortunate to have such great people like them helping in so many different ways.”
Researchers Recognized as DARPA Risers
Four researchers from the College of Computing community were recognized as DARPA Risers during the agency’s recent DARPA Forward conference in Atlanta. Eight other Georgia Tech researchers were also recognized at the event.
DARPA Risers are up-and-coming standouts in their fields, whose research is related to national security and demonstrates the potential to lead to technological surprise — the heart of DARPA's mission. The Risers program provides individuals in the early stages of their research career a unique opportunity to be recognized for their notable work and present their ideas directly to DARPA.
Risers were nominated by DARPA program managers and stakeholders at their home universities, said Stefanie Tompkins, DARPA’s director. Their ability to create technological surprise, she said, “is something very special to us at DARPA.”
In all, 20 DARPA Risers were invited to attend the recent conference. They presented posters, and five – including four Georgia Tech faculty members – were selected to make brief presentations on their research. The DARPA Risers from the College are:
Paul Pearce, assistant professor in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy, who was recognized for “Algorithmic and Systems Foundations for IPv6 Internet Scanning.”
Ahmed Saeed, assistant professor in the School of Computer Science, who was recognized for Improving the Performance and Robustness of LEO Satellite Networks.
Anqi Wu, assistant professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering, who was recognized for Understanding the Brain Using Interpretable Machine Learning Models.

Researchers to Study Connection Between Online Misinformation and Real-World Violence
It is well known that predators lurk on the internet seeking to harm others through misinformation, bullying, and hate speech. What is not understood, however, is how online abuse and harassment like this can spread via misinformation and lead to real, physical violence in communities.
To understand and counter this phenomenon, two faculty members with Georgia Tech’s College of Computing are leading a two-year study on the impact of online violence-provoking misinformation and hate speech toward minority populations.
Realizing the implication on public health and safety, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is funding the study through a $678,000 grant. Georgia Tech’s Srijan Kumar is the principal investigator of the CDC grant while Munmun De Choudhury is co-PI.
“The conversations we have and the information we consume on the web really shape our behavior not just online, but in the real-world,” said Kumar, an assistant professor with the School of Computational Science and Engineering. “We need systematic evaluations and an all-hands-on-deck approach to study what sort of societal impact harmful online content has on health, equity, integrity, and safety.”
Inspiration for this study comes from the researchers’ observations of prevalent hate speech and calls for racially motivated violence on the internet and social media. This issue became more prominent during the Covid-19 pandemic.
In their grant proposal, the researchers say more than 11,000 incidents of physical violence and online aggression against Asians were reported during the pandemic. They also state that misinformation about Covid-19 led to destruction of property and over 800 deaths.
To understand the connection between virtual misinformation and physical violence, the study has four stated goals:
- Identify health misinformation that promotes community violence
- Map and measure prevalence of violence-provoking health misinformation across social media platforms
- Establish the causal impact of such misinformation on consumers’ reactions and intention to engage in harm
- Design mitigation and intervention strategies to reduce the prevalence of such misinformation
According to the group, social media is often “ground-zero” for health misinformation where it spreads at exceptional speed and scale. That is why the team intends to study hate speech and misinformation on social media platforms Twitter and Reddit.
“The very use of these platforms is impacting us in different ways. Sometimes these impacts are good, sometimes they are bad,” said De Choudhury, an associate professor with the School of Interactive Computing. “As we think about our wellbeing and the role of these online platforms, we cannot ignore the very fact that misinformation on those platforms is affecting our wellbeing in negative ways.”
The group selected Twitter and Reddit specifically due to their prominence in networking and wide range of demographically diverse users, a fact supported by Pew Internet Research statistics.
Diversity of the two social media platforms make them the ideal ecosystem for what the group intends to observe: anti-Asian and Anti-Black violence-provoking misinformation.
Given the correlation of Covid-19 misinformation spread and increase of discrimination and violence toward Asian and Black communities during the pandemic, the researchers believe their findings will make meaningful impact for people affected by this public health issue.
For example, the group points out that misinformation masquerading as medical racism further targeted Black communities. As a result, this both degraded trust in institutions and diminished vaccine efficacy during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Purdue University Assistant Professor Laura Schwab Reese, an expert in community and behavioral health, joins Kumar and De Choudhury in their research. Together, they will collaborate with the non-profit Anti-Defamation League during the study. Backed with CDC funding, the team will develop tools to study and find solutions to violence-provoking health misinformation.
For example, the researchers will start by developing algorithms to detect health misinformation and violence-provoking hate speech targeting minorities. These algorithms will rely on the latest machine learning methodologies and social media data sets.
From there, the group can build an interactive dashboard that maps the spread of violence-provoking misinformation online and offers analytic capabilities on the visualized data for end users. This will provide quantitative insight about the causal relationship between misinformation exposure and violent attitudes toward targeted communities.
Finally, the team will provide an intervention design plan to mitigate the impact of the misinformation. This will include presenting exploratory evaluation of interventions, and even creating new social media-based intervention tools that can interrupt misinformation.
By leveraging computing methods and interdisciplinary collaboration, the group is poised to make online and physical communities safer places for all.
“The reason we are partnering with the Anti-Defamation League and public health researchers is because community engagement is paramount in this work,” De Choudhury said. “One of the unique things about this study is that the computational techniques and interventions we will develop will be informed by the communities who are targeted by these incidents.”
Researchers Unleash 'Stanceosaurus' to Cross-culturally Combat Misinformation
Georgia Tech researchers and students are using machine learning tools to break through language barriers to help non-English speaking social media users be more aware of misinformation spreading online.
School of Interactive Computing associate professor Alan Ritter and assistant professor Wei Xu, along with students Jonathan Zheng, Ashutosh Baheti, and Tarek Naous, will introduce “Stanceosaurus” at the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, which runs from Dec. 7-11 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
Consisting of 28,033 tweets in English, Hindi, and Arabic — each annotated with a pro or con stance toward 251 misinformation claims — the corpus was named “Stanceosaurus” because the researchers believe it to be the largest dataset of its kind. The project was funded in part by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) Better Program.
A stance refers to whether a social media post is supporting or refuting a misinformation claim. Ritter and Xu are using the Stanceosaurus dataset to train a machine learning model that can quickly identify whether a tweet regarding a misinformation claim is supporting or refuting it. That helps journalists and fact checkers quickly understand if a misinformation claim is gaining support and how quickly the misinformation is spreading.
“You want to automate the prediction of stance,” Ritter said. “If you have a claim that aliens built the pyramids, and then you have a tweet that mentions some of those keywords, you want to have a machine learning model that will take the claim and the tweet as input and then make a prediction on whether the tweet is supporting or refuting the claim.
“Any tweets supporting that claim can be quickly brought to the attention of content moderators, and they could take appropriate action according to the policies of the social media company.”
The misinformation claims in Stanceosaurus originate from 15 fact-checking sources and incorporate a diverse sample of geographic regions and cultures.
While Stanceosaurus may be the largest such corpus, Wei said what makes it unique is its ability to combat misinformation multilingually.
“It’s very hard to break the precedent,” Wei said. “We had to do something much better than the precedent in order to make a difference. Misinformation is a very popular area of study. However, the quality of the prior work has various pitfalls. Most of the work falls under a single language, which is bad because misinformation is a global problem. A lot of misinformation targets minority groups.”
“Recent models do this in a language-independent way,” added Ritter. “The interesting thing about these multilingual models is that you can train them on this annotated data that’s labeled only in English, and then you can take the model and use it to make predictions on other languages.”
Wei said there are still some hurdles that are difficult to get over when considering the context or hidden meanings behind some tweets. There’s always the possibility that a statement in a tweet could be sarcastic, or someone could be asking a question, and it would be difficult for a machine to tell whether the question is being asked honestly or rhetorically.
“The difficulty is that some of the stances are a little more subtle,” Wei said. “Maybe someone phrases it like, “Is this really true?” when we know the person doesn’t believe it’s true. They phrase it as a question, but they’re still leaning toward refuting. So, there are some gray areas with these labels."
That’s why the research team used five classifications for their model — refuting, supporting, querying, discussing, and irrelevant. In the querying classification, a user may simply be asking an honest question to gain more information. In the discussing classification, one or more parties may provide neutral information on the context or veracity of the claim.
As big as Stanceosaurus is, there’s plenty of room for growth. It works across three languages, two of which Ritter and Wei chose because they had students who already knew those languages.
Ritter and Wei said research in the field of misinformation is a community effort. Their work was inspired by previous efforts, such as Google’s BERT, and they hope the research community will build upon Stanceosaurus.
“We’re very interested in expanding the languages we cover,” Wei said. “We are working on expanding it in Spanish. The Spanish-speaking community in the U.S. may be more vulnerable to misinformation. Ideally, we want to cover all the major languages in the world. Hopefully, it encourages more researchers to make a major effort to contribute to our work.”
“I think that would be great if people can have some sort of centralized repository where people could contribute new languages to Stanceosaurus,” added Ritter. “For whatever reason, no one had ever made a multilingual data set for this stance task, which is surprising to me because I think it’s important to be able to recognize misinformation across languages and cultures.”
Responsibility Key to Broader Understanding and Acceptance of AI in 2022
Artificial intelligence (AI) that can understand and express human emotions may be on the horizon in 2022. This is just one of the major tech stories that experts from Georgia Tech’s College of Computing say could be trending in the new year.
For its What’s Next in Tech for 2022 survey the College turned to its faculty leadership team and advisory board to get their educated opinions on potential technology trends and developments that could make headlines in the next 12 to 18 months.
So, what do the experts think could be some of the big technology stories in 2022?
“Cybersecurity is high on the list due to the significant number of large hacking events that have occurred over the last couple of years. Graphics, augmented reality, and VR are others due to the sudden push to create metaverses,” says Olufisayo Omojokun, director of the College’s Division of Computing Instruction.
In terms of verticals, “we will be hearing a lot more about innovations and investments in climate and sustainability, the metaverse, the creator economy, Web3 (decentralized web), and blockchain,” says Vanessa Larco, Georgia Tech alumna (CS 08), advisory board member, and partner with New Enterprise Associates.
[RELATED: Experts Identify Key Opportunities for Tech Entrepreneurs in 2022]
School of Computer Science Chair and Professor Vivek Sarkar agrees that blockchain tech will continue to grow and expand into new business sectors in 2022.
“Beyond banks, insurance, and other financial domains, I expect the increased adoption of blockchain will enable secure management of critical data and smart contracts in a wider range of transactions related to e-commerce and business partnerships. This growth is driven by current needs and the increasing maturity of blockchain technologies,” said Sarkar.
“The metaverse accelerates, crypto dominates, and supercomputing will be key to virus fighting,” says advisory board member Mark Bell, who is the head of Private Capital and Family Office Services at Balentine.
Bell adds, “AI with emotions will be the next large wave. This is incredibly important and a challenge for us to address.”
This response highlights the increasingly critical role of ethics and responsibility in AI, which several experts also see as likely impacting the field in 2022.
As the year unfolds, experts expect to see responsibility “increasing in relevance and importance with wide-scale acknowledgment that ethics are crucial to prevent issues related to bias and discrimination in AI,” says Sheetal Wrzesien, Georgia Tech alumna (CS 94), advisory board member and engineering leader at Google.
“Both ethics and provable behavior are key to the adoption of AI where human life is at stake or where adversarial behavior (adversarial AI) can alter the outcome,” says David Aucsmith, Georgia Tech alumnus (MS ICS 84), advisory board member and senior principal research scientist with the University of Washington’s Applied Physics Laboratory.
Perhaps nowhere is human life potentially more at stake than it is with autonomous vehicles, which rely heavily on evolving AI technologies.
“I expect there to be increased focus and scrutiny on self-driving cars, particularly as Tesla expands access to its recently released full self-driving features,” says Anil Chawla, advisory board member and ArchiveSocial board of director’s executive chairman.
“And, I expect self-driving and autonomous vehicles to be the tip of the spear of bringing the topic of ethical AI to the public forefront, likely with sensational media coverage, as manufacturers continue to introduce this technology to the masses and encounter real-world edge cases,” Chawla adds.
Along with a growing recognition of the importance of ethics in the field, AI is expected to figure prominently in other technology domains in 2022.
According to the survey, accelerated growth in data analytics powered by AI is expected, along with an expanding presence in public health and medicine, decision and policy making, and cybersecurity.
“As data analysis powered by AI and machine learning continues to influence and expand into broader areas, there will be a virtuous cycle of the application areas driving and motivating the next major methodological and foundational advances in computing,” says Haesun Park, Chair and Regents' Professor of the School of Computational Science and Engineering.
Cybersecurity is another domain impacted by AI that is sure to make headlines in the coming months.
“Ransomware will continue to evolve both in the sophistication of the tools and the audacity of the attacks. It is still far too simple and too profitable to go away next year,” says Aucsmith. However, he expects, “continued diplomatic pressure, law enforcement success, and legal repercussions will eventually dampen its use.”
Sarkar says software engineers, regardless of industry, must act now to increase their cybersecurity skills to ensure they are better prepared to anticipate and identify system and software threats.
“Cybersecurity-aware software engineering is going to be trending in 2022. This trend is being driven by business needs, given the increasing impact of ransomware and other security vulnerabilities. While there are some tactical solutions that can be deployed in the short term, there is no avoiding the need to revisit how software is engineered to mitigate security vulnerabilities in the future,” says Sarkar.
From Restaurateur to Tech Entrepreneur: Alum Tells Why the Shift Was Worth the Risk
Kabir Barday (BS CS 2009) always knew he wanted to own a business – his family owns restaurants and convenience stores, and he planned to follow in their footsteps.
“I had a pizza franchise all picked out,” he said.
After graduating from Georgia Tech with his computer science degree, Barday took a job at AirWatch, an enterprise mobile security startup eventually acquired by VMware. His plan was to save money to start his restaurant empire, but his computing work led him in a different direction.
“It’s riskier to be a real tech entrepreneur,” Barday said. “I never thought I would solve such a big problem.”
[RELATED: Barday's Tips for Future Entrepreneurs]
That big problem is data privacy and the hundreds of laws that govern it. Barday’s company, OneTrust, provides a privacy, security, and third-party risk technology platform to more than 3,000 companies. In July, OneTrust raised $200 million in a fundraising round that valued the company at $1.3 billion.
Although he didn’t intend to be a tech entrepreneur when he arrived on campus, Barday says that his Georgia Tech experience has been key to his success.
“Once you’re part of Georgia Tech, there are so many different paths you can take,” he said.
Entrepreneurial Education
Barday took advantage of multiple options for learning about business while he was an undergraduate. He got a certificate in entrepreneurship from the Institute.
“I still use some of the courses in that curriculum, like finance and accounting,” he said.
Barday named two key faculty mentors. The first, Distinguished Professor Merrick Furst, the director of the Center for Deliberate Innovation and an expert in commercialization and new venture creation.
“Learning about those philosophies and methodologies was really helpful,” Barday said.
The other mentor was School of Computer Science Professor Ellen Zegura, who oversaw Barday’s capstone project.
“I helped build a laboratory information management system for remote facilities in Africa,” he said. “In other words, I got experience solving real-world problems.”
The final key in Barday’s entrepreneurial education was his experience in the tech ecosystem of Atlanta. He joined TiE Atlanta, a local networking group for entrepreneurs, and attended their monthly meetings.
“I met so many people in the city who were doing great things and who really mentored me,” he said. “I would absolutely encourage students to take advantage of these resources.”
The Tech Difference
Barday and OneTrust have always hired a lot of Georgia Tech alumni — they are located in Atlanta, and of course, Barday knows first-hand the rigorous education our alumni have received.
Some of those alumni have been so good that they actually changed Barday’s hiring practices.
“I had a formula in my mind for what made a good job candidate,” he said. “Engineering degree, good GPA, lots of extracurriculars. Then I had a couple of candidates sneak through my process.” The candidates in question were Tech alumni, but with low GPAs.
“They were rock stars,” he said. “Some of the best I’ve ever hired.” He realized that a lot of non-academic factors can affect GPA – a family tragedy, for example, or even a change of major.
“Having that Georgia Tech background is a strong statement that kind of supersedes those problems,” he said.
Rising Stars: Georgia Tech Cyber Students Recognized as RSA Scholars
Two Ph.D. students studying in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP) will join students from over 30 universities and institutions at the RSA Conference where they will participate in the Security Scholars program.
Vagisha Srivastava and Yibin Yang will be among 80 cybersecurity students attending the conference and will have access to a wide range of perks offered to all participants. Throughout the second week of June students will have the opportunity to participate in team-building exercises, network with over 300 companies at the conference expo, attend an invitation only dinner with cybersecurity experts, and more.
Srivastava is a student in the School of Public Policy (SPP) where her research focuses on the policy side of cybersecurity. She is advised by SCP and SPP Professor Milton Mueller, who nominated her for the program.
“Vagisha is a cybersecurity-oriented policy student who is very bright,” said Mueller. “She is working on issues related to data governance by platforms and sovereignty and policy issues related to the digitization of money. She has also done studies of vulnerability disclosure programs in India.”
Yang, Georgia Tech’s second RSA Scholar, is studying cryptography under his advisor, SCP Associate Professor and Senior Associate Chair Vladimir Kolesnikov. Yang studies zero-knowledge proofs and practical secure multi-party computations.
“Yibin has deep expertise in zero-knowledge systems,” Kolesnikov said. “I know he will greatly contribute and learn from the RSA Scholar program.”

Robocalls No Match for AI-powered Virtual Assistant
With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), malicious robot calls may soon become a thing of the past thanks to a smartphone application developed by Georgia Tech researchers.
Created by Georgia Tech computing alum Sharbani Pandit (CS Ph.D. 21), RoboHalt uses machine learning and natural language processing to intercept and screen incoming calls for spam. The smartphone compatible virtual assistant successfully blocked 95% of mass robocalls, 82% of evasive robocalls, and 75% of targeted robocalls in Pandit’s research.
Traditional methods of blocking robocalls use blocklists, which are ineffective against caller ID spoofing. Robohalt solves this problem by intercepting the call and randomly asking the caller to hold or continue the conversation. The program asks a set of questions like “Who are you trying to reach?” and “Can you tell me more about it?” to unknown callers and determines if the call should be put through.
“A phone call from a number not saved in a contact list would get picked up by the virtual assistant which would then screen the caller,” Pandit said. “If the caller is a robot and cannot answer the questions the assistant asks, the call is terminated. If the caller passes, the call along with a transcript of the screening is forwarded to the user.”
While they are a nuisance to millions, robocalls also pose significant security threats. Like many scams, robocalls rely on their targets being convinced that the call is real. Examples include impersonating the IRS, law enforcement, or announcing that the caller has won a contest they never entered. Robohalt helps mitigate this by acting as a CAPTCHA test to filter out most of the spam.
Pandit graduated in Fall 2021 and now works on the Amazon Customer Trust and Partner Support group as an applied scientist. She assists Amazon in detecting fraud through research and maintaining the company’s current systems.
The research paper, Combating Robocalls with Phone Virtual Assistant Mediated Interaction, will be presented at the 32nd USENIX Security Symposium in August. Contributors to this project include Krishanu Sarker of Georgia State University, Roberto Perdisci of the University of Georgia, and Georgia Tech, as well as Mustaque Ahamad of Georgia Tech and Diyi Yang of Stanford University.
Pandit’s work on robocalls was covered by media publications DigitalTrends and NewScientist Magazine.

Truong’s research focuses on the next generation of artificially intelligent agents in sim2real, robotics, and embodied artificial intelligence (AI) spaces. This research helps robots physically interact with their environments to improve human’s quality of life, or virtual agents that can inspire creativity through demonstrations and conversations.
Robotics Professor Seeks to Revolutionize Heart Surgery Through NIH Grant
Matthew Gombolay has always had a heart for the healthcare industry.
When he was 20 years old, Gombolay was diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and had to have heart surgery to avoid serious health complications that he could have faced anytime. SVT causes an unusually fast or rapid heartbeat that affects the heart’s upper chambers.
Gombolay said he first knew something was wrong when he developed a rapid heartbeat when he was 14, but the condition was misdiagnosed as a symptom of puberty.
He knows the surgery saved his life.
“They gave me my life back,” said Gombolay, assistant professor and Director of the CORE Robotics lab at the School of Interactive Computing. “I’m immensely grateful for the field of cardiology.”
Now he’s looking to revolutionize the way open heart surgery is performed.
Gombolay received the prestigious National Institutes of Health RO1 grant, which will fund a three-year study of how robotics can improve and minimize the risks of open-heart surgery. Gombolay has partnered with Roger Dias, assistant professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Marco Zenati, professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and chief of cardiothoracic surgery for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to conduct the study.
Dias is also the Director of Research & Innovation at the STRATUS Center for Medical Simulation at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, which specializes in the research of human performance across high-risk clinical settings. For example, the STRATUS lab is also in a partnership with NASA in developing training solutions on how to perform medical procedures in space.
Dias said the use of robotics and data collection to stymie human error in medicine immediately stood out to him as something he wanted the STRATUS lab to be involved in.
“The reality is, human errors happen all the time,” Dias said. “Some studies estimate that human error is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Some of those errors are unavoidable, but a considerable number of human errors in the operating room are avoidable. The support system we are creating is really going in that direction of trying to make surgery safer, by helping surgical teams during complex decision making.”
Dias wanted to start with one of the most complex procedures — heart surgery. And one of the most challenging aspects of heart surgery is the management of a heart-lung bypass machine by a perfusionist. During most heart surgeries, the surgeon operates on a heart that isn’t beating and has no blood flow, while a perfusionist uses the heart-lung bypass machine to temporarily serve as the heart and the lungs.
Perfusionists oversee a complex and cognitive-demanding procedure. As any human, they are subject to fatigue, stress, and distractions, all of which could compromise patient safety. As of right now, it’s a job in which knowledge about best practices only comes through hands-on experience.
“Cardiac surgery may have between seven to 11 to 12 different people in the room and each one with a different function, different role,” Dias said. “The complexity of cardiac surgery really brought our attention to this type of research.
“The perfusionist has a very important role in controlling and managing the heart-lung machine. That’s why we selected the perfusionist — to understand their performance but also to support their performance.”
Gombolay designed a perfusionist-monitoring robot that can help track which specific moments of the procedures cause the most stress to the perfusionist as well as identify any distractions that may be affecting performance. The goal, Gombolay said, is not to replace perfusionists, but to support them by making as much relevant information as possible available to them and to create a gold standard across the medical industry.
“If a robot learns to do better than the status quo, the robot could learn to provide helpful explanations to give the surgical team insights into its decision making,” Gombolay said. “What can the machine teach us about the right metrics and how can that help predict outcomes? Maybe the machine can teach us what matters in order to improve the standardization of care.”
Rithy Srey, the Chief Perfusionist for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs who works with Zenati, will be one of the main perfusionists studied by Gombolay’s machine. In his 21 years of experience as a perfusionist, Srey has never had a fatal incident, but the stress and anxiety from the possibility of something going wrong is always there.
“There’s always a scare factor,” Srey said. “Your adrenaline will kick in; your heart is basically at the bottom of your stomach. Your fear for that patient’s life; that’s what keeps you focused.”
A lot of that anxiety comes from the unknown variables involved with each procedure. Patients may have some similarities, but each one is unique, Srey said.
“Some patients have higher red cell counts than others and some are sicker than others,” he said. “The way we flow is according to what the patient’s blood volume is and what the patient needs. There’s an average consideration to what the flow should be, but then you have someone who’s diabetic or someone with a kidney issue. How are you going to protect them?”
While a machine-learning system will directly benefit younger perfusionists in their training and early careers, Srey said more experienced perfusionists will welcome it with open arms.
“Too much experience under our belts, we get lackadaisical,” Srey said. “You become too relaxed and too jaded in the system to the point a computer system could help you. We don’t want to slack off.”
Dias began using Gombolay’s machine to gather data on live procedures on Sept. 1. He said by the end of the project he will have studied more than 100 procedures, which is about 400 hours of collected data. At the beginning of the second year, Dias will begin sending that data to Gombolay, who will mine it to create and test algorithms that can predict a perfusionist’s decisions.
By the third year, Gombolay and his team will have created an interface prototype that can be used in simulated procedures to help inform people training to become perfusionists. If those trials are successful, the machine could be ready to enter the medical industry and become a standard tool used in live heart procedures.
The biggest challenge along the way will be building trust with potential patients, who may be skeptical about an AI’s role in their medical treatment. Dias said one of the biggest reasons he wanted to partner with Gombolay is his ability to solve that problem.
“This is one of his areas of expertise — to work on the trustworthiness of AI systems,” Dias said. “That’s something we plan to address in this RO1. One is the trustworthiness of AI systems, and the other is the explanation of AI systems. They’re not going to trust because they want to know why. That’s what we call an Artificial Intelligence “black box” problem. Sometimes your algorithm is 100 percent accurate, but you cannot explain why the algorithm reached that decision.”
Gombolay said he’s up for the challenge. He recognizes the significance of being selected for an ROI, and it’s not something he’s going to take for granted.
According to the National Institutes of Health website, an RO1 grant is “an award made to support a discrete, specified, circumscribed project to be performed by the named investigator(s) in an area representing the investigator’s specific interest and competencies, based on the mission of the NIH.”
In general, the NIH grants RO1s to support projects it knows will have a beneficial outcome to its mission.
“I never imagined applying for one, let alone getting one,” Gombolay said. “When I got invited to do this, I was like, sure, sounds fun. The fact that we got one is just disbelief. It’s so competitive. Now we just have to deliver.”
Russia’s Failure in Cyberspace
Since 2014 Georgia Tech Assistant Professor Nadiya Kostyuk has studied the pattern of cyberattacks coming from within the borders of the Russian Federation against the country of Ukraine.
While fear of cyberattacks have grown during the current physical conflict in Ukraine, Kostyuk argues Russia has had to use a physical military presence to achieve what it could not by using cyberattacks.
During an appearance on MSNBC’s weekend news show American Voices with Alicia Menendez, Kostyuk explained despite using Ukraine as a “cyber-range” for eight years, Russia has not yet showed it is capable of an all-out cyberwar.
“If you think about how much time and effort it takes to develop the cyber operations to hack a critical infrastructure such as an electrical power grid, it is much easier to use the military already on the ground to capture or destroy it,” Kostyuk said during the Saturday night broadcast.
“The fact Russia had to deploy troops demonstrate the failure of cyber warfare on its own to achieve Russia’s strategic objectives.”
Kostyuk pointed out that Friday’s attack and capture of Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, could be an example of Russia needing to physically seize infrastructure they cannot capture and maintain through virtual attacks. Since January, Ukraine has seen multiple cyber-attacks in the public and private sector.
The Associated Press reported on Feb. 15, a series of cyber-attacks took down at least 10 Ukrainian websites including the country’s Defense Ministry, Foreign Ministry, and two of its largest banks. Bad actors used what is known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which uses bots to flood targeted websites with fake traffic. The sites were operational within a few hours following both the Feb. 15 attack and a second DDoS attack one week later.
“Cyberattacks have not been effective as a standalone operation against Ukraine,” Kostyuk told Menendez. “Of course, Russia will continue trying to penetrate the networks, of course it will try to complement the military operations on the ground, but we should not see major cyberwarfare because they have not been effective in cyberspace for the past eight years.”
While Russia has not been as active in cyberspace regarding destructive cyber-attacks, it has invested significant resources and expertise to its disinformation operations, Kostyuk added. The spreading of disinformation plays a critical and crucial role in Russia’s strategic tool kit.
Nadiya Kostyuk is an assistant professor at the Georgia Tech School of Cybersecurity and Privacy with a joint appointment at the School of Public Policy. In 2017 she and Yuri Zhukov of the University of Michigan co-authored Invisible Digital Front: Can Cyber Attacks Shape Battlefield Events? The paper was published by the Journal of Conflict Resolution and offered a quantitative analysis of the relationship between cyber activities and physical violence during war. Using data from cyber-conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, Kostyuk, and Zhukov concluded cyber-attacks were ineffective tools of war.

Tech no longer holds summer graduation activities, so nine School of CSE graduates that completed degrees this past summer will have the opportunity to participate in the Fall 2022 Commencement.
While “getting out” of Tech is the crowning achievement for many of these graduates today, bright futures still lay ahead.
These graduates will move on to work in industry, academia, and national labs, embodying the School of CSE as a diverse, interdisciplinary innovation ecosystem composed of award-winning researchers. This graduating class represents the next generation of leaders who will solve future problems in science, engineering, health, and social domains.
“Georgia Tech is a highly respected school in computer science and technology, thus opening more opportunities for students,” An said. “Tech has also prepared us through both theoretical and practical courses and provided us with resources for research and study to help us become better researchers.”
School of CSE Expands with Five New Faculty Hires
The School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) is expanding its research portfolio with the hiring of five new tenure-track faculty.
CSE is a unique entity in academia as it is one of the first and only schools the research and education involving the academic discipline of computational science and engineering. This distinction complements CSE’s mission to hire premier faculty and recruit top-tier students to solve real-world problems through advances in computational modeling methods and techniques.
The latest cohort of new CSE faculty includes Assistant Professors Spencer Bryngelson and Florian Schäefer who joined CSE at the start of the 2021 fall term. Nabil Imam, Anqi Wu, and Yunan Luo will join the School as assistant professors in January.
Bryngelson comes to CSE from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) where he worked as a senior postdoctoral researcher. He also served as a visiting researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as well as a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Exascale Simulation of Plasma-Coupled Combustion. His research emphasis is on computational physics, numerical methods, fluid dynamics, and HPC.
According to Bryngelson, “The department of CSE is a unique one from across the country and that’s part of the reason that I wanted to come to Georgia Tech. CSE lets me focus on the things that I really care about while not being in a monolithic type of environment and instead I can be focused more on my interests.”
He received his Ph.D. and M.S. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 2017 and 2015. In 2013, he received B.S. degrees in both Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics from the University of Michigan–Dearborn.
Schäefer’s arrival marks the expansion of CSE’s focus on mathematics-based research including partial differential equations, statistical inference, and game theory. He joins CSE after graduating in applied and computational mathematics from Caltech.
“I wanted to be in close contact with computationally-minded engineers and engineering departments in general. I think CSE plays this role quite nicely where it’s this computational arm so to speak of engineering efforts at Georgia Tech. It offers a rich environment for someone like me to find interesting problems and interesting things to look at from a psycho mathematical angle and hopefully design some new technology from that,” he said.
Before coming to Caltech, Schaefer obtained his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mathematics at the University of Bonn.
Imam’s research interests are in formal descriptions of neural computations and their applications to post-Moore computing.
He received his Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University in 2014, with minors in neuroscience and applied mathematics. During his time in graduate school, he worked on Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s SyNAPSE program and built computing systems modeled after the architecture and dynamics of biological neural networks. He subsequently worked at IBM Research as part of the design team for IBM’s TrueNorth. He also worked with Intel Labs on its Loihi neural computing systems.
According to Imam, he chose to pursue a role at CSE because of its supportive design for interdisciplinary research goals and he is looking forward to getting students excited about the application of CSE methods as they pertain to problems in neuroscience.
Wu is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. She received her Ph.D. degree in computational and quantitative neuroscience and a graduate certificate in statistics and machine learning from Princeton University in 2019. She holds a master’s degree in computer science from the University of Southern California (USC).
She worked as a summer research associate at the University of Texas at Austin and Microsoft Research, Cambridge. Her research interest is to develop Bayesian statistical models to characterize structure in neural data and animal behavior data in the interdisciplinary field of machine learning and computational neuroscience. Wu received the USC Chevron Fellowship and was selected for the 2018 MIT Rising Star in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
Wu said, “I am highly attracted to the School of CSE because of its deep commitment to interdisciplinary research and scientific computing. My interdisciplinary background in machine learning and computational neuroscience equips me well to complement and augment the school’s existing strengths. There are also various research collaboration opportunities, with outreach to BME, ECE, biological science, and the neuroscience program at Georgia Tech. I’m also looking forward to joining the community to foster a collaborative environment, especially between machine learning and neuroscience.”
Luo is currently concluding his term as a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Previously, he received his bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University in 2016. His research interests include computational biology and medicine, machine learning, and the scientific discovery that is guided by artificial intelligence (AI).
According to Luo, he chose to pursue a role at Georgia Tech due to its strong computational science and engineering, and computer science Ph.D. programs.
“I am most excited about the vibrant interdisciplinary research environment across the campus, which will provide many collaborative and translational research opportunities. I am thrilled to join CSE during this exciting time of rapid growth in AI and biomedical science and look forward to working with the amazing faculty members, students, and researchers here,” he said.
School Welcomes Four New Assistant Professors
Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) is continuing to grow with the hire of four tenure-track faculty.
Assistant Professors Peng Chen and Victor Fung joined CSE at the beginning of the 2022 fall semester. Elizabeth Qian began work Nov. 1 at Georgia Tech as a joint appointment assistant professor with the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering and the School of CSE. Nisha Chandramoorthy will join the School in Spring 2023 as an assistant professor.
The addition of these professors increases the School of CSE’s faculty total to 24, the highest in School history. This expansion is emblematic of the School’s enduring mission to develop scholars who solve real-world problems through advances in computational modeling methods and techniques.
Peng Chen comes to CSE from the University of Texas at Austin where he was a research scientist with the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences. Prior to that, he was a postdoctoral associate and instructor at ETH (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule), a public research university in Zürich, Switzerland.

School’s Growing Faculty Leads to More Students, More Research Funding, More Facilities
Faculty of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) held a retreat Aug. 11 in downtown Atlanta. There, they reflected upon the previous year while reaffirming the School’s vision for the new school year as a world-class, interdisciplinary academic unit.
“The School of CSE is a pioneer in the academic field of computational science and engineering,” said School of CSE Regents’ Professor and Chair Haesun Park. “There are many universities with a computational science and engineering presence, mostly in the form of a center or graduate program, but we are unique in that we have a school. Our School is the academic home for the field of CSE at Georgia Tech.”
Park opened the retreat with a presentation where she reiterated the School of CSE’s mission to:
- Solve real-world problems and improve quality of life through advances in computational foundational research, modeling, methods, and techniques.
- Foster collaboration and interaction to solve challenging problems in novel ways through interdisciplinary cooperation and broad partnerships.
- Create leaders in academia, industry, research laboratories, and government who innovate, define, and advance computational science and engineering agendas.
To help fulfill its mission, one primary goal the School seeks to accomplish this year is continue growing its faculty and student populations with emphasis on diversification.
The School of CSE's full-time faculty cohort grew from 13 professors in 2021 to 17 professors in 2022. Four joint professors continue to advise students, teach classes, and conduct research with the School.
The expansion in faculty yielded an increase in funded research projects. With a funding total exceeding $15 million, the School increased total projects from 88 to 97 between 2021 and 2022.
Along with increased research funding, the addition of more faculty allowed the School to enroll more students under its six doctorate and seven master’s degree programs. In December 2021 alone, nearly 50 CSE students earned their degrees and graduated, the one of the largest classes in School history.
The School of CSE students and recent alumni received numerous awards and accolades last year, setting high expectations for 2022-2023. CSE Ph.D. students Pranav Shetty and Zijie (Jay) Wang attained J.P. Morgan Chase AI research fellowships and CSE Ph.D. student Gaurav Verma was a finalist for an Adobe Ph.D. fellowship. Recent School of CSE alumni Fred Hohman and Srinivas Eswar received the SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award and the J.H. Wilkinson Postdoctoral Fellowship at Argonne National Laboratory respectively.
Located in the Coda building at Tech Square on the south wing of the 13th floor, the School’s newest challenge is providing working areas to keep pace with the rapid student enrollment rate. Park announced at the retreat that the School recently acquired the 13th floor east wing, providing additional offices for faculty and staff as well as more student workspaces.
“CSE is central to the vision and the plans for the College,” said Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay, Jr. chair of the College of Computing. “We have what I would say is the first successful intercollege school at Georgia Tech, I think we will see more and more people perceive CSE in that way and that it will be increasingly central for the future of sciences, engineering, and computing.”
SCI Continues Conversation and Research on TA Programs
School of Computing Instruction (SCI) faculty sparked a large discussion about teaching assistant (TA) programs at an international conference this month and are seeking collaborators to continue discussing and studying best practices.
SCI Inaugural Chair Olufisayo Omojokun, Associate Chair Mary Hudachek-Buswell, and Senior Lecturer Melinda McDaniel facilitated a series of discussions among faculty and student attendees at the SIGCSE conference March 16. After implementing a successful undergraduate TA program at Georgia Tech, the team’s goal is to continue improving while helping other institutions with their programs.
SCI faculty members teach all 1000- and 2000- courses required for all Georgia Tech undergraduates, as well as several upper-level courses. They manage nearly 400 TAs per semester and are leading discussions on lessons learned.
At the ‘Birds of a Feather’ talk, the team asked almost 100 attendees what their biggest questions were surrounding TA programs. The participants shared their successes and challenges within their own programs.
“The faculty participants really want to take care of their TAs,” Hudachek-Buswell said. “Some of them have hard problems and these are things that need to be discussed.”
Dozens of participants asked questions about starting and maintaining TA programs at their institutions. Most worked with functioning programs, but they acknowledged that there were critical areas where improvement is needed, particularly in training, funding, and scaling programs to keep up with enrollment.
Questions from participants include:
- How do you get a good TA program started?
- How do we recruit, hire, train, manage, and support multiple TAs for multiple courses at once?
- How can we expand our TA program at the same pace as enrollment?
- How much should undergraduate TAs get paid?
- How do you consistently train TAs and evaluate the effectiveness of the training?
- What resources does your institution provide (funding, staff support, etc.) for TA training programs?
- How do you balance recruiting TAs for more advanced courses with retaining veteran TAs for lower division courses?
- How can we get enough support from our TAs without (a) overloading them or (b) giving them too much power?
Now, the team’s goal is to continue the conversation and further explore best practices in TA programs to assist in answering these and other questions. To do this, they plan to collaborate with fellow faculty in the computer science education field.

“People have questions, and no TA program is perfect. Even the good ones want to improve, and this is taking a step towards that,” Omojokun said. “Seeing what our peers are doing and perspectives other folks have is going to be a good way of taking that next step.”
Together, SCI faculty and collaborators will discuss solutions and will provide an outlet to disseminate the information to other educators looking to build or improve a TA program.
“Some faculty have proven solutions to share, and SCI can be a channel to share this information,” said McDaniel, who presented at multiple SIGCSE events. “We want to take this to the next level.”

Scientist Presents Out of this World Research at International Conference
The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) hosted this week its biennial activity group conference on computational science and engineering (SIAM CSE23) in Amsterdam.
There, nearly half of the faculty body from Georgia Tech’s School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) had research accepted for presentation to fellow members of the world’s largest organization devoted to applied mathematics, computational science, and data science.
One notable, literally out of this world, presentation comes from Elizabeth Qian, an assistant professor with joint appointments in the School of CSE and the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering.
Qian presented at the conference a new computational framework for engineering analysis that was applied to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The method proved to reduce the time required to perform a design analysis from more than two months to less than two days.
In addition to reducing the time required to perform this analysis, the framework also makes results more consistent and robust. These technical performance improvements can help keep complex space missions, like the JWST, on schedule and on budget, contributing to overall mission success.
“Working with domain experts at NASA on the analysis of a space system is very exciting,” Qian said. “There are unique challenges that are encountered in the design of real-world systems that we don’t encounter when prototyping methods.”
Qian’s framework speeds up and reduces error of uncertainty quantification calculations. Uncertainty quantification is the science of accounting for uncertainty and determining the likelihood of certain outcomes if some aspects of a system are unknown.
Since uncertainties are present in most complex, large-scale engineering systems, like the JWST, this framework provides design methods and tools that can be applied to many other projects here on Earth.
“This framework is already having an impact on applications from plasma fusion to water resource management,” said Qian. “The beauty of CSE research is that it can be applied to almost anything in science, engineering, and medicine.”
Some uncertainties engineers must account for when designing the JWST are how temperature changes affect the telescope’s optics when it slews from one observation target to another. These temperature changes can distort the telescope’s images.
To overcome this challenge, Qian teamed with NASA engineer Giuseppe Cataldo and Jeremy Auclair, a research engineer at Centre d’Etudes Spatiales de la Biosphère in Toulouse, France.
In their study, the new method analyzed the optical error caused by temperature changes and identified which telescope structures had the largest impact on this error.
Tested through thousands of rigorous simulations, the team’s framework uses a mix of low and high-fidelity models to reduce error and improve calculation speed.
While less accurate, low-fidelity models run faster and improve the framework’s overall computational speed. A more expensive high-fidelity model is used in the framework to ensure accuracy of results and retain the physics of the phenomena the model is trying to represent.
Grounded upon interdisciplinary collaboration and poised for real-world application, the framework made for worthy scholarship accepted at SIAM CSE23. There, Qian represented the research team and the School of CSE when she gave a presentation of the paper.
The School of CSE formed a strong contingent of 11 presenting faculty at SIAM CSE23, nearly half of the School’s faculty body at a single conference.
Along with Qian, School of CSE faculty with papers accepted at the conference include:
- Spencer Bryngelson
- Ümit Çatalyürek
- Nisha Chandramoorthy
- Peng Chen
- Elizabeth Cherry
- Edmond Chow
- Felix Herrmann, joint with the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
- Surya Kalidindi, joint with the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering
- Florian Schäfer
- Rich Vuduc
SIAM CSE23 is the designated, biennial conference for the SIAM Activity Group on Computational Science and Engineering. Here, School of CSE Professor and Associate Chair Edmond Chow serves as the activity group’s program director, a position he recently attained in December 2022.
School of CSE Regents' Professor and Chair Haesun Park served on the selection committee for for the James H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, which was awarded at the conference.
Another notable School of CSE highlight at the conference was the presence of Assistant Professor Peng Chen. Chen presented one paper that he authored, he co-authored five additional papers, and he organized two panels.
On the final day of SIAM CSE23, the conference announced that School of CSE Associate Professor and Associate Chair Elizabeth Cherry would co-chair the organizing committee for SIAM CSE25. The 2025 conference will take place March 2 – 7 in Fort Worth, Texas.
Whether it is research collaboration at an international conference or application on a telescope orbiting Earth, the School of CSE is distinguishing itself as a leader in solving scientific and engineering challenges through computational methods.
“It’s great to have such a strong Georgia Tech representation at the conference. It really points to Tech being an excellent place for impactful, interdisciplinary work,” Qian said.
Search Opens to Fill Endowed Computational Journalism Chair
The search for the inaugural Krishna A. Bharat Chair in Computational Journalism at the Georgia Institute of Technology has been launched by the Georgia Tech College of Computing.
This new, endowed chair is part of a larger commitment in the college to computing and the public interest. Computing has already transformed how news is reported and delivered but, computing programs have not typically considered the impacts of their work on the news industry, much less the public sphere.
“We aren’t looking to ‘solve’ or ‘fix’ journalism with computers, an approach that has probably caused more harm than good,” said Ian Bogost, the chair of the search committee. “Instead, we are looking to fuse the journalistic ethos of service with the undeniable power and influence of computational methods.”
Bogost is the Ivan Allen College Distinguished Chair of Media Studies and a professor of Interactive Computing.
Krishna A. Bharat (MS CS 93, Ph.D. 96), who endowed the chair along with his wife, Kavitha Thirumalai, is a Distinguished Research Scientist at Google and the creator of Google News. In a Q&A conducted at the time of the endowment, Bharat spoke of the need for leadership in this area.
“While technology holds a lot of promise, it can also create challenges for publishers and society, ranging from information overload and filter bubbles to disinformation and manipulation by outside actors. Publishers face business model challenges in a crowded and continuously evolving ecosystem. There is both a need to study these phenomena and craft solutions that will in part depend on computing,” said Bharat.
The eventual new hire will join a college that has a myriad of existing commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion in computing, not to mention the diverse communities of Atlanta and Georgia.
“We have seen repeatedly in computing that we must build in mechanisms for responsibility at every step of our processes and plans.

Shana White: A Jock Who Proves that Computer Science is Cool
Jocks can’t be nerds. That’s just not how it works, usually. But Shana White is proof that you cannot only be a jock and a nerd, but that you can excel at both.
White, an Atlanta native and former physical education and health teacher, has worked with grades K-12 and served as an adjunct professor at Georgia Gwinnet College. At every level, White has helped to bridge the gap between what is considered “nerdy” and what is considered “athletic”.
She is continuing these efforts with the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech where she is a Constellations Fellow. Her primary role is to develop computer science education programs and bring them to high school classrooms in the Atlanta Public School system.
Shana White Named to Georgia Tech Diversity and Inclusion Fellow Class of 2019
Shana White is already a jack of all trades and she can now add another title to her impressive resume. White was recently named a 2019 Georgia Tech Diversity and Inclusion Fellow.
White was one of 21 people from across campus named to the 2019 class. Computer Science (CS) undergraduate student Lorin Achey and CS graduate student Keshav Bumbraw also earned the prestigious fellowship this year. In all, there were 94 applicants.
White is currently a Constellations Center for Equity in Computing Fellow. Her continued work through the Diversity and Inclusion program help the center’s ongoing efforts to combat the shortage of K-12 computer science teachers in Georgia and across the country.

The South’s Metropolis Changes Student’s Life and Views of Diversity, For the Better
Moving often has a big impact on someone’s life, and for Greer Cobb, moving just one state away has changed everything.
Cobb spent the first 10 years of her life in Mountain Brook, Ala., an upscale suburb of Birmingham that is 97% white. After Cobb’s parents divorced and her mom remarried, the family moved to Atlanta, Ga., a city that is only 40% white.
While she credits her Alabama schools for instilling an intense work ethic that she carries with her, Cobb, who is white, recognizes how the lack of different perspectives could have been harmful to her had she stayed.
Staff Member Using Art and Microsoft Grant to Improve STEM Accessibility
Birney Robert is challenging local artists and researchers: find new ways of collaborating to expand access to science and technology for the Atlanta community.
This is no idle challenge. Robert, an events planner with the Georgia Tech College of Computing, was recently awarded a $40,000 Georgia Tech/Microsoft Accessibility Research Seed Grant through the Center for 21st Century Universities to make these collaborations a reality.
She earned the funding for her proposal, Accessible Exhibits at the Intersection of Art, Science, and Technology. It spells out plans for two exhibits, one per semester possibly starting next fall, that include new and existing work from different collaborations between artists and researchers.
Robert says one of the project’s goals is to break down existing silos that limit access to science and technology, especially for people from underserved communities.
“Not only will the exhibits be ADA compliant, but also free to enter and done in a way that cultivates community, involves artists with disabilities, and challenges existing notions of who gets access to and representation in the space,” said Robert.
The exhibits will last six to eight weeks and be located in accessible public space at Georgia Tech. They will include audio translations, braille signage, and a website featuring the work, artist profiles, exhibition statements, and video interviews with the artists and researchers.
Along with taking on physical and economic access, Robert is working to expand intellectual access as well. The hope is to use the power of art as a way to demystify science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
“By contextualizing STEM through art, these exhibits will promote inclusivity, accessibility, and civic engagement, and will hopefully be seen as a form of cultural brokering between Georgia Tech and the Atlanta community,” said Robert, who holds a bachelor’s degree in fine arts from Birmingham-Southern College.
Once the exhibits are complete, Robert will document her experiences as a feasibility study. Visitor surveys and other methods will be used to gauge interest in this type of exhibit in the Georgia Tech, Midtown, broader Atlanta communities.
Ultimately, she hopes this project will serve as a step toward a permanent space on campus that is dedicated to accessible exhibits that serve to demystify STEM and promote inclusivity.
“Art is an avenue where we can understand more than the written word. It’s a discipline that I identify closely with,” said Robert, who is pursuing a master’s degree in museum anthropology at Georgia State University.
“I believe a permanent museum and residency program on campus to display Georgia Tech research in new and exciting ways in a public space would be an incredible opportunity to open critical dialogue with the community.”
Robert has been with the college for nearly seven years. As an events planner, she has a critical role in ensuring events like college graduation celebrations, hall of fame ceremonies, and high-profile speaking engagements happen without a hitch.
From time to time, she is able to incorporate her artistic side into her event planning. A great example was the launch of the Institute for Data Engineering and Science. Not content with simple floral arrangements for the luncheon tables, Robert handmade centerpieces with old motherboards, wires, and light bulbs.
“It’s because of the College of Computing that I am where I am today. It’s given me so many opportunities that help me along this path called life.”
Staff Member's Art Exhibition Recognized for 'Contributing to the Fabric of the State'
The College of Computing has won a 2023 Georgia Association of Museums (GAM) award thanks to the work of staff member Birney Robert.
The award honors Extension of Self: What it Means to be Human in a Digital World, an exhibit curated by Robert, who works as an events coordinator for the College. The award recognizes special projects that "demonstrate scholarship and originality contributing to the cultural fabric of the state," according to the GAM website.
The exhibit was on display in the Georgia Tech Library from August to October last year and featured six interactive digital art installations, including one by Assistant Professor Ashutosh Dhekne of the School of Computer Science. Each installation considered ways in which technology has become integrated into our lives, with a special focus on accessibility. The exhibit had nearly 1,000 visitors, including eight classes of Georgia Tech students brought by their instructors.
“I think art can be another avenue for making knowledge at a top-tier research university,” Robert said. “I know I learned a lot.”
In the process of curating the exhibit and other related programming, Birney Robert worked with Robert “Trey” Quinn, president of the GT Able Alliance, which is a student group dedicated to improving disability inclusion on campus. She also consulted with the Center for Inclusive Design and Innovation. Full Radius Dance, a local dance troupe that includes and challenges people of all abilities, performed at the opening.
[RELATED: Staff Member Using Art and Microsoft Grant to Improve STEM Accessibility]
Robert will curate another art exhibit in the coming year, this one on climate and the environment. She believes these interactive digital arts experiences are good for the Institute as a whole.
“Georgia’s economy is developing so fast in arts and entertainment,” she said, “and this gives us connections in that sector.” Robert is a member of the Institute’s Visual Arts Working Group, an initiative under the Institute’s Arts@Tech Institute Strategic Plan.
The exhibit was funded by a $40,000 Georgia Tech/Microsoft Accessibility Research Seed Grant through the Center for 21st Century Universities

State Farm Grants Its Neighbor $30,000 to Increase Access to Computer Science Education in Atlanta
It’s true, like a good neighbor State Farm is there. In fact, the insurance company recently supported its Atlanta neighbor, the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech (Constellations), with a $30,000 gift for the centers Computing Equity Project.
STEM Equity Expert Bringing Her Experience to the Constellations Center
The College of Computing is pleased to announce that Tamara Pearson has joined the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech as its new Senior Director of Research and Programs. In her new position, Pearson is charged with helping set the Center’s intellectual and research agenda, as well as managing the Center’s expanding portfolio of initiatives.
“I want to be at an institution that is pushing the intellectual frontier of computing education in a society that is quickly becoming dependent on these critical skills,” Pearson said. “And I am excited to help tackle the grand educational challenges that will be the difference between those at the center of modern society and those in the margins.”
Before coming to Constellations, Pearson served as the inaugural Director for the Center of Excellence for Minority Women in STEM at Spelman College. Before that, she was the Associate Director of School and Community Engagement at the Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics and Computing (CEISMC), at Georgia Tech. She has an M.Ed. and Ph.D. in education from the University of Florida, and a B.S. in mathematics and computer science from Spelman College.
“The challenge ahead,” Pearson said, “is having the moral courage to take on the systemic challenges that have led to the marginalization of specific groups of students for generations.” “Achieving equitable computing education is just the latest iteration of an old problem. My goal is for Constellations to have a research agenda and programs that are both morally courageous and intellectually rigorous.”
Atlanta and the state of Georgia face some specific challenges in improving the tech eco-system and making it more equitable and accessible for all, Pearson said.
“The legacy of racial segregation in the South remains untarnished and there is evidence that resegregation is increasing and wiping away what little gains there had been,” she said. “Addressing equitable computing education in that environment is a grand national challenge.”
“Pearson is just the right person at just the right time to help the Constellations Center position Georgia Tech at the center of this monumental effort to bring computing education to all students,” said Kamau Bobb, Constellations senior director.
As the College of Computing is establishing itself as a critical player in the national effort to improving computing education in both instruction, research and access, we are absolutely lucky to have Tamara as the new senior director of Research and Programs,” said Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay, Jr. chair of computing. “She has the experience, the passion, and the intellectual drive to help us find the path to more equitable computing.
Stewarding the Land with Technology: Q&A with New Associate Professor Josiah Hester
Josiah Hester believes battery-free devices are the future of computing, and the quicker we get there, the better.
Hester is the new Catherine M. and James E. Allchin Junior Faculty Chair at the College of Computing. He’s also a new associate professor in the School of Interactive Computing and computer science. Hester spent five years as an assistant professor at Northwestern University, where he directed the Ka Moamoa Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing Lab.
Hester focuses on developing sustainable, battery-free technology, including health-wearables and interactive devices. Through his lab, Hester developed a “FaceBit” smart face mask that can monitor someone’s heartbeat and is powered by a person’s breathing.
He also co-developed a battery-free handheld gaming device nearly identical to the original Game Boy, except that it’s powered by small solar panels and energy produced by mashing the buttons on the console. Hester will be moving his Ka Moamoa Lab to Georgia Tech from Northwestern.
In February of 2022, Hester received a Faculty Early Career Development Program Award from the National Science Foundation. In 2021, he was named to the Brilliant 10 by Popular Science, and he received the Most Promising Engineer or Scientist Award from the American Indian Science Engineering Society, which recognizes significant contributions from the indigenous peoples of the North America and the Pacific Islands in STEM disciplines.
What interests you about working at Georgia Tech?
I’m really looking forward to collaborating broadly with Georgia Tech faculty and students around sustainability and health, areas that Tech has global leadership in and strong institutional support.
What will your research consist of?
I lead a research lab exploring energy-efficient computing in the context of global-scale applications. I work toward a sustainable future for computing informed by my Native Hawaiian (Kanaka maoli) heritage. We mainly try to figure out how to make ubiquitous computing and sensing devices like wearables, smart devices, and sensor networks run forever with a lower impact on the planet and the humans using or tending to these devices. I call these sustainable computational things. A core problem we tackle is designing computers that harvest energy from the sun, motion, and other sources instead of relying on a battery, which is toxic, short-lived, and unsustainable, so that these devices can be useful for decades.
Recently, we have been investing a lot of time into applying these techniques to large-scale sensing for sustainability and conservation with a $5 million grant from the National Science Foundation. By partnering with indigenous knowledge holders, conservation organizations, and academics across political science, ecology, and environmental sciences, we can develop holistic approaches to managing precious natural resources for generations.
What inspired you to pursue this field of research?
My work sits in the space where computing becomes physical. This means that we can use computing and intelligent systems to start addressing actual problems in the physical world. I wanted my work to matter to communities and people living now, so we find research problems in real-world constraints. As a Native Hawaiian, I was raised to believe that we had an unbreakable bond to steward the land (Aloha ʻĀina). Since the beginning, computing has been focusing on performance at the expense of energy and power. We cannot continue in this manner. I was inspired to figure out if we could do better, sustainable, battery-free, long-term. What happens if we design for those features instead of performance alone? Thankfully, many others have the same inspiration, and we really see change focused on longer-term computing. It is an exciting time for the field.
What do you hope to accomplish in your research?
We are trying to show that an alternative, more sustainable, and more equitable version of computing is possible. Right now, wearables, the internet of things, and edge computing favor only the few that can afford them. I interpret sustainability broadly, where devices should be low cost, easy to program and use, low burden, and last forever — or at least longer than your average cell phone. It's a big goal, and we have a lot of work to do, but I'm excited that so many at Georgia Tech are already partnering with us to make it happen.
What are you looking forward to about teaching your students and how do you plan to work with them?
I am looking forward to partnering with my students on cutting-edge research and learning from each of them how they interpret sustainability, access, and the burden of computing. I hope I can equip them to tackle new challenges around health and sustainability in their communities.
Strong Georgia Tech Presence at Top Computer Architecture Conference
School of Computer Science (SCS) professors had five papers at the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO) this October. The conference showcases groundbreaking computer architecture research.
“Georgia Tech had a very strong presence at MICRO, representing about 5 percent of the papers appearing at the conference and placing us among the top five institutions in paper count this year,” said SCS Assistant Professor Alexandros Daglis.
SCS papers included:
COSPlay: Leveraging Task-Level Parallelism for High-Throughput Synchronous Persistence
Marina Vemmou, Alexandros Daglis
Cerebros: Evading the RPC Tax in Datacenters
Arash Pourhabibi, Mark Sutherland (EPFL); Alexandros Daglis (GT); Babak Falsafi (EPFL)

ADAPT: Mitigating Idling Errors in Qubits via Adaptive Dynamical Decoupling
Poulami Das (GT); Swamit Tannu (University of Wisconsin-Madison); Siddharth Dangwal (IIT Delhi); Moinuddin Qureshi (GT)
“This is both an exciting and disruptive time for computer architecture research as we approach the end of Moore’s law,” said SCS Chair Vivek Sarkar. “It’s great to see this forward-looking research by Georgia Tech faculty and their collaborators being showcased at MICRO.”
Student Achievements Highlight Entrepreneurial Culture
Frustrated by not being able to find a study partner for a looming final exam, computer science (CS) major and budding entrepreneur Malek Amiri knew there had to be an easier way.
“I just wanted a quick way for students to connect with classmates so they could find someone to study with. So, I thought, ‘Ok, this app should be a thing,’” said Amiri, now a third-year CS major.
n fall 2018, Amiri turned this seemingly simple idea into Huddler, a mobile app that lets Georgia Tech students instantly connect with and create study groups for all undergraduate and graduate-level courses.
Although it hasn’t become a startup company quite yet, Huddler is doing well in the App Store, moving toward an Android version, and ready to expand to other universities across the country.
Amiri is one of many students whose recent achievements are highlighting the College’s flourishing entrepreneurial culture.
In fact, whether working individually or as part of a team, CS students are in the entrepreneurial mix across campus. This year’s InVenture Prize at Georgia Tech finals is a good case in point. Of the six finalist teams vying for the grand prize in March, four had members majoring in CS. One team was made up entirely of CS students.
“Computer science has become crucial to advancing science and engineering across the board so it makes sense that there were so many CS majors participating in this year’s finals,” said Monica Sweat, College of Computing senior lecturer and director of the Division of Computing Instruction.
Team Nix, featuring two CS majors, didn’t win the InVenture Prize, but it did earn the People’s Choice award for its e-cigarette device that automatically tapers nicotine levels. Today, Nix is in business and taking pre-orders for its product.
The team got its start in a new section of the junior capstone design course, which the College helped launch in fall 2018. Known as Create-X Capstone Design, the new section is dedicated to entrepreneurial projects that pair CS majors with engineering students to solve problems and potentially start companies. “Not all projects become monetized or mature into a startup,” said Olufisayo Omojokun, GT Computing senior lecturer and College lead for establishing the Create-X Capstone Design section.
“The underlying goal, however, is to foster entrepreneurial confidence within the students so that when they are out in the real world, they’ll have the tools and skills to overcome the initial hurdles of realizing future ideas and solutions.” The new capstone section is one of many resources for students in the Georgia Tech entrepreneurial ecosystem, which includes:
- The Advanced Technology Development
- IPaT Industry Innovation Day/GVU Center Research Showcase
- The Georgia Tech Research Corporation (GTRC)
These, and a host of other resources, are avail able to connect student entrepreneurs with seed funding, peer networks, and technical, business, and commercialization guidance. Perhaps most importantly, these resources help students identify and connect with faculty mentors.
Early in his undergraduate career, Aditya Vishwanath (BS CS 2018) was able to connect with Assistant Professor Neha Kumar and her lab, contributing to a number of projects that bring low-cost virtual reality (VR) education to students around the world.
Following successful projects with school children in Atlanta and Mumbai in 2017, Vishwanath capped off his work at Georgia Tech leading a large-scale validation study to determine the effectiveness of using VR in the classroom.
Nearly 350 Cobb County high school and middle school students participated in the project, which let students explore plant and animal cells from the inside using their smartphones and inexpensive cardboard VR viewers.
Seeing the need and potential firsthand, Vishwanath – now a Knight-Hennessy Scholar at Stanford University – and his partner, Amrutha Vasan (BS ISYE 2018) founded Inspirit, a mobile platform for hosting VR-based learning content for the classroom.
The company is now based in Silicon Valley. It recently earned investor funding and is currently producing 30 additional hours of STEM VR content for its K-12 catalog, which is available by monthly and yearly subscription plans.
“I can’t imagine that I would be where I am
today without having a faculty mentor like Dr. Kumar. Just knowing that I could rely on her experience and expertise was a huge advantage and helped me to better understand where we could take this company,” said Vishwanath
Student Data Science Club Builds Skills, Opportunity for Members
Later this week, Starry Night is coming to Georgia Tech. No, not the Van Gogh painting, the 36-hour student datathon hosted by Data Science at GT (DSGT).
Although it’s not a priceless work of art, Hacklytics 2023: A Starry Night is expected to be an invaluable opportunity for the nearly 650 students participating in the three-day competition – in-person and virtually – to stretch their imaginations to find creative data-driven solutions to real-world challenges.
With Van Gogh’s painting as their inspirational starting point, DSGT leaders decided to take their vision for this year’s Hacklytics a bit further.
“We were really inspired to let it be all about creativity, imagination, and perspective. We extrapolated the Starry Night theme to be about exploration and outer space, which tie into our tracks, our décor, and generally, into the whole vibe of the event,” Krishi Manek, DSGT director of projects and second-year computer science (CS) major.
Hacklytics 2023, which received nearly 1,300 applcations, is sanctioned by Major League Hacking and open to all Georgia Tech students, as well as any university student over the age of 18. Teams will compete for potential internships with top tech companies and $10,000 in tech-gadget prizes.
The event is set for Feb. 10 – 12 in the Klaus Advanced Computing Building atrium and features tracks in sports, healthcare, energy and sustainability, and finance. The challenges for each track are developed by DSGT and the club’s sponsors and industry partners.
[Help make Hacklytics 2023 a success by volunteering today!]
“We ask our sponsors to develop challenges based on their tracks. For example, GT Athletics has brought us projects they are working on around measuring acceleration for the swim team and the track team,” said Shreiyas Saraf, DSGT president.
Far from merely creating theoretical solutions, Hacklytics has a proven track record of inspiring teams to develop tools that make an impact in the real-world. Saraf says that a winning team last year developed a tool that visualizes pitching and can suggest the best pitch to throw in any given situation.
“The project was implemented, and the team members are now on contract with GT Baseball. The year before, a Hacklytics team working on a challenge from Capital One created a credit card fraud analyzer for them that went into development and became something they use today,” said Saraf, who is also a second-year CS major.
Hacklytics is a signature annual event for DSGT, which was established in 2016, but the datathon is not the only event the student-led club organizes each year. Community-focused projects and training bootcamps are also part of how the club is working to advance its membership’s data science skills and experience.
DSGT typically works with startup companies, as well as larger businesses like Accenture, Amazon, and State Farm, for its community projects. It’s also successfully partnered with organizations the Scheller School of Business and CREATE-X at Georgia Tech. These projects are geared to deliver actionable results for the clients and hands-on experience for DSGT members.
To help its members build the skills needed to be successful in these types of data science projects, DSGT organizes training bootcamps each semester. These in-person and online bootcamps offer training opportunities in machine learning basics, popular programming languages, like Python, and data analytics tools, such as Pandas.
“Our club motto is ‘data-science with a focus on community,’ so, to that end, we want all of our events and projects to benefit the broader community and our DSGT community,” said Manek.
Like Hacklytics, DSGT membership is open to all Georgia Tech students. The club had nearly 500 members in Fall 2022 with majors including industrial engineering, computer engineering, computer science, computational science and engineering, mathematics, business, and analytics.
“I honestly think data science is a field that's so applicable to almost every facet of our lives and our club does a great job of introducing data science concepts to students. And then, if they're interested, they can use our club to explore further opportunities with our programs, sponsors, and corporate partners,” said second-year CS major Reshma Gudla, DSGT marketing director.

Student-led Program Helping to Increase Diversity Among Graduate Applicants
Prospective students from minority communities have a new resource when applying to computer science (CS) related Ph.D. programs at Georgia Tech.
The Georgia Tech Graduate Application Support (GT-GAS) program is a student-led organization that matches underrepresented applicants with graduate-student mentors who are enrolled in a CS, human-centered computing (HCC), machine learning, or another CS-related Ph.D. program.
Once matched, the mentors provide feedback on their applicant’s CV and statement of purpose. Mentors also share their experiences to provide better insight into the application process for prospective students. The feedback is provided in writing and may include virtual one-on-one meetings as well.
According to program founder Shirley Anugrah Hayati, a first-year HCC Ph.D. student, several applicant/mentor pairs were matched before the Nov. 15 GT-GAS deadline. The applicants will receive feedback in time for them to meet the upcoming Ph.D. application deadline on Dec. 15.
Hayati says that similar programs exist at other institutions, so she decided to develop this service for Georgia Tech. To help organize an assistance program in the College of Computing, she recruited machine learning Ph.D. student Will Held.
“As a minority in computer science, I can imagine that if I didn’t have mentors or anyone to help with my application, how hard that would have been, so I’m inspired to help underrepresented students in applying for computer science-related Ph.D. programs at Georgia Tech,” said Hayati.
After consulting their faculty advisor, Diyi Yang, assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing, the pair moved forward with the project by developing survey forms for potential applicants and mentors and establishing an implementation timeline for the program.
“GT-GAS is a wonderful initiative by our students that should increase the diversity of graduate education at Georgia Tech. More than 30 Ph.D.’s from the College have joined the program. I am sure there will be more joining next year, and I believe GT-GAS is well on the way to helping more who are in need,” said Yang.
With a successful launch this semester, Hayati hopes to be able to reach more underrepresented applicants in the future and possibly expand the program across campus. As a first step though, she’d like to see the program added to the College website.
“I think bringing this to the College’s official website will help people to find it even earlier so that the applicants have even more time to prepare their applications,” said Hayati.
According to Ann Claycombe, director of communications for the College of Computing, a page with links and information about the GT-GAS program will be added to the College’s newly revamped website next semester.
Student Named as Apple Scholar for Connecting People with Machine Learning
A Georgia Tech Ph.D. student has been selected as an Apple Scholar for work done to ensure machine learning (ML) systems are easy to use and understand for researchers, developers, and everyday end-users.
Zijie Jay Wang is a recipient of the 2023 Apple Scholars in AI/ML PhD fellowship. The fellowship recognizes the success of Wang’s research efforts to make artificial intelligence (AI) and ML systems more transparent and accessible.
As the power and complexity of these systems continue to advance at breakneck speed, his advisor says Wang’s work is vitally important.
“Jay's research connects humans and ML systems. His work on easy-to-use and interactive interfaces is crucial to making ML more interpretable, accessible, and reliable,” said Polo Chau, School of Computational Science and Engineering associate professor.
To help people better connect with these systems, Wang leverages his expertise, not only in ML, but also in data visualization. He’s developed several interactive visualization tools that are designed to help technical and nontechnical people understand deep learning, neural networks, and other ML-related topics. These include:
- CNN Explainer, an open-source tool developed for deep-learning beginners. Since its release in July 2020, more than 180,000 global visitors have used the tool.
- GAM Changer, which empowers users in healthcare, finance, or other domains to edit ML models to include knowledge and values specific to their domain, which improves reliability. This tool won a best paper award at the 2021 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. It has also been integrated into Microsoft's Interoperability Library.
- DiffusionDB, a first-of-its-kind large-scale dataset that lays a foundation to help people better understand generative AI. This work could lead new research in detecting deepfakes and designing human-AI interaction tools to help people more easily use these models.
Building upon his success, Wang has two accepted papers at the upcoming ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.
One of these, GAM Coach: Towards Interactive and User-centered Algorithmic Recourse, describes an interactive ML tool that could be used to help people who have been rejected for a loan by automatically letting an applicant know what’s needed for them to receive loan approval.
The Apple Scholars in AI/ML PhD fellowship program will enable Wang to explore more work like this, as well as more high-risk/high-reward research opportunities.
“It is a tremendous privilege to be awarded this fellowship, and I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with researchers at Apple in my research projects. By partnering with Apple researchers, I believe it will greatly amplify real-world applicability and impacts of my work,” said Wang.
This is not the first time Wang has been recognized with a high-profile fellowship. He was recognized last year as a recipient of the 2022 J.P. Morgan AI Ph.D. Fellowship.

Students Partner with Discovery Education to Develop New AR Education Tool
When it comes to expanding immersive technologies in the classroom, little progress has been made in creating interactive ways for high school students to learn higher-level math.
It’s a problem that three Georgia Tech graduate students studying human-computer interaction (HCI) are addressing by designing a new augmented reality (AR) tool.
What started as a master’s project turned into a potential breakthrough when Doris Amouzou, Madeleine Paulsen, and Tymirra Smith approached Discovery Education with their idea for an AR learning tool for higher-level math subjects such as geometry, trigonometry, and calculus.
Having already developed AR applications such as Sandbox AR and Timepod Adventures, Discovery Education took interest in the idea of enhancing immersive learning for an underserved subject and offered to partner with the group of students.
“The most exciting part of this project is being able to explore something that not only we were curious about, but we found an industry partner that was equally curious, and they’ve been an excellent resource, and they’ve helped guide us,” Paulsen said.
Lisa Katz, vice president of research and analytics at Discovery Education, said the organization’s partnership with the students was a timely one, and it is the first time it has partnered with an HCI program like the one at Georgia Tech.
“Further exploration into content applications of immersive technology in the classroom is top of mind for Discovery Education in 2023,” Katz said. “Through the partnership with Georgia Tech’s HCI program, we collaborated on research protocol development and joint national studies that gathered information on interest and aptitude to use immersive and interactive technology in the classroom.”
Amouzou, Paulsen, and Smith are advised by Carrie Bruce, research scientist at the School of Interactive Computing and assistant director of the MS-HCI program, and Kantwon Rogers, a computer science Ph.D. student and instructor. Their project will map out a design for an AR tool that serves as an accessible and safe space for learning, reduces anxiety, and engages learning interests for complex subjects.
Amouzou said the initial version of the group’s AR tool will be geared toward learning the unit circle, which is a circle with a radius of 1.
“The unit circle is this concept that bridges students into learning higher education math. It’s a concept that teachers have found to be difficult for students to grasp, but it is the foundation to understanding precalculus,” Amouzou said.
To get an idea of how to build the tool for a modern classroom environment, the team worked with public, private, and homeschool student groups in the metro Atlanta area and organized focus groups.
First, the student researchers found that digital resources help teachers close the gaps in student understanding and that geometrically teaching the unit circle helps them better conceptualize it.
While AR learning technologies improve engagement, previous studies show that they’ve struggled to make significant improvements in learning outcomes, a trend that Amouzou said the group would like to break as they design their AR tool.
One reason for that might be because most tools fail to be explainable, Amouzou said. The feedback the researchers received from student interviews and surveys points to a consensus that students prefer to know why the material is being taught. Explaining why students need to learn the unit circle is just as important as teaching how it works.
“It’s very difficult for some people to see math in their own world,” Amouzou said. “But math is everywhere. Maybe our tool can help them see that a bit more and explain how math is all around them.”
The best way to do that has been through incorporating 3D models to teach the concepts, which students said was the most helpful way to understand the material.
“Running these math concepts that are three-dimensional and very visual concepts with a visual tool could be really powerful in helping students gain a deeper understanding,” Paulsen said.
The group also interviewed teachers for their project and found many yearn for supplemental material to support traditional learning methods. According to Discovery Education’s latest annual survey, 66 percent of educators used more supplemental resources than they did in their previous year of teaching.
Some teachers told the group they already use digital tools as either a warm-up method or as homework assignments. But the real hope is to have a tool that will foster independent learning.
“Since this is something that they will also be using in the classroom, getting their insights is important,” Amouzou said. “All the teachers agreed that using digital tools in the classroom helps bridge the gap in student understanding.”
With a foundation for the design in place, the team will share its findings with Discovery Education and hope to see continuing support as they begin the development phase.
“In terms of the life of this project, it’s to be determined, but it’s something that helps them explore the processes they have in place — their design methods, their research methods, and then where they can take it in the future,” Paulsen said.
“Connecting with those leaders and their organization has been a phenomenal way for us to envision what could be next. But that’s up to us with what we design and what they think about our design. We’re excited to see where it could go.”
Students Recognize Two SCP Faculty for Excellence in the Classroom
Two faculty in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP) have been recognized by their students for demonstrating excellence in the classroom through the Annual Course Instructor Opinion Survey (CIOS) Awards.
Assistant Professor Frank Li and Associate Professor Brendan Saltaformaggio both serve jointly with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), where they teach graduate level cybersecurity courses.
Li was recognized by his students from his Empirical Computer Security (ECE/CS8803) course. This class covers measurement and data analysis methods for understanding real-world security and privacy. The class is closely related to his research area and is one Li is personally passionate about.
“I'm certainly thankful for the positive support from my students and I appreciate the recognition from Georgia Tech,” said Li. “I'm proud of this award mainly because it indicates that I've been able to provide a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment in class, which I feel is important for a positive educational experience.”
Students enrolled in Advanced Malware Analysis (ECE/CS 6747) with Saltaformaggio learn the fundamental principles of dissecting malware, finding, and defending against vulnerabilities, and cyberattack triage. The course also prepares students to conduct research in cyberattack forensics and malware analysis.
“Cybersecurity is unlike many other classroom-taught disciplines in that there is little substitute for concrete experience,” said Saltaformaggio. “I have created two new courses, one at the graduate level and one at the undergraduate level, which introduce students to hands-on cyber forensics techniques like cyberattack investigation methodologies, malware reverse engineering, and even legal proceedings.”
The Annual CIOS Awards are given to faculty members and instructors that students rate highly for stimulating interest in the course topic, demonstrating enthusiasm in the classroom, and treating students with respect. Li and Saltaformaggio are among the 50 full time faculty across Georgia Tech chosen to receive the award.
Students Recognized as the Next Generation of Cybersecurity Professionals
Two graduate students from Georgia Tech have been selected by faculty to represent the Institute at the RSA Conference (RSAC) in San Francisco as part of the Security Scholar program at the end of this month.
Dhruv Kuchhal, a Ph.D. student in computer science, and Avani Modak, a Master of Science in Cybersecurity (MS Cybersecurity) student, will join around 50 cybersecurity students from over 40 colleges, universities, and institutions worldwide for a week of networking and learning from leading cybersecurity professionals.
RSAC focuses exclusively on industry jobs and partnerships, making it appealing to Georgia Tech students interested in corporate work. Both Kuchhal and Modak are finishing their degrees this year and hope to make lasting connections while attending the event that will aid in their job search.
Through the Security Scholars program, Kuchhal and Modak will have access to a wide range of perks that include team-building exercises, networking with more than 300 companies at the conference expo, attending an invitation-only dinner with cybersecurity experts, and more.
Kuchhal says he is looking forward to learning what research looks like in a business environment. His work in exposing cracks in web security has given him a unique academic perspective. He hopes to use the tools at RSAC to learn more about how these issues affect the industry.
“I think that is why the conference will be such a good fit for me,” he said. “I want to see what the industry cares about and their approach to a problem. I am excited to meet people and learn what is important to them.”
Modak is attending RSAC for the second time, but this will be her first stint as a Security Scholar.
Her first experience at the conference was when worked for VMware, attending on her own for professional development. It was through her job at the cloud computing company that she realized the importance of cybersecurity. Inspired her to seek out graduate programs in the field, she made her way to the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP).
“The RSA Conference is where the world of cybersecurity gets together,” she said. “After I posted to my LinkedIn that I was going, I had several connections reach out to tell me they would be there, too. It is really cool to see how close this community is.”
Modak was nominated for the Security Scholars program by Professor Peter Swire, J.Z. Liang Chair in SCP. Even though she is in the information security track of her master’s program, Modak has been working with Swire, who is an expert in cybersecurity policy, to study how the physical location of data can influence policy and restrict cybersecurity defense efforts.
“Avani took ownership of key parts of the project, and made a real impact,” said Swire. “Due to her outstanding and creative work, she soon became a co-author on our paper.”
Master’s students at Georgia Tech take classes in three cybersecurity disciplines during the program. While familiar with the good reputation around the Institute's computing courses, Modak wasn’t sure what to expect when she took Swire’s Privacy, Technology, Policy, and Law (PUBP 6726) in Fall 2021.
“The class was something new and something interesting. I think it is a topic software developers need to understand and be more aware of,” she said. “It was so cool to see someone like Professor Swire, who is so active in shaping global cyber policy, take the time to teach me and let me pick his brain.”
The second nominating faculty is Assistant Professor Frank Li, who is Kuchhal’s advisor.
Li has worked with Kuchhal on several research projects spanning web security, abuse, and privacy. A key project was a study of FIDO2, the technology that allows websites to replace login passwords, view fraud on YouTube, and local network communications by websites.
“I nominated Dhruv because he's done cool research looking at real world web security and privacy,” said Li. “Since he is interested in an industry career, participating with the Security Scholar program will help him connect with industry experts.”
Kuchhal has followed Li’s work even before he came to Georgia Tech. The Ph.D. student said his research interests aligned with the SCP assistant professor and Li was his first choice for an advisor.
“There were other faculty I spoke with, but Dr. Li was the person I wanted to work with,” said Kuchhal. “I wouldn’t have had it any other way.”
Students in the US Virgin Islands Participating in Computing Summer Camps
Students in the U.S. Virgin Islands are learning about robotics, video game design, and more this summer as part of an annual computing camp program hosted by the Georgia Tech College of Computing.
The summer camp program has been held on campus for 10 years. This is the first time the College has offered the program outside the continental U.S.
Through a budding partnership with the University of the Virgin Islands, the College is bringing a series of computing camps to students in Saint Thomas and Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Students enrolled in the program are participating in sessions led by live remote facilitators at Georgia Tech.
Each of the week-long day camps has a different computing-related focus. These include:
- Ear sketch – Students learn to make their own beats and learn the role computers play in music production
- Pixel box – Students learn to program a light field to create pictures of their choosing
- 2D & 3D Printing – Students learn to design and print t-shirts or tote bags. They also learn to 3D-print luggage tags, puzzle, and more
- Video game design – Students learn to build a basic game like pong or space invaders
- Robotics – Students learn to program robots to either follow a line or sense distance
The new live-instruction/remote-participation model allows one teacher to reach students in multiple locations. Onsite teaching assistants support the students, which helps to maximize the program’s impact.
The summer camp program, which is managed by the College’s Constellations Center for Equity in Computing, shifted to live online instruction during the pandemic.
“We didn’t want to lose the momentum we had gained over the previous decade. More importantly, we didn’t want to miss an opportunity to expose more students to the creative side of computing,” said Cedric Stalworth, Constellations program director.
To meet this challenge, the Constellation team began developing a remote model for the summer camp program in 2021.
“Our reach has expanded with new partnerships with a school district in Jefferson, Georgia and a community space — Mt. Zion Church — in Albany, Georgia. Our new model of using a live virtual instructor and having students meet in a location of their choice is working really well,” said Yolanda Payne, a Constellations fellow.
The new approach worked so well in Jefferson and Albany that the Constellations team recognized they could reach students regardless of their location.
The Constellations outreach team travelled to the USVI earlier this month to set up the camps. This included training the teaching assistants and delivering all the required materials.
Students Working with Real-World Clients to Create Software-based Solutions
Computer science (CS) students at Georgia Tech are using technology to help feed displaced refugees in Cameroon. They are also assisting Atlanta-area single parents in connecting with local family resources.
These are just two of the 35 software design projects that are being developed for actual clients and debuting this month at the Fall 2021 CS Junior Design Capstone (CS JDC) Expo.
The expo is a bi-annual showcase of projects completed by third- and fourth-year CS and Computational Media (CM) students as part of the two-semester CS JDC course in the College of Computing.
The expo, which began in 2017, is set for today and Monday in the Klaus Advanced Computing Building Atrium.
Along with building their software skills, students in the course also develop technical communication skills by interacting with actual clients from area corporate and nonprofit organizations. They work with clients to create software-based solutions to real issues impacting an organization and its customers. These solutions, which are produced to a minimally viable product level, often include web and mobile apps, websites, and scheduling tools.
“We’re really looking for software development projects that require a front end (user interface) and a back end (software, app, server). Because the projects are so different, the work products can be very different as well,” said Amanda Girard, course coordinator for the CS JDC program. “However, the students are learning a process; they are learning what steps are consistently required when working with industry to get something done.”
During the first semester of the course, students learn about the user design process and focus more on technical communication. Part of this includes conducting user research and incorporating the findings into the tool or platform the teams are developing.
In the case of Amba Farmers Voice, students are creating a mobile app to ensure farmers and refugees in southern Cameroon have access to agricultural education resources to help increase food production. Similarly, students working for Atlanta-based nonprofit It Takes a Village are harnessing the power of mobile technology to help single parents find childcare, tutors, local food producers, and more in Atlanta’s West End community.
“In the first semester, the deliverables are based on what’s expected in industry – vision statements, user stories, user mapping, and recommendation reports. And rather than a textbook, we use a popular user design manual from industry,” said Girard, who is an instructor in the College of Computing’s Division of Computing Instruction (DCI).
The second semester of the CS JDC program is more CS-heavy, says Girard, and segmented into five three-week long “coding sprints.” During this time, the student teams send demo videos along with technical and recommendation reports to their clients. This back-and-forth helps the students learn how to get client feedback and how to talk to clients in a way that they understand.
“One team said, ‘Oh, our client is asking about using machine learning. That can be difficult. Do they even know what they’re asking for?’ I said, ‘Exactly, they’re the client and you’re the expert. You need to not only understand what a client wants, but often you also need to help a client better understand what it is they are asking for,’” said Girard.
The focus on industry engagement and real-world experience stems from a survey of the College’s alumni from nearly a decade ago. The survey revealed that at that time, many alumni felt unprepared for the technical communication aspects of their jobs following graduation.
“They reported that they didn’t fully realize how much client communication would be needed in the real world and just how much report and documentation writing was involved on a regular basis when working in industry,” said Girard.
To meet this need, DCI Instructor Bob Waters, now retired, worked with Georgia Tech’s Writing and Communications program to retool and expand the existing one-semester capstone course.
Launched nearly nine years ago, the updated two-semester CS Junior Design Capstone course was co-taught by DCI instructors and Marion L. Brittain Fellows. It paired a 3000-level technical communication course tailored for CS majors with existing client-based/student-proposed projects.
The expanded course has been a success according to Girard, who started co-teaching the course as a Brittain Fellow. The first cohort had just 50 students. Today, nearly 600 CS and CM students are enrolled in 10 sections of the CS JDC course, which currently serves about 100 external clients.
Girard became the first permanent CS JDC program coordinator when the College added the position in 2018. Prior to joining the DCI team and working as a Brittain Fellow, Girard earned her Ph.D. in Rhetoric, Theory, and Culture from Michigan Technological University.

Study Seeks to Bring More Diverse Voices into Computing Ethics Education
A new study funded by the National Science Foundation is examining the existing computer science ethics curriculum to discover ways of ensuring diversity and inclusivity. Charles Isbell, dean of computing at Georgia Tech, and School of Computer Science Professor Ellen Zegura are co-principal investigators for the three-year, near $400,000 project.
Summer Class Joins Alumni Cohort
Many School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) students slogged through the dog days of summer defending theses and dissertations to complete their degrees. As of Aug. 12, the degree confirmation date for summer graduates, these students can now call themselves alumni of Georgia Tech.
“Our students’ success is not only important to Georgia Tech, but also to the field of CSE,” said Haesun Park, Regents’ Professor and chair of the School of CSE. “Our faculty and staff strive to provide the best environment where each student can flourish to one’s maximum potential.”
Five School of CSE students received their doctoral degrees this summer. They are:
- Siddharth Biswal (Ph.D. CS 22) advised by School of CSE Adjunct Professor Jimeng Sun
- Rahul Duggal (Ph.D. CS 22) advised by School of CSE Associate Professor Polo Chau
- Srinivas Eswar (Ph.D. CS 22) advised by Park and Professor Rich Vuduc
- Ali Siahkoohi (Ph.D. CSE 22) advised by School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and School of CSE Professor Felix Herrmann
- Haowen Zhang (Ph.D. CSE 22) advised by School of CSE Professor Srinivas Aluru
Along with the five Ph.D. graduates, two students completed their Master of Science in Computational Science and Engineering degrees. New School of CSE MS alumni are:
- Fu Shen (MS CSE-CSE 22)
- Brandon Whitchurch (MS CSE-CSE 22)
Two other School of CSE students completed their master’s degrees as part of their doctoral degree track. They are:
- Dongjin Choi (MS CSE-CSE 22) advised by Park
- Shahrokh Shahi (MS CSE-CSE 22) advised by School of CSE Associate Professor Elizabeth Cherry
“Our graduates do extremely well by attaining high demand positions at national labs, industry, government agencies, and faculty at academic institutions,” Park said. “These graduates will lead and carry out the vision and mission of the CSE academic field.”
Surveyed Alumni Nearly Unanimous in Saying OMSCS Program Worth the Investment
As incredible as it sounds, enrollment in Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program has skyrocketed by nearly 3,000% since it launched in January 2014 with just 380 students.
The OMSCS program now has more than 8,600 alumni and nearly 11,500 current students. As any business major can tell you, this level of growth can lead to quality control issues for any organization.
One of the ways OMSCS program administrators help to maintain a high level of quality is through surveys. Incoming students and new graduates are surveyed each year to ensure the program continues to meet the needs of current and future students.
“Surveys allow us to measure our growth, outreach, and any possible gaps we should address. They also allow us to measure the program’s impact, which informs our vision for the future,” said Ana Rusch, OMSCS associate director of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Student Life in the College of Computing.
In 2022, more than 2,200 people from around the world graduated with an OMSCS degree from Georgia Tech.
International students are well represented in this group, making up one third of these new alumni. Women and people from underrepresented minority groups accounted for nearly 30% of program graduates last year.

As diverse as these new alumni are, there are some things they almost all have in common. Nearly all of them, 95%, found OMSCS to be worth the investment. A slightly higher percentage, 96%, said that they would recommend the program to others.
The findings are part of the 2022 exit survey of OMSCS graduates.
Of those participating in the survey, more than 80% said that OMSCS has aided them in their career. More than half of respondents, 55%, said they had started a new job since completing OMSCS, while 38% reported being promoted in their current workplace. Nearly half, 48%, said OMSCS helped them to secure a higher salary.
The exit survey also revealed that a small, but significant, percentage of respondents have used their experience to springboard into new careers. With their OMSCS degree in hand, 8% of respondents have started teaching computer science at the K-12 or college level, and 7% have transitioned to the tech sector.

The results of the Fall 2022 entrance survey are in line with the findings from the new alumni survey, an indicator that the program is well aligned toward students’ goals.
"The surveys ensure that our students' voices are at the center of OMSCS. They also give students a low-stakes place to share their thoughts, which are super valuable to us as program administrators," said Rusch.
The survey of 1,206 new OMSCS students found that 75% of respondents enrolled in the program as a step to help advance their careers, while 47% reported seeking higher salaries. Nearly 4 out of 10 want to transition to new careers through the program.
The survey indicated that the average age of survey respondents was 30 years old, and 22% of respondents were women. Almost 86% of those taking part in the survey work full-time. Slightly less than 30% of the new students have a prior master’s degree, and just 6% hold Ph.D. degrees.
Swire to Continue Defining the Field of Cybersecurity as J.Z. Liang Chair
The College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology is pleased to announce that Peter Swire has been named the J.Z. Liang Chair in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP). Swire previously held the Elizabeth and Tommy Holder Chair of Law and Ethics in the Scheller College of Business.
“I am honored by this announcement,” Swire said. “Throughout my career in privacy and cybersecurity, I have worked at the intersection of computing, law, and public policy. With this Chair, I look forward to supporting the inter-disciplinary vision of the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy.”
Prior to joining Georgia Tech in 2013, Swire was a professor of law at the Ohio State University, George Washington University, and the University of Virginia. Under President Clinton, he served as Chief Counselor for Privacy in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the first person to have U.S. government-wide responsibility for privacy policy. After the Snowden revelations, he served as one of five members of President Obama’s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology, which recommended changes to U.S. surveillance laws that have since been adopted into U.S. legislation.
While trained as a lawyer Swire has long worked on computing topics. He served for two terms on the Forum on Cyber-Resiliency of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, and this year completed work as a co-author of NASEM’s new report on “Cryptography and the Intelligence Community: The Future of Encryption.”
In 2012, Swire was named global co-chair of the Do Not Track standards process, of the World Wide Web Consortium. His earlier work included serving in 1999 as Chair of the White House Working Group on Encryption, which resulted in policy changes to permit the export of strong encryption from the United States.
“As Computing expands into more and more fields, we need scholars like Peter who can cross the bridge between technical and legal problems,” said Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay, Jr. chair of computing. “We are very pleased to have him as part of the School of Security and Privacy, and for him to hold the J.Z. Liang Chair. He is helping us define the future of cybersecurity as a field.”
“James” Jian Zhang Liang (ICS ’90, MS ICS ’91) was the co-founder and CEO of trip.com, a provider of travel services. He currently teaches as an Applied Professor of Applied Economics at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management.
SCP is Georgia Tech’s home for research and education in cybersecurity and privacy. SCP draws skilled cybersecurity professionals from technology, policy, business, and practical fields to meet a rising national and international demand. Housed within the nationally ranked College of Computing, this new school builds on Georgia Tech’s 20-year investment to further develop the research and education of cybersecurity and privacy.
“We are incredibly proud of Peter and are very excited to see his work recognized in this way,” said Michael Bailey, inaugural chair of the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy. “At SCP we believe everyone should share in the economic prosperity and social progress enabled by technology. Ensuring the Cybersecurity and Privacy of these systems in society is a grand challenge that requires fundamentally new approaches. Peter’s long history of innovative work at the intersection of law and technology is a great example of SCP faculty rising to meet this grand challenge.”
Team Advances in $1 Million XPRIZE Digital Learning Challenge
The Georgia Tech research team behind the world’s first AI-powered virtual ecological research assistant, is one step closer to participating in a $1 million prize purse.
The XPRIZE Foundation announced this week that team Veritas, led by College of Computing Professor Ashok Goel, is moving forward as a top-ten team to the penultimate round of the $1 Million XPRIZE Digital Learning Challenge.
The competition started with nearly 300 teams vying for a top prize of $500,000 with projects geared toward advancing how effective learning tools and processes for improving outcomes are identified.
“By harnessing the energy and creativity of developers, engineers, data scientists, and education researchers, this competition will dramatically improve data collection and analysis of learning outcomes, which will create a new era in education,” said Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer, XPRIZE chief prize operations officer.
VERA is an AI-powered research assistant – connected to the Smithsonian Institution’s Encyclopedia of Life database – within a virtual laboratory. It gives learners of all ages the ability to construct conceptual models of ecological phenomena. Learners can then run interactive agent-based simulations of the models.
“VERA empowers learners to use large-scale domain knowledge to explore ecological systems and perform ‘what if’ experiments to either explain an existing ecological system or predict the outcomes of changes to one. In addition, VERA enables researchers to conduct A/B experiments and supports them in analyzing the data,” explained Goel who is the director of the Design & Intelligence Laboratory.
For the Pilot Phase of the competition, the 10 top teams will conduct trial and subsequent replication studies to demonstrate their platforms. For the Veritas team this means introducing VERA into multiple Georgia Tech classes. These include a new Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) class on cognitive science with geographically distributed online students as well as an undergraduate on-campus biology class.
The goal is “to demonstrate that VERA supports learning in a variety of educational contexts. In addition, we are conducting detailed data analysis to show that VERA supports transfer learning,” said Goel.
Along with Goel, the Veritas team comprises Georgia Tech faculty, staff, and students including:
- Sungeun An, Human-Center Computing Ph.D. student
- OMSCS students Scott Bunin, Willventchy Celestin, and Andrew Hornback
- Stephen Buckley, computer science major
- Vrinda Nandan, research scientist
- Emily Weigel, senior academic professional in the School of Biological Sciences
College of Computing senior research scientist Spencer Rugaber and Jennifer Hammock, a project manager with the Smithsonian Institution serve as internal and external advisors for the team.
Team Earns Top CS Capstone Honor for Medical App
Student teams presented their software design projects to compete at the Computer Science Junior Design Capstone (CS JDC) Expo on April 24 at the Exhibition Hall.
Each semester, third- and fourth-year CS and computational media (CM) students work with clients to solve various real-world problems with their software designs. Students produce minimally viable products, like mobile apps, for public and private sector clients.
More than 50 teams presented projects at the expo. They were judged on their product’s functionality and aesthetic as well as their presentation.
The top three teams in the Spring 2023 CS JDC Expo are:

Team Earns Top CS Capstone Honors for Its Update of a Suicide Prevention App
Each semester, student teams put their software design skills to the test vying for top honors in the Computer Science Junior Design Capstone (CS JDC) Expo. This semester is no exception.
More than 30 teams presented projects during the live expo held on Dec. 5 in the Klaus Advanced Computing Building. The teams were made up of of third- and fourth-year CS and computational media (CM) student.
The top three teams in the Fall 2022 CS JDC Expo are:
- 1st Place: ReliefLink – The ReliefLink project is a reboot of an award-winning suicide prevention app. The team is adding features, giving the app a modern design, and adding iOS support. The team members were Alexandr Shor, Daniel Young, Yuting Shen, Eduardo Emilio Costa Trunci, Rithvik Rajavelu, and Suvan Adhikari.
- 2nd Place: eKlozet – The eKlozet mobile app curates personalized outfit recommendations for users based on an initial fashion preference screening quiz. Users manage their closet virtually and select outfits days in advance with linked calendar and weather capabilities. The team members were Sreya Atmuri, Shonjoy Bhattacharyya, Allison Fain, Mija Kennedy, Olivia Mauger, and Nelson Rodriguez.
- 3rd Place: ChickSafe – ChickSafe is an application that provides helpful visual data and reports to farmers regarding the development and acclimation of their broiler chickens shortly after they arrive at the broiler houses.The team members were Meena Ajith, Chris Antley, Ethan Boone, Manivannan Nilesh, Sahil Sudhir, and Akash Veerappan.
The expo is the culmination of a two-semester course in the School of Computing Instruction (SCI) that connects students with public and private sector clients to create software design solutions for real-world challenges.
Along with building software design skills, students in the course develop technical communication skills by interacting with actual clients from area corporate and nonprofit organizations. They work with clients to create software-based solutions to real issues impacting an organization and its customers.
These solutions, which are produced to a minimally viable product level, often include web and mobile apps, websites, and scheduling tools.
Tech Designed to Help Assistive Robots Work More Closely with Patients
Artificially intelligent (AI) systems are continuously improving their understanding of physical human activities such as running, jumping, and biking. Yet, much of people’s lives are spent resting in bed.
Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Stanford University have developed an AI-enabled smart bed and synthetic data set to study people at rest. The data set and smart bed are aimed at improving assistive robotics capabilities for people with disabilities, older adults, or hospital patients where people often require assistance in bed.
Tennis Robot Could Pave Way for Advancement in Fast-Movement Robotics
Matthew Gombolay sees a future for human-scale robots in sports and athletic training.
He imagines robots that can test the skills of professional athletes as well as novices looking to learn a new sport. His latest invention may serve as the touchstone to getting there.
Gombolay grew up playing a variety of sports, but none appealed to him more than tennis. He said he had been playing with the idea of constructing a tennis robot that could go beyond training against a stationary ball feeder to help a player improve his skills.
What if he could have a tennis partner that could play with or against him any time he wanted and could help him improve the weakest areas of his game or complement him in a doubles match?
“Right now, you use ball machines to hit balls of various spin speeds and locations that can emulate what a match might look like,” Gombolay said. “But that’s very different than accounting for an opponent moving across the courts who is going to be hitting from different positions and with different capabilities in shot selection.”
But what would be the best way to create a robot that could simulate a human opponent? He found the answer in one of the sport’s offshoots — wheelchair tennis.
A rapidly growing sport, wheelchair tennis now has its own professional league and is played at all four Grand Slam tournaments as well as the Summer Paralympics.
“We bought a wheelchair that’s designed for wheelchair tennis because I thought bi-pedal locomotion was a little beyond us at this point,” Gombolay said. “If we had an Atlas robot stomping around on the court, we would damage the court.”
An associate professor of robotics in the School of Interactive Computing, Gombolay has spent the past two years building his passion project. It’s called ESTHER — a wheelchair tennis robot that has a tennis racket connected to a single arm. It can cover both sides of the court and could potentially change how robotics can enhance athletic training and performance.
“What really excites me is that it could be a partner for me one day,” Gombolay said. “It can also be my opponent. It can help me train. I could have it pretend to be the one guy I always lose to because he can exploit this weakness in my game.
“Training against an opponent is psychologically more stressful. Getting closer to simulating real match conditions can help you improve performance.”
ESTHER stands for Experimental Sport Tennis Wheelchair Robot, and its name is a homage to renowned wheelchair tennis player Esther Vergeer. Vergeer held the world No. 1 ranking in women’s wheelchair tennis from 1999 to when she retired in 2013, winning 48 major titles and seven Paralympic gold medals. She was 695-25 in singles matches over her career.
ESTHER is nowhere close to the skill level of the player its namesake, but building a human-scale robot that can hit a return is a novel achievement.
Working with more than 20 students, Gombolay authored a paper on building ESTHER, which was accepted to be published in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Robotics & Automation Society’s Automation Letters (IEEE RA-L). The team reached a breakthrough late last year when they successfully and consistently programmed ESTHER to locate the tennis ball coming toward it, and to hit a return.
“It took us about two years to get to that point because nobody's done this before,” Gombolay said. “We built this up from the ground up. Developing that capability was truly exciting.”
ESTHER is powered by two DC motors connected to a gearbox, giving it the quick burst it needs to roll from one side of the court to the other.
“Getting to the ball is not the problem,” Gombolay said. “The problem is knowing where to go. You have to know so far in advance to figure out where the robot should go. There are some problems for us in pathfinding — both deciding where to intercept the ball and what path to get there and being able to follow that trajectory with the robot.”
Gombolay and his team arranged a network of high-resolution cameras around a tennis court and used computer vision algorithms to help ESTHER recognize an incoming tennis ball. The team uses an orange tennis ball because a yellow or green ball can easily get lost among the colors of the court and other surrounding objects.
“When we use cameras from different angles, we can triangulate where the ball is in space,” said Nathaniel Belles, a master’s student in robotics who works on Gombolay’s team. “And once we have enough samples, over time, we can use that position of the ball and see what the trajectory of the ball is, where the arc is going, and where it’s going to end up.”
While Gombolay and his team have a long-term vision for ESTHER, it’s a project full of baby steps. The team is now working toward making ESTHER capable of hitting a back-and-forth rally.
Once it can do that, the next phase would be teaching it how to strategize its shot selection.
“We’re working on important modifications like control methods to control where a robot will go,” Gombolay said. “We’re using reinforcement learning methods so that the robot can learn by itself to get better at where it should go and how it should hit the ball. It should start getting more aggressive and thinking about how it wants to hit the ball and where it wants to hit the ball to win the game.”
If it can reach that point, the goal of revolutionizing the way athletes prepare and train could be within reach.
“From a training perspective, a system like this could one day help you to play or practice against your opponent, the robot playing as your opponent, adopting the same hitting strategies or tactics without you ever having to actually go and play that opponent,” Gombolay said. “After you’ve honed your game against your opponent, then you can go play and hopefully win.”
Zulfiqar Zaidi, one of the lead students on the project, said the benefits of ESTHER’s technology could expand beyond tennis.
“While tennis is a great starting point, a system that can play tennis well can have applications in other fields that similarly require fast dynamic movements, accurate perception, and the ability to safely move around humans,” Zaidi said. “This technology could be useful in manufacturing, construction, or any other field that requires a robot to interact with humans while performing fast and precise movements.
“The ability to plan and strategize well ahead of time is critical for successful performance in both tennis and other fields. A system that can do this effectively for tennis can also be applied to other scenarios where it is necessary to consider the effect of the current action on the future state of the system.”
Third Annual CS Professional Development Summit Looks to Inspire Educators
The Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech is hosting its third annual Computer Science Professional Development Summit.
The virtual summit is being held June 21 – 22. Constellations holds professional development events for teachers several times a year as part of its mission to increase access to computer science (CS) education across the state and nation.
To provide teachers with the most cutting-edge information, research, and perspectives on CS education, leading practitioners and experts in CS education are participating in the summit.
Authors Jane Margolis and Jean Ryoo are the keynote speakers for day one of the summit. The women recently co-authored a graphic novel written that advocates for equity in CS called Power On! Margolis and Ryoo will share best practices for creating equity in the classroom and cutting-edge tools to assist with teaching CS.
Day two will include a keynote presentation by Michelle Harris focusing on instructional coaching and fostering an equitable coaching environment.
On top of the amazing keynote speakers the summit will also include interdisciplinary panel discussions. These experts will talk about topics at the intersection of CS and K-12 education, including cybersecurity, data integration, and artificial intelligence.
The theme for this year’s event is Inspire, Connect, and Empower.
“We hope to inspire educators by providing opportunities to connect with their peers, share resources, and thrive in each other’s successes. The summit aims to empower teachers to lead the next generation of leaders, address complex challenges, and change their world.
“Our goals for the summit remain the same – to support and care for our teachers by building a compassionate and unified community of educators who are the central figures for the youth of our nation,” said Lien Diaz, senior research associate for Constellations.

The panel will feature thought leaders from higher education and the industry, including Charles Isbell, dean of Computing at Georgia Tech and a ML@GT faculty member. Isbell will be joined by Georgia Tech alumnus Rapha Gontijo Lopes, co-founder of Queer in AI, organizer of Radical AI and AI resident at Google Brain, as well as Tiffany Deng, program management lead for machine learning fairness and responsible artificial intelligence (AI) at Google. The panel will be moderated by ML@GT Associate Director Deven Desai.
Through Another's Eyes: University Researchers, Facebook Release Massive Dataset to Expand Innovation in AI
Imagine a collection of assistive technologies that could help a user learn a new skill, assist an elder individual with a task around the home, or help detect autism in early childhood. There exists an endless list of possibilities where artificial intelligence could impact humanity, but to do so it must see the world as we do -- in the first person.
A consortium of universities brought together by Facebook AI, including Georgia Tech, has collaborated to compile the largest dataset ever collected on egocentric computer vision -- or computer vision from the first-person point of view. With enormous application in the space of artificial intelligence and robotics, the project – called Ego4D – will inform and expand foundational research into assistive technologies that impact users at home, in health care, and beyond.
“At this point, we’re nowhere near being able to make functional assistants, but that’s what this dataset is motivated by,” said School of Interactive Computing Professor Jim Rehg, the leader of Georgia Tech’s team of researchers and the social benchmark team within the consortium. “We want to create capabilities to help people in their daily lives, and this is fundamental research in computer vision leading toward that goal.”
Egocentric vision is a specific field of research that analyzes video captured from body-worn cameras. Rehg and his Georgia Tech colleagues have long been leaders in this space, collecting an influential dataset on activity recognition and developing gaze measurement technologies for autism research.
Much of the early detection of autism is predicated on analyzing non-verbal communication in young children. Using body-worn cameras allows researchers to capture and examine video of social interactions in real-world settings.
“It’s much more convenient if you can tell a parent to wear this when they interact with their child for 20 or 30 minutes a day and then put it away,” Rehg said. “It’s not capturing aspects of your life you don’t want to share, it’s not in a lab setting. It’s much more natural.”
The problem for creating technological solutions to real-world challenges in health care or assistive technology, however, has been the inability of individual researchers to capture the kind of large-scale diverse datasets needed to train systems that can work for people of different needs, backgrounds, or cultures. Past datasets have been too small and tended to be from specific kinds of settings in the United States.
Rehg, along with researchers at peer institutions, decided to fill this gap by working together. The result has been much more widespread data collection, especially in locations like Africa, India, Saudi Arabia, and others around the world.
“All these things have come together in the creation of this dataset that we’ll be able to share with the research community,” Rehg said.
The dataset, which will be released in November, was collected by 13 universities and labs across nine countries and contains more than 2,200 hours of first-person video. It presents a diverse mixture of tasks around interaction with objects – cooking, gardening, construction, or knitting for example – and people interacting with their environment by manipulating objects to create things.
The idea is that with enough data, algorithms that can assist or predict needs on everyday tasks could then be developed.
“Imagine folks who are vision impaired, for example,” Rehg said. “They might not have the ability to see exactly what is happening, but if a system knew what you were trying to do it could possibly alert you to things that might be relevant. For example, if you’re mowing your grass it will know that you don’t want to collide with trees or run over things that are harmful to the mower.”
Georgia Tech’s interest in this space aligns with the focus on health-related applications. Rehg provided one example of potentially helping individuals with hearing impairments by developing hearing aids with the assistance of AI to improve selective attention.
“Often hearing aids just amplify all the noises in an environment, including those in the background,” Rehg said. “Imagine if AI could help provide some tuning on that through an agent that understands social interactions – when someone is looking at you, when they are talking to you.”
These collaborations between computer vision and researchers in other spaces, like health, are vital to solving many challenges individuals face in their daily lives, Rehg said.
Partners in the consortium include researchers at IIIT Hyderabad, Indiana University, University of Bristol, University of Catania, Facebook AI, KAUST, Carnegie Mellon and its campus in Africa, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Minnesota, University of Tokyo, University of Pennsylvania, National University of Singapore, and the University of Los Andes.
In addition to Rehg at Georgia Tech are Ph.D. students Fiona Ryan (School of Interactive Computing) and Miao Liu (School of Electrical and Computer Engineering), master’s student Wenqi Jia (College of Computing), lab manager Audrey Southerland, and research scientist Jeffrey Valdez.
Top-Ranked Online Courses Reaching Students from Around the World
Although it’s been a school for less than a month, the School of Computing Instruction (SCI) is already contributing to Georgia Tech’s goal of building a global learning network.
In fact, three courses taught by School faculty were recently ranked as among the Top 10 Best Courses to Take for 2022 in their respective subject matters by global users of Class Central, a search engine for online educational resources.
The three courses are free and among dozens of massively open online courses (MOOCs) and programs Georgia Tech offers via GTx. The three courses ranked in the top 10 for:
- Best Java Courses
- Best Data Structures & Algorithms Courses
- Best Free Programming Courses
“I'm very proud of our team for all the hard work and intentionality that was put into creating the suite of courses,” said Olufisayo Omojokun, School of Computing Instruction (SCI) inaugural chair.
To make its rankings, Class Central relies on subject matter experts and experienced online learners to analyzes user ratings, reviews, and course bookmarks from its more than 100,000 course listings.
“These rankings are based on evaluations of several MOOCs from other top-tier institutions, so they certainly affirm the world-class level of instruction offered by these courses, and more generally, SCI faculty,” said Omojokun, whose Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java I recently began its second year and is ranked #4 for Best Java Courses.
Omojokun’s course, CS 1331, was also recognized as one of Class Central’s 100 most popular free online courses of 2021. More than 13,000 students around the world have taken this entry-level course.
SCI Interim Associate Chair Mary Hudachek-Buswell’s Data Structures & Algorithms I (CS 1332), also in its second year of being offered, ranked #5 for Best Data Structure & Algorithms Courses. Along with making the top 10 in this category, Hudachek-Buswell’s course is also on Class Central’s list of the 100 most popular free online courses for 2022.
At #2 in Best Free Programming Courses is David Joyner’s Computing in Python I: Fundamentals and Procedural Programming (CS 1301), which has been offered for six years. Joyner, College of Computing executive director of online education and Georgia Tech's Online Master of Science in Computer Science program, has a courtesy faculty appointment with SCI. His introductory course is part of a certification program for Python professionals and has:
- More than 208,000 enrollments
- 13,600+ bookmarks
- 4.8 out of 5-star rating on Class Central based on several hundred reviews
Omojokun says that online learners in nearly 150 countries have taken these courses and others offered via GTx. The GTx platform is a partnership with Edx and offers online access to required and elective courses for Georgia Tech students, as well as students around the world.
“A big part of Georgia Tech’s strategic plan for 2020-2030 is to continue connecting globally. Creating quality MOOCs like these furthers this plan.”
“And by making them free, we remove the oftentimes substantial barrier of cost that can stand in the way of obtaining a world-class education in programming, data structures, and algorithms,” said Omojokun.
The College announced in August the elevation of it’s long-standing Division of Computing Instruction to school level. The School of Computing Instruction has 20 full-time and five part-time lecturers who teach all 1000- and 2000- courses, as well as some upper division courses.
Trailblazing Regents' Professor Chronicled Computing in Communist Countries, Now Creating Cyber Curriculum
On the third floor of the Habersham Building, home of the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, sits an office that could almost be mistaken for a museum.
Inside, Regents’ Professor Seymour Goodman sits surrounded by the mementos and artifacts he collected while researching computing from around the world. Goodman visited all seven continents before coming to Georgia Tech in 2000, and despite an academic career of more than 60 years at eight R1 research institutions, he says he won’t retire until he has finished one final project.
“Here I am, maybe not for much longer, but I am determined to see the curriculum for the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP) through,” said Goodman. “Everyone here is building a career and I am dismantling one.”
The twice reappointed Regents’ Professor joined SCP when it was founded in 2020 with the goal of taking Georgia Tech’s existing Master of Science in Cybersecurity (MS Cybersecurity) and expanding it to fit the interdisciplinary scope of the new school. Additionally, Goodman is determined to create a cybersecurity undergraduate thread in the College of Computing.
However, it is a long and difficult road to get any course or curriculum approved. Goodman must find the common ground between computing, engineering, and policy topics along with their students and faculty. Over the next two years, the school anticipates creating more than a dozen new courses and at least one additional undergraduate thread.
“We must serve what we expect to be great demand among the large and growing undergraduate and master’s student populations in the College of Computing and elsewhere in Georgia Tech,” Goodman said. “This is particularly challenging since we see the school and cybersecurity in an interdisciplinary light.”
There is no blueprint for a cybersecurity school like this, but this isn’t Goodman’s first time spearheading a one-of-a-kind project. In fact, he has built his entire career around it.
In the early 1970’s, researchers in the United States had little to no knowledge of the work being done by computer scientists in communist countries and many assumed there was nothing worth studying. Goodman recalled one colleague claim that computing in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was completely stifled by its authoritarian government. Goodman decided to spend the next 17 years personally studying of the development, diffusion, and absorption of computing in communist countries.
“This effort started in 1975 as an outgrowth in my interest in Soviet science and scientists who were important to my Ph.D. dissertation,” said Goodman. “Our research took us to every communist country except Albania and North Korea.”
Technically, Goodman did set foot on North Korean soil, but he doesn’t count that as an actual visit. As Goodman and his Ph.D. students traveled from country to country, they observed the progress and problems of Soviet computing. The project came to a natural conclusion when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, which Goodman witnessed first-hand.
“I was part of the last US National Academy of Sciences delegation hosted by the Soviet Academy of Sciences,” he said. “While we were there, we became the first to be hosted by the new Russian Academy of Sciences.”
Shortly after starting the multi-year research effort into computing, Goodman decided to start another one, but this time he and his students would study the global diffusion of the internet. Following the closure of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) in 1990, computer scientists were at odds over how to expand and implement a similar network for the public.
The consensus at the time was that this computer network, what would become the internet, would only be available to a handful of countries by 2000. Goodman’s estimate, however, was much higher. He believed the internet would be in 60 countries by the end of the century. He was off by a factor of three.
Goodman, then a professor at Stanford University, grabbed his passport once again and traveled around the world to research a unique problem. He and his students were looking for resources that could support an internet infrastructure.
“We were looking to see if they had computers and electricity,” said Goodman. “In 1993, computing was being invested in by the U.S. Department of Defense and technology accessibility was a big deal at Stanford.”
During 1989 and 1990 Goodman visited over 50 countries, specifically developing countries believed to be a lost cause for internet access by researchers at the time. In his 1994 paper, The Global Diffusion of the Internet: Patterns and Problems, Goodman argued that despite the rapidly growing number of internet users, less wealthy countries and individuals were being left behind when it came to internet accessibility.
Again, the project came to a natural end when the internet and cellular technology found its way into every country and territory on the planet by the end of the 2000’s. Their last concentrated effort focused on the continent of Africa and included efforts to bring cybersecurity to countries who were just getting extensively networked. Both projects took Goodman to over 100 countries and to all seven continents.
“I saw an early need for internet security,” said Goodman. “I was brought to the College of Computing at Georgia Tech by our first dean, Peter Freeman, in 2000 because of my background with information security and critical infrastructure.”
Today, Goodman serves jointly in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy and Sam Nunn School of International Affairs where he studies international developments in information technologies and their related public policy issues. Throughout his career he has published over 150 papers and has served on almost every kind of committee imaginable.
But his work is far from over. Goodman has a vision for the cybersecurity curriculum at Georgia Tech that not only includes a revitalized master’s program and new undergraduate thread, but an interdisciplinary cybersecurity curriculum that can be implemented across the Institute as well.
“I believe it is our obligation as a school to get this done,” said Goodman. “This is my current and final concern with computing at Georgia Tech.”
The School of Cybersecurity and Privacy, one of five schools in the top ten ranked College of Computing, was formed in September 2020. It builds on the strong foundation and continued success of the cybersecurity research, education, and service efforts at Georgia Tech that began more than twenty years ago.
The school’s work is both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary. Many current faculty have joint appointments with other schools in the College of Computing, as well as with the School of Computational Science and Engineering within the College of Engineering, the Scheller College of Business, the School of Public Policy, and the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, both in the Ivan Allen College of the Liberal Arts.
Two Courses Created at Georgia Tech Rank in Top Two Percent
More than 2,900 new free online courses debuted in 2021 — and two of the most popular are taught by faculty in the College of Computing.
Mary Hudachek-Buswell and Olufisayo Omojokun each created a new massive open online course (MOOC) this year, making two out of the roughly 2,900 free online courses that were launched in 2021. A new study by classcentral.com shows that Hudacheck-Buswell’s course was the 61st most popular among new MOOCs Omojokun’s course was the 100th.
“Education is the foundation upon which we can improve our global society and quality of life,” said Hudachek-Buswell, who is a lecturer in the Division of Computing Instruction. “I have always dreamed of helping students who have limited access to quality education.”
Hudachek-Buswell created her course, “Data Structures & Algorithms 1,” with those students in mind.
“I focused on what students needed to see in order to understand the dynamics of different data structures and algorithms,” she said. “I embraced the opportunity to create new interactive components.”
Omojokun, who is a senior lecturer and the director of the Division of Computing Instruction, dug into the enrollment numbers for his course, and found that his students spanned multiple continents.
“It’s especially great to be able to reach a global audience beyond the walls of Georgia Tech,” Omojokun said. “It’s very much in line with Tech’s mission to ‘make a positive impact on the lives of people everywhere.’”
Both faculty members said that their work rests on the work of others. Former dean Zvi Galil began the college’s investment in online education through the Online Masters of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program. Dean Charles Isbell continues to support the expansion of online education. And many other colleagues, both in the College of Computing and Georgia Tech Professional Education, have contributed.

Undergraduate Teaching Assistants Honored with Institute and College Awards
Several School of Computing Instruction (SCI) teaching assistants were recognized for their hard work last month when they won Institute and College awards.
Graduating computer science majors Adavya Bhutani, Aleksandr Kalenchits, and Grant Hollosi all received Institute awards from the Georgia Tech Center for Teaching and Learning. This annual award celebrates contributions made by teaching assistants (TAs).
Schools and departments are asked to submit one person to be recognized in each of five categories. These school-level winners are then invited to participate in an Institute-wide competition.
The CS1332 undergraduate TAs were nominated by newly appointed SCI Associate Chair Mary Hudachek-Buswell. She says they show “hard work, dedication to fellow students, integrity, and so much more.”
Bhutani won the Online Teaching Assistant of the Year Award, Kalenchits won the Online Head Teaching Assistant of the Year Award, and Hollosi won the Undergraduate Teaching Assistant of the Year Award. Each was awarded with a prize of $500.
Other CS1332 TAs were honored at the 32nd Annual College of Computing Awards Luncheon including:
- Aishwarya Chakravarthy – Outstanding First Year Leadership
- Isha Palakurthy – Outstanding Legacy Leadership
- Nivedita Chellam – Outstanding 3rd Year Leadership
- Pratham Mehta – Outstanding 2nd Year Leadership
- Liam Jones – Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching Assistant
- Akshay Patil – Outstanding Undergraduate Head Teaching Assistant
“These young people are the best in Georgia Tech,” Hudachek-Buswell said.
TAs are a crucial part of course management for the college and are tasked with reviewing and explaining course content through recitations, office hours, program demos, and other responsibilities.
Many of the award winners and other CS1332 TAs are graduating this semester. Undergraduate TA positions will be open for the Fall semester and a new undergraduate TA scholarship award is on the horizon.
Hudachek-Buswell created a scholarship endowment for TAs last year to assist them financially. More information on the scholarship can be found here.
US News and World Report Rankings Highlight Strength and Scope of CS Program
The strength of Georgia Tech’s undergraduate computer science (CS) program is being recognized once again.
For the second year in a row, the U.S. News and World Report Best College rankings place Georgia Tech’s CS program at No. 5 nationally. The program is tied for No. 5 with Cornell University and the University of Illinois-Champagne Urbana.

Overall, Georgia Tech is tied at No. 10 in the Best Public University category and is ranked No. 38 in the nation among public and private universities. The Institute also ranks among the nation’s Most Innovative universities at No. 4.
Georgia Tech ranks No. 8 nationally in the most recent rankings of graduate computer science programs from U.S. News and World Report, which are from 2018.
UX Design MOOC Among Top 250 Most Popular Online Courses Ever Created
In 2014, Georgia Tech paved the way for high-quality online education when it created the Online Master of Computer Science in Computer Science (OMSCS), offering the first affordable, fully online master’s degree in the nation.
OMSCS has since produced nearly 6,500 graduates, and as of 2021, it had more than 11,500 students enrolled, making it the largest online master’s program in the U.S.
Along with supporting OMSCS, Georgia Tech also uses massive open online courses (MOOC) to offer people a taste of some of the Institute’s best programs without having to enroll. For instance, people can take a free introductory course that's part of the Master of Science in Human Computer Interaction (MS-HCI) curriculum, one of the Institute’s flagship programs.
Introduction to User Experience (UX) Design is taught by Rosa Arriaga, an associate professor and associate chair for graduate affairs at the School of Interactive Computing. The course is based on the Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction course (CS6750), a required course for MSCS-HCI students at Georgia Tech.
Since Arriaga launched the MOOC in 2017, more than 340,000 people have enrolled, with about 10 percent completing the course. Earlier this year, Class Central listed Introduction to User Experience Design as one of the top 250 most popular online courses ever created.
[RELATED: Top-Ranked Online Courses Reaching Students from Around the World]
The course is offered through online education platform Coursera. According to the company’s statistics, Introduction to User Experience Design has prompted 12 percent of students who complete the course to start a new career, while 24 percent received a tangible career benefit, and 16 percent received a pay increase or promotion at their job.
“Over the years, this course has continued to have a lot of appeal,” Arriaga said.
“Coursera offers courses for people who can’t go to Georgia Tech, for people who can’t go to Harvard, can’t go to the University of Washington — they can actually take these incredible classes for free.”
According to Coursera, Arriaga’s course gets about 2,000 new enrollees per week, and she said she gets frequent emails and messages on LinkedIn from people who have completed the course, thanking her, and telling her how much the course has helped them.
“I get these messages from all over the world,” Arriaga said. “Some people have invited me to give talks. People are always telling me they took the course from me and really liked it.”
The course is not offered for credit, but those who complete it can purchase a certificate of completion from Coursera.
Raising Brand Awareness
Georgia Tech has five courses on Class Central’s Top 250 list, which means each has a minimum enrollment of 160,000. Arriaga's UX intro course is the second-most popular course offered by Georgia Tech behind Speak English Professionally: In Person, Online, and Over the Phone, which has an enrollment of just over 832,000 and is taught by the Georgia Tech Language Institute.
While these courses don’t count toward a credit in degree program like the OMSCS, Arriaga said there are plenty of benefits for the users and the Institute. She said her course is targeted toward people who think they may have an interest in HCI. Students are under no obligation to complete the course, so Arriaga said having a 10 percent completion rate says something about the course’s value.
“If you start a class and you find out it’s not at all what you thought it would be, then it’s a good thing you didn’t finish it,” she said. “For the people who were interested, they do complete it.”
And they’ve learned more about the HCI program at Georgia Tech and what the Institute has to offer. It’s just one more way for Georgia Tech to put its brand out there, Arriaga said.
“It’s very gratifying to know you’ve put something out there that has so much visibility. It’s also visibility for Georgia Tech. At the end of the day, even if people don’t finish my class, they’ve already thought of Georgia Tech as this place that has these fantastic opportunities.”

"We Think Big" – Q&A with Dean Charles Isbell
As part of the College's Homecoming celebration, Dean of Computing Charles Isbell participated in a brief Q&A. In it, he shares some thoughts about his time as a Georgia Tech student, how the College has grown, and where he sees it heading in the coming years.
Q: What degree(s) did you earn and when did you graduate?
A: I grew up in Atlanta and Georgia Tech was the only school I applied to for undergrad. I earned a BS in Information and Computer Science in 1990, just before the College was officially formed and just before the degree became just computer science. I also picked up three minors: Spanish, History, and Engineering Psychology.
Q: What were the circumstances of your coming to work at the College of Computing?
A: I was working as a principal research scientist in AT&T labs when the opportunity—what those of us there at the time sometimes call the AT&T Labs Diaspora—came up to return to Georgia Tech. I was excited to join the faculty, and to see how far Computing had come since I had last attended. CoC was well on its way to changing the conversation about Computing, I thought I could be a part of that.
Q: Prior to this, had you ever thought about coming back to work at GT Computing?
Yes. Despite twelve years in exile in the frozen north, I’d actually always assumed it would happen one day.
Q: What’s one of your favorite memories from your time as a student?
I have too many to count. Almost all of them involve the friendships and connections I made while. I mean, I didn’t belong to a frat, I didn’t join any of the big clubs, but I always felt I belonged to a community.
Q: How has the College changed since you were a student?
Well, the College was founded the year I got out. I was actually the student representative on the committee that hired Peter Freeman, our first dean. So the College has changed in just about every conceivable way since I was a student. Perhaps the biggest change revolves around our ridiculous growth. One could attribute that to our investment in online education, and they would be right, but we’ve also seen a huge growth in our faculty, our on-campus students, and our reputation. When I left we had the possibility of being a top Computing unit. Today, we have achieved that.
Q: How is GT Computing different than similar institutions?
We’re big and we think big. We produce research and graduates at a scale that moves the market. But that’s a side effect of our willingness to take big risks, and to accept the mantle of leadership in a crisis, whether that’s by creating a College in the first place, upending undergraduate education and online education, or creating interdisciplinary research programs.
Q: What do you carry with you from your time as a student that still informs/influences your personal/professional life?
My belief and sense of community, of being home. That is the foundation of my philosophy as dean.
Q: How would you like to see the college grow in the next decade?
I am happy with our trajectory. What I most want to see is that we continue to take risks and be leaders. We are experiencing our next crisis now, and CoC should be leading the conversation around unchecked growth, the chaos of a being in a growing field, and accepting the mantle of responsibility that comes with being in this central discipline. Computing now touches almost every aspect of daily life, and we should be building programs and projects that reflect the reality of everyone who uses them.
'Welcome to Being a Cheesehead!' Community Reacts to Dean's Departure
Following the announcement this week that Dean Charles Isbell is leaving Georgia Tech, people from across campus and across the country have been sharing their thoughts and well-wishes.
Below are just a few examples of how people are responding to the news that Dean Isbell has accepted the position of provost at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UWM).
"Not going to lie. This one hurts. Outside of being an outstanding person and leader, Dean Isbell has been an absolutely incredible advocate for our admission and enrollment efforts-- as well as our goals of expanding access and amplifying Tech's impact locally and globally." – Rick Clark, assistant vice provost and executive director of Undergraduate Admission, via Twitter
"Congrats, Professor Isbell! Is there going to be a farewell music video from Smoov and Curly?" – Kevin Shih (CS MS 22) via LinkedIn
"@isbellHFh is coming to the right place. Grilled cheese in America's Dairyland is a thing of beauty. Charles Isbell, welcome to being a cheesehead!" – Tom Erickson, founding director of the School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences at UWM, via Twitter
"To me, Charles IS Georgia Tech. He taught my CS1100, which is a surprisingly big reason why I'm still here. Georgia Tech without Charles Isbell is like the Justice League without Superman, or the Avengers without Captain America. I'm sure he can tell me why that's a bad analogy." – David Joyner, executive director of Online Education & OMSCS, via Twitter
"Congratulations Dean Isbell!" – Susan Fong, GT Computing alumna, via Facebook
"Congratulations @UWMadison on your great new Provost. I will miss @gtalumni +@gtcomputing Dean @isbellHFh dearly but I'm delighted to see his impact grow and can't wait to see him continue to shape higher ed at one of our leading research universities." – Georgia Tech President Ángel Cabrera via Twitter
"Congrats, Professor Isbell!" – Mahrukh Zohaib Khan (CS MS 22) via LinkedIn
"I am delighted to welcome Charles Lee Isbell Jr., Dean of @GeorgiaTech as the next @UWMadison provost! He is an exceptional and imaginative scholar and administrator, and I'm very much looking forward to working with him." – UWM Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin, via Twitter
"So proud of my friend Charles Isbell @isbellHFh, who will be U. Wisconsin's next provost, starting this Fall. For those not steeped in academic terminology, that's basically the school's CEO (one step below president)." – Michael Littman, Brown University computer science professor, via Twitter
"Wow, big change for College of Computing at Georgia Tech & 'Smoov' Dr. Isbell. Both have been excellent and positively impactful to many. Best on the future and 'Give 'Em Hell'!" – John Clem (MS CS 16) via LinkedIn

"When You Mix Blackness with Anything, You Get a Cooler Version"
Cedric Stallworth (EE 90, MS CS 99) believes three things. First, that computing can offer incredible opportunities to African Americans. Second, that the Black community can offer incredible opportunities to computing. And third, that Georgia Tech is well-placed to make that connection happen.
“I don’t think computing has become common enough in our community to unleash our creativity,” Stallworth said. “I’m waiting for us to grasp the field and begin to create. When you mix Blackness with anything, you get a cooler version.”
Stallworth was named the inaugural Associate Dean for Inclusive Excellence for the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology in September. His job is to oversee the College’s efforts to recruit and support students from underrepresented groups.
He has a long-time connection to the Institute — he played football for Tech in the early 1990s, and then after a brief stint in the NFL and European leagues, came back to get his master’s degree. He’s been working on diversity and equity issues at Tech ever since.
“I’ve known the last five presidents of the Institute,” he said.
Tech is well placed to bring more African Americans into computing, Stallworth said, and it has a long commitment to doing so. In 1961, Tech became the first university in the South to integrate without a court order — and without violence. In 1979, it launched the Office of Minority Educational Development (OMED).
And the Institute continues to make strides not only in recruiting Black students but in bringing Black culture to campus.
“When I walk into the student center and see John Lewis’ name, it really does affect me,” Stallworth said. “And it has spaces for everyone. It’s obvious there was some diversity on the planning committee.”
There’s still more work to do, of course. Black communities still have much less access to computing than white communities. And it often takes longer for black students to find a community on campus.
“For example, white students rush fraternities and sororities their first week here,” Stallworth said. “You can’t pledge black fraternities and sororities until you’re a sophomore with a 2.5 GPA.”
“Students need a social network and an academic network,” he said. “When you get on the bus and say, ‘That test wrecked me,’ it helps a lot to hear someone else say, ‘me too.’”
Community isn’t the only issue, Stallworth said.
“If someone asked me how to take Georgia Tech to the next level in teaching and learning, I would recommend investing in mental health,” he said. “If we got mental health right, we would solve a lot of diversity issues.”
Stallworth is still in the early days of planning new diversity initiatives for the College. Right now, he’s working on some foundational concepts.
“We’re going to define diversity, we’re going to be very clear about terms, we’re going to put up the scoreboard, we’re going to track success,” he said. “I want to stay ahead of the pack.”
His ultimate goal is to expose black students to the creative side of technology.
“We all felt black culture changing music with technology,” he said. “Those systems the earliest DJ’s duct-taped together, the creative use of the Roland 808 drum machine, which many white musicians saw as a toy.”
“Right now computing is struggling with access, but once we nail that down we’ll move into creativity,” he said. “Just like food, just like music, tech is a wonderful ground for the mixing of cultures.”
Women Outnumbering Men for the First Time in Key HPC Research Group
This semester is the first time in Professor Srinivas Aluru’s career that the majority of Ph.D. students in his research group are women.
Not only is this high-water mark important for the pioneer in big data, it is also illustrates how the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) is leading progress and diversification in the field of high-performance computing (HPC).
“When we fail to adequately interest large segments of the population, such as women, the growth and direction of the HPC field is negatively impacted,” Aluru said. “It is exciting to walk into the workplace every morning having the opportunity to work with and learn from a diverse group with unique talents reflective of their background, experiences, and training.”
These women are more than a demographic or a label though. They are HPC trailblazers already making impacts in the field and beyond.
One example of this is Ph.D. candidate Shruti Shivakumar. She is a rising researcher with expertise in performant, parallel algorithms for hypergraph analytics. When not engaged in research on community detection and link prediction of diseases using tensor-based methods, she distinguishes herself through her leadership and service.
As part of the CSE Graduate Student Association, Shivakumar chairs HotCSE- a seminar series for students to share research, practice presentation skills, and bond with each other through their common experience as a graduate students.
In February, Shivakumar sat on the artifact evaluation committee at the International Conference on Compiler Construction in Montreal. She helped collect and organize digital objects, such as software systems, datasets, and scripts, that accepted authors used in their paper presentations at the conference.
“Taking on leadership roles and volunteering time for academic service has helped me build professional networks with other researchers in the community,” said Shivakumar. “I am thankful for these opportunities.”
School of CSE Ph.D. student Swethasree Bhattram is one of the newest members of Aluru’s research group.
After the California-native graduated with a B.S. in bioengineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, she came to Georgia Tech to pursue an M.S. in bioinformatics. Bhattram enjoyed researching computational biology so much that she altered plans by continuing her education toward attaining a Ph.D.
Though initially focused on clinical informatics, Bhattram became interested in HPC and software development. Here, she researches algorithm parallelization for single-cell multi-modal integration. One area Bhattram devotes her studies toward is in algorithm development for improving diagnosis of sepsis.
“As someone who has a broad degree in bioengineering, I wanted to be in a place where I would have the resources to explore all possible avenues,” Bhattram said. “I decided to continue my Ph.D. because I found a good fit with my personality and Dr. Srinivas Aluru's lab, and I felt like I was getting into a good flow of work while studying here.”
Another newcomer to Georgia Tech is Kalsuda Lapborisuth, a Ph.D. student with passion for developing mathematical approaches to advance data-driven clinical treatments.
While Lapborisuth is new to Tech, she is no stranger to studying computational techniques in medicine. As an undergraduate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, Lapborisuth presented a computational method to model biological aging trends based on epigenetic data.
Lapborisuth continues to pursue her passion through Aluru’s group where she works closely with Bhattaram in parallelizing multi-modal single-cell sequencing data analysis. In addition to research, she is also involved in the CSE Graduate Student Association leadership as its treasurer.
“Our group's research is at the intersection of HPC and bioinformatics,” said Lapborisuth. “We work to design and parallelize algorithms that can effectively leverage computational resources to speed up the analysis of biological data that are growing exponentially in both volume and diversity.”
Neda Tavakoli is another Ph.D. candidate in Aluru’s group nearing completion of her degree. Her research
involves developing algorithms and software tools that leverage HPC to analyze large-scale genomic and biological datasets.
Tavakoli’s research exemplifies how HPC can make an impact in more than just the group’s wheelhouse of bioinformatics and computational biology. Her most cited paper presents forecasting time series models tested on financial data, lending itself for use in business and economics.
Along with being one of the senior members of Aluru’s group, Tavakoli serves as the vice president/internal coordinator of Women in High Performance Computing (WHPC) at Georgia Tech. Her duties include collaborating with various organizations to provide networking opportunities and creating more career success opportunities for members.
When asked about her success as an aspiring researcher, Tavakoli said it goes back to her advisor and the value in relationships.
“I am incredibly grateful for Srinivas' guidance and support throughout my Ph.D. journey,” Tavakoli said. “His mentorship has made a lasting impact on my life and academic pursuits.”
Work Limiting Internet Fraud Lands Assistant Professor on Prestigious Forbes List
Srijan Kumar, assistant professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering, was named one of Forbes’ annual 30 under 30 in Science for 2022. Kumar is being recognized for making the internet a safer place by working to stop malicious actors from spreading fraud and disinformation.
“It’s kind of unreal,” Kumar said. “I used to see the Forbes lists when I was an undergrad and I was inspired by them.”Kumar’s previous work has been used by Flipkart, which is India’s largest e-commerce platform. He has also studied — and influenced — Twitter’s Birdwatch platform, which provides a community-based approach to counter misinformation.
“It’s a major challenge, because malicious actors are always looking for ways to fool the AI and ML models that are designed to catch them,” Kumar said. “Any system a company develops typically works well for a few months and then new models are needed to catch the evolved bad actors.”
[RELATED: Research Finds Models Used to Detect Malicious Users on Popular Social Sites are Vulnerable to Attack]
The Covid pandemic actually changed Kumar’s research, in a couple of key ways. First, he began to study health misinformation, the role of regular people in countering it, and the effects misinformation has on the mental health of those who consume it. He also worked on anti-Asian racism related to the pandemic.
The other shift was technical, focusing on tech factors that help bad actors thrive. Lately, Kumar and his research group are digging into recommender systems, those machine learning algorithms that bring you new products on Amazon or new videos on YouTube.
“We don’t know much about their reliability, trust and safety,” Kumar said. “We are trying to understand how robust these recommender systems are.”
[RELATED: Computing Alums Make Forbes 30 Under 30 List]
Finally, Kumar emphasized the amount of work done by other people that went into his recognition.
“It wouldn’t have been possible without my students, my colleagues, my mentors here and elsewhere,” he said. “I’m grateful for Georgia Tech.”
This is the second year in a row that a College of Computing faculty member has made the Forbes' 30 Under 30 list. Diyi Yang, School of Interactive Computing assistant professor, was named to the class of 2021 list.
Wrist-Mounted Warning System Helps Wearers Identify Cyber Threats
Think back to a time you stood next to someone when you were abruptly shocked or scared by a sudden occurrence in your environment. How did you communicate that emotion to your companion? If you’re like most, perhaps your first instinct was to grab and squeeze their wrist, signaling the urgency of the warning and the need for them to take some preventative action.
That’s a psychological predisposition that has been examined in the past and the basis for a new approach to cybersecurity developed by researchers at Georgia Tech. Aiming to bring the intangible threats of the cyber world into the real world using a more visceral mode of communication, researchers have developed Spidey Sense, a wrist-mounted haptic device intended for use with smartwatches.
Spidey Sense, which uses various programmable patterns of squeezing sensations to alert users to urgent cybersecurity warnings, has shown to be more effective at communicating often obscure or hard-to-understand threats and could lead to more secure behavior by wearers.
“Unlike threats in the physical world, cyber threats are communicated rationally but not viscerally,” said Youngwook Do, a Ph.D. student in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing. “People might be able to see that they are navigating a website with an expired SSL certificate the way they might see a red light on a pedestrian crossing, but they may not feel that they shouldn’t proceed to that website the way they would if a friend grabbed their wrist before they attempted to jaywalk.”
Currently, the most common mode of communication of cyber threats is a popup on the computer with a description of the threat that, more often than not, is difficult for the reader to distinguish the warning from other visual information. As a lot of information is communicated through a screen, these warnings tend to fade into the background with the multitude of other similar notifications.
What is needed, Do said, is a mechanism of delivering cybersecurity warnings that bridge the gap between the presence of a cyber threat and the physical perception of that threat while differentiating the communication channel.
VIDEO: Spidey Sense: Designing Wrist-Mounted Affective Haptics for Communicating Cybersecurity Warnings
Spidey Sense achieves this by taking advantage of an existing wearable – the smartwatch wristband. Building on the foundational knowledge about human instinct to communicate fear or surprise through grabbing the wrist, the team thought this would be an appropriate parallel to use in the cyber world. By connecting the smartwatch to other devices, like a phone or tablet or computer, the haptic feature on the wristband would then be able to communicate to the wearer potential urgent threats they were encountering as they explored the internet.
“On a web browser, we receive so much different information that is delivered to us visually that we often disregard an important security warning,” Do said. “On smartphones, we receive notifications for any messages, news alerts, sports scores. Since all are communicated through a popup on a screen, a chiming sound, or vibrotactile feedback, we may ignore something in there that could be particularly important. We found that squeeze haptics can help improve a user’s ability to distinguish between the two.”
Currently, Spidey Sense is solely a tool for communication, but Do suggested that future work could build on this by exploring modes of detecting security threats, as well.
“Our ultimate goal is to be able to detect and communicate effectively the cyber threats people encounter occasionally,” Do said. “The challenge is having enough data, which we don’t have yet.”
This work is part of a broader effort to create more usable cybersecurity capabilities. It was presented in a paper titled Spidey Sense: Designing Wrist-Mounted Affective Haptics for Communicating Cybersecurity Warnings. In addition to Do, the team includes Linh Thai Hoang, Jung Wook Park, Gregory Abowd, and Sauvik Das.
A Year of Cybersecurity and Privacy at Georgia Tech
Almost a year after their first virtual meeting, the faculty and staff of the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP) met recently on the fifth floor of the Coda building in Tech Square to celebrate one year of education and research.
In the fall of 2020, the Georgia Institute of Technology announced the establishment of its newest academic unit in 10 years. This new unit aligned the three master degree programs in the College of Computing, College of Engineering, and the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts to create an interdisciplinary school capable of tackling the evolving threats to cybersecurity and privacy.
“I’m pleased and proud to see the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy developing into the world-class, cross-college school that so many have worked to make it,” said Charles Isbell, Dean of Computing and John P. Imlay, Jr. Chair. “The future is even brighter, and I look forward to the new developments in leadership, research, and curriculum that are on the way.”
The rise of regularly occurring cyberattacks contributed to the need to form the new school.
“We were formed to solve a global problem,” said Rich DeMillo, SCP interim chair. “As more businesses are digitally transformed the ability of adversaries to hack into systems to cause damage, to cause chaos, and to steal things has become a global problem.”
The cybersecurity and privacy research done by faculty across Georgia Tech has continued under SCP. Prior to the school’s establishment, the Institute for Information Security and Privacy (IISP) housed the Institute’s research faculty in this burgeoning domain.
“In IISP there was a huge uptick in collaborative research within Georgia Tech in the cybersecurity space, particularly across multiple academic units,” said Wenke Lee, IISP executive director. “This momentum is continuing with SCP because we have faculty from multiple academic units within Georgia Tech as well as the Georgia Tech Research Institute.”
The School of Cybersecurity and Privacy currently employs 40 faculty members that continue to make advancements in research while training and educating the school’s graduate students. SCP has more than 60 students in its Ph.D. program, 500 students enrolled in a master’s program, and 650 students in the online master’s program.
Computing Equity Project: Impacting Public Schools
Since the passing of Senate Bill 108 (SB 108), schools across Georgia have been gearing up to offer computer science classes for high school students.
SB 108 says that school districts across the state must offer computer science education courses to all Georgia high school students by the 2024-25 school year. It also recommends that all middle schools offer CS courses as well.
With teacher shortages and the reality that some teachers don’t have a computer science background, this transition has taken a great deal of collaboration.
One of the Georgia Tech Constellations Center for Equity in Computing’s answers to these needs is the Computing Equity Project (CEP).
The CEP creates a cohort of CS equity coaches to help foster the inclusive and equitable environment that Constellations has been working toward since its founding.
“The computing equity project is a way to continue to advocate for equity and inclusion in CS. The focus of the coaches is to provide teachers with best practices for creating identity-inclusive computing, as well as culturally relevant/culturally responsive pedagogies, and content,” Sababu Barashango, Constellations fellow.
Constellations currently has three fellows, two that go into Atlanta Public Schools and coach teachers so that they are prepared for the changes coming in the next year, the third fellow, works to support computing equity at the state level.
The coaches are educators with a wide array of background experience from across the state and the country.
There are six coaches:
- Mike Afdahl is the Coordinator of Technology Services for Northwest GA RESA.
- Laura Crunk has been a teacher for more than 15 years.
- Wendy Dyer, a native of Social Circle, Georgia, has been an educator since 1998.
- Kimberly Nichols earned her Bachelors of Business Administration in finance from East Tennessee State University, an MBA from Kennesaw State University, and M.Ed. and Ed.S.
- LaWanda Stephens-Sanford is a United States Marine Corps veteran who became a teacher in a non-traditional way.
- Philisia Spearmon is a computer science and mathematics teacher at Tattnall County High School and an adjunct professor for Southeastern Technical College.
Each coach brings a very individualized approach to education with diversity being the road to inclusion and feelings of belonging.

Biography
Dr. Rozga is a research scientist in the School of Interactive Computing. She is a developmental psychologist with an interest in autism and related developmental conditions. Her current research lies at the interdisciplinary boundary between developmental psychology and computing. She asks questions regarding how the behavior of individuals with autism emerges and transforms over time. To find answers, she applies novel sensing capabilities, and computationally driven measurement and modeling. This work is leading to novel ways of capturing and quantifying complex human behaviors, as well as developing new understandings of these behaviors, both among typically developing individuals and those with autism. The ultimate goal is to make these new measurements and modeling techniques work outside the lab, in real-world environments like the home, schools, and clinics where there is a need for more objective, reliable means of tracking the emergence of autism and its developmental course.
Dr. Rozga also has a broad interest in exploring how technology can impact research and clinical care of autism. Recent projects in this space include evaluating a novel telehealth tool to support remote diagnosis of autism using videos recorded by parents in the home, and developing and evaluating motion-based games to support engagement and collaboration among students with autism.
Dr. Rozga received a B.A. in Psychology (2000) from the University of California Berkeley, and an M.S. (2002) and Ph.D. (2007) in Developmental Psychology from the University of California Los Angeles. She completed a two-year postdoctoral fellowship through the Center for Behavior Neuroscience at Georgia State University before joining the faculty at Georgia Tech in 2010. She is currently a Senior Research Scientist in the School of Interactive Computing, and is the Director of the Georgia Tech Child Study Lab.

Biography
I've started as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech in August 2019, transitioning from my postdoc at the University of California Berkeley, where I worked with Ion Stoica and collaborated closely with Joseph Gonzalez. I completed my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Gregory Ganger. At Carnegie Mellon, I was honored by the prestigious NSERC Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship (NSERC CGS-D3) and partially funded by the Intel Science and Technology Centre for Cloud Computing and Parallel Data Lab. Prior to Carnegie Mellon, I worked on agile stateful VM replication with para-virtualization at the University of Toronto, where I worked with Eyal de Lara and Michael Brudno. My interest in cloud computing, datacenter operating systems, and programming the cloud brought me to the University of Toronto from industry, where I had been developing cluster middleware for distributed datacenter resource management.

Research Areas: machine learning, computational neuroscience
Biography
My research interest is to develop scientifically-motivated probabilistic modeling approaches for neural and behavior analyses, and scalable and efficient inference algorithms to fit the models. Specifically, my lab focuses on:
(i) Probabilistic modeling for neural latent discovery: We are interested in developing disentangled generative latent variable models to mine interpretable latent representations from neural populations. The modeling topics would involve various deep generative models, such as variational auto encoder, (deep) Gaussian process, Bayesian neural net, etc.
(ii) Behavior analysis and understanding: We aim at extracting multi-layer information from animal behaviors and allows neuro-behavior analysis for both motor functions and cognitive functions. The research direction will involve projects such as 3D full-body kinematic model estimation, developing hierarchical spatial and temporal models for animal behavior syllables, studying intrinsic motives and reward representations of animals via (inverse) reinforcement learning, etc.
(iii) Probabilistic modeling and efficient inference approaches for: Bayesian (convolutional) neural net, deep Gaussian process, Bayesian active learning and deep generative models, etc.

Research Areas: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning
Biography
Charles Isbell's research passion is artificial intelligence. In particular, he focuses on applying statistical machine learning to building autonomous agents that must live and interact with large numbers of other intelligent agents, some of whom may be human.
Lately, Isbell has turned his energies toward adaptive modeling, especially activity discovery (as distinct from activity recognition); scalable coordination; and development environments that support the rapid prototyping of adaptive agents. As a result, he has begun developing adaptive programming languages, worrying about issues of software engineering, and trying to understand what it means to bring machine learning tools to non-expert authors, designers, and developers.

School of Interactive Computing
Assistant Professor
Research Areas: Artificial Intelligence; Cognitive Systems; Cognitive and Learning Sciences; Human-Computer Interaction; Learning Technology.
Biography
Chris MacLellan is an Assistant Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology, where he leads the Teachable AI Lab (TAIL; https://tail.cc.gatech.edu). His work on cognitive systems aims to advance our understanding of how people teach and learn and to build AI systems that can teach and learn like people do and in ways that are compatible with people. He explores the development of computational models of learning and how these models can support the development of AI technologies, such as intelligent tutoring systems and medical decision support systems, at scale.
He also investigates how data collected about how people learn and make decisions can be leveraged to drive the development of better cognitive models and computational learning systems. Chris has been a principal investigator on multiple sponsored project awards with DARPA, the U.S. Army, ONR, and NSF. He has also received external recognition for his work, such as the 2022 EAAI Now and Future AI Educator award as well as being named on the 2021 Technical.ly RealLIST of technologists building Philadelphia’s future.
Prior to his position at Georgia Tech, Chris was an Assistant Professor of Information Science and Computer Science (by co-appointment) at Drexel University. Before that, he completed his PhD in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computing, where he was a fellow in the Program for Interdisciplinary Education Research (PIER).
The products of his work have immediate implications for AI-powered technology development. For example, through his work with the NSF-funded AI ALOE Institute, Chris is developing tools that let teachers build AI-powered tutors by naturally teaching an AI agent rather than programming. His work also has many broader implications, such as enabling doctors to support the development of AI-powered diagnoses tools where few training examples are available (DARPA-funded POCUS project) and for creating personal assistant agents that can engage in collaborative learning to support more effective human-machine teaming (ARL-funded STRONG project).
Associate Professor
Research Areas: Human-Centered Computing; Participatory Design; Digital Civics
Biography
My research is focused on digital civics, an area of innovation that emerges at the intersection of participatory design, digital democracy, and smart cities. Together with students and community partners, we co-create new artifacts and computational systems to assert identity, to contend with local issues, and to respect community experiences, beliefs, and desires.
The work I do touches a number of different domains, including: Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Social Computing, Urban Informatics, Science and Technology Studies, Participatory Design, and Design Research. I am the author of Designing Publics (2016, MIT Press).

Professor Emeritus
http://oue.gatech.edu/content/colin-potts
Research Areas: Professional ethics, Social implications of information technology, Requirements engineering, Design thinking
Biography
Dr. Colin Potts, the vice provost for undergraduate education oversees offices and programs affecting undergraduate education including the Center for Career Discovery and Development (C2D2), the Honors Program (HP), the Center for Academic Enrichment (CAE), Center for Academic Success (CAS), and the Center for Serve-Learn-Sustain (SLS).
Dr. Potts sits on the President’s Cabinet and represents Georgia Tech’s undergraduate academic affairs to the University System of Georgia Board of Regents and the Association of American Universities (AAU), among other constituencies. He also evaluates and approves academic policies affecting undergraduate students and proposals for all undergraduate courses and programs.
After earning a Ph.D. from Sheffield University in psychology for performing research in text memory and comprehension, and then working as a software engineer and ergonomics consultant, Potts joined the Department of Computing at Imperial College. Later, he moved to the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation as a senior technical staff member. Potts joined the Georgia Tech College of Computing in 1992 as a faculty member in what is now the School of Interactive Computing. His research over the past 25 years has spanned the fields of requirements engineering, software design methods, human-computer interaction and information privacy. All his research has been interdisciplinary and has emphasized the human element in technology design and use. Potts is best known for design methods that start not from technology innovation but from user needs and envisaged scenarios of use.
Potts has been responsible for designing and teaching courses in software engineering, human-computer interaction design and evaluation and the social and ethical implications of information technology. He has taught at the undergraduate, master’s and doctoral levels; professional development seminars; and evening courses. His passion, however, is undergraduate education- for which he received the 2010 William “Gus” Baird Faculty Teaching Award and the 2012 Eichholz Faculty Teaching Award. He frequently teaches introductory courses in computer science to non-majors.
He has taught in study abroad programs in Barcelona and Oxford, led a ThinkBig living learning community and participated in the development of the X-Degree and TechArts- initiatives that emerged from the institute’s 25-year strategic plan and seek to broaden the academic experiences of students.
Potts is a photographer with several one-man exhibits to his name and is a keen but rusty chess player (lifetime high of USCF 2050 but now languishing in the low 1800s). He was born in London, which explains his oddly spelled sense of humor and his lifelong support for Tottenham Hotspur FC. He is married to a professor and poet, has two cats and an adult son.

Biography
David’s Ph.D. research is at the intersection of machine learning, uncertainty modeling, and numerical methods. In particular, he develops machine learning algorithms that can be used in domains under significant uncertainty—with randomness, imprecise data, hidden information, and partial observability. Ultimately, the main goal of David’s research is to develop methods and algorithms for autonomous decision-making and control, where artificial agents have to act in real-world situations. Applications of his research include physical infrastructure systems, markets & finance, cloud computing, and cyber-security. David is defending his Ph.D. dissertation “Interval Deep Learning for Uncertainty Quantification in Engineering Problems” in Fall 2020.

Advisor: Felix J. Herrmann
Professor
Research Areas: Robotics, Computer Vision
Biography
Dr. Dellaert does research in the areas of robotics and computer vision, which present some of the most exciting challenges to anyone interested in artificial intelligence. He is especially keen on Bayesian inference approaches to the difficult inverse problems that keep popping up in these areas. In many cases, exact solutions to these problems are intractable, and as such he is interested in examining whether Monte Carlo (sampling-based) approximations are applicable in those cases.
Since coming to Georgia Tech Dr. Dellaert has explored the theme of probabilistic, model-based reasoning paired with randomized approximation methods in three main research areas:
- Advanced sequential Monte Carlo methods
- Spatio-Temporal Reconstruction from Images
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
Assistant Professor, Joint with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
Research Areas: Network Security; Internet Measurements; Usable Security and Human Factors in Security; Software Security

Affiliations
School of Computer Science
Professor and Fleming Chair Emeritus
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Jim.Foley/foley.html
Research Areas: Information Visualization; HCI
Biography
Jim Foley is a computing pioneer, innovative educator, and respected author.
A leading international figure in two major disciplines of computer science (graphics and human-computer interaction), Foley has received lifetime achievement awards in both fields from the Association for Computer Machinery’s special interest groups (SIGGRAPH in 1997 and SIGCHI in 2007). Foley was one of the computer graphics pioneers who went on to help establish HCI as a discipline.
Co-author of three books, he is the first author of what many consider the definitive text in computer graphics, Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics, which has sold 400,000 copies in 10 translations.
Foley arrived at the College of Computing in 1991 and founded the GVU Center. Five years later, U.S. News and World Report ranked the center No. 1 for graduate computer science work in graphics and user interaction.
Active in industry, Foley became director of MERL (Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory) in 1996 and then CEO and chairman of Mitsubishi Electric Information Technology Center America in 1998. He returned to Georgia in late 1999 to head up the state's Yamacraw economic development initiative in design of broadband systems, devices and chips.
For four years (2001-2005), Foley chaired the Computing Research Association (CRA), which represents more than 200 research universities, corporate research labs and professional societies.
In February 2008, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, among the highest professional distinctions given to an engineer. A few months later, he received the 2008 Class of 1934 Distinguished Professor Award, the highest honor Georgia Tech bestows on faculty. He is also a Fellow of ACM, IEEE and AAAS.
Of all his awards, Foley says he most treasures the one given him by computing graduate students who named him "Most Likely to Make Students Want to Grow Up to be Professors."
Foley served as interim dean of the College of Computing from 2008 to 2010.

Biography
Janet Kolodner's research has addressed issues in learning, memory, and problem solving, both in computers and in people. She pioneered the computer reasoning method called case-based reasoning, a way of solving problems based on analogies to past experiences, and her lab emphasized case-based reasoning for situations of real-world complexity. Her book, Case-Based Reasoning, synthesizes work across the field of case-based reasoning from its inception to 1993. The notion of a case-based design aid (CBDA), or an indexed library of design cases with the kinds of information in them that can help designers make design decisions, comes from her lab, which was the originator of the first CBDA, Archie-II, in collaboration with colleagues in architecture. She has also been a leader in articulating the cognitive model case-based reasoning implies and the applications and implications of case-based reasoning for education and creative problem solving. For the past decade, she has focused most of her research using the model to design science curriculum for middle school. The approach, called Learning by Design™ (LBD), is a design-based learning approach and an inquiry-oriented project-based approach to science learning. Students learn science and scientific reasoning in the context of designing working artifacts (e.g., a miniature vehicle). The challenge engages them and encourages curiosity, the want to succeed promotes a want to learn what's needed to succeed, and the design cycle, which interweaves design and investigation, engineering and scientific reasoning, learning and application, and doing and reflection, helps children identify what they need to learn, come to understand the science content and come to become well-versed in science practices. More recently, she and her students are applying what they've learned about design-based learning to informal education -- after-school programs, museum programs, and museum exhibits. The goal of these projects is to identify ways of helping pre-teens and young teens consider who they are as thinkers and to come to value informed decision making and informed production and consumption of evidence. In Kitchen Science Investigators, 5th and 6th graders are learning in the context of cooking. In Hovering Around, they are learning in the context of designing hovercraft.
Kolodner was founding Director of Georgia Tech's EduTech Institute, whose mission is to use what we know about cognition to inform the design of educational technology and learning environments. She served as coordinator of G eorgia Tech's cognitive science program for many years. Professor Kolodner is founding Editor in Chief of The Journal of the Learning Sciences, an interdisciplinary journal that focuses on learning and education. She is a founder of the International Society for the Learning Sciences, and she served as its first Executive
Officer.

Biography
Advisor: Le Song
I primarily work in the intersection of deep learning and logical reasoning for complex machine learning problems. These complex problems are typically multi-modal problems between computer vision and natural language, such as visual question answering. More specifically I investigate the label annotation and computational complexity for methods addressing these problems. I am also broadly interested in large scale structured prediction problems from biological, recommender, and financial systems.
