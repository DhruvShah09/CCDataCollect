Computing Alum Spotlights Theater Community’s Economic Struggle
Although many businesses have reopened following the spring shutdown, performing arts venues mostly have not. Because of this, people working in the arts have been among the hardest-hit workers during the pandemic.
Workers in Atlanta’s theater community have certainly had to face this challenge as well. Shuttered box offices, canceled productions, and darkened stages have meant little to no work for thousands of people who make their living through the performing arts in venues across the metro area.
“Very little is being done in Atlanta. Everyone from stagehands to actors to parking attendants and all of the others that help make a performance happen are having a really tough time right now,” said Atlanta photographer and GT Computing alumnus Michael Boatright (BS ICS 82 COOP).
“Some stages have grant-type support, which is helping to make rent, but the entertainment industry as a whole is struggling.”
To help rally support for Atlanta’s theater community, Boatright has launched a new photographic exploration called Dark Houses Atlanta, which is now available online.
The visual story documents darkened theaters across metro Atlanta including the Fabulous Fox Theatre, Actor’s Express, and Georgia Tech’s Ferst Center for the Performing Arts. Boatright photographed each stage location as it was, with the set that was in place when the performers and crew left.
“There’s nothing like seeing 4,000 empty seats to help you realize how much you miss being there with a full house,” said Boatright.
He added that it’s important to spotlight the issue for people that are not directly impacted.
“While the theater has survived plagues, social upheaval, and economic hardships, it will need lots of support from the community to survive all three at the same time.”
Boatright began the Dark Houses Atlanta project by first shooting the main stage at the Ferst Center because of his Georgia Tech connection. Along with being an alumnus, he has also been photographing preview performances for DramaTech – Georgia Tech’s student-run theater – for the past six years.
DramaTech is the longest continuously running theater company in the southeastern United States. In March, Boatright emailed asking about the troupe’s upcoming show.
“Of course, they were all very bummed, especially the graduating seniors, it would have been their last show,” said Boatright.
However, rather than canceling altogether, the students decided to put on the show with half-built sets and incomplete technical elements.
“I shot the performance but it was tough; I was crying the whole time because the students played their hearts out. I have never been more proud of a group of people, and I know our future is in good hands with graduating students like that,” said Boatright.

Modeling & Simulation
Represent Natural and Physical Processes
The Modeling & Simulation thread is intended for students interested in developing a deep understanding and appreciation of how natural and human-generated systems such as weather, biological processes, supply chains, or computers, can be represented by mathematical models and computer software. Such models are widely used today to better understand and predict the behavior of such systems.
Because these models are often described and represented by mathematical expressions, and the models themselves often deal with physical phenomena, a background in mathematics and the sciences is required. Combining this background with a knowledge in computer science will yield the basic tools necessary to transform abstract conceptual models to computer programs that execute efficiently on digital machines. The required coursework in Modeling & Simulation includes topics in continuous and discrete mathematics, the sciences, and computing. Elective courses enable students to further develop and apply their knowledge and skills to a specific discipline where Modeling & Simulation plays an important role.
The student who pursues Modeling & Simulation can combine it with Intelligence to become a data miner, or with Media to build visualizations of large amounts of scientific data, or People to build work flow systems for scientists who aren't computing experts to use. The possibilities are endless.

Theory
Discover the theoretical foundations underlying a wide range of computing disciplines.
The Theory thread is where computing models and addresses scaling. Theory quantifies, in mathematical terms, the efficiency by which problems are solved, as problem instances grow in size.
In the Theory thread, students study abstractions of universal computational models, complexity classes within which many natural problems fall, and abstract methods to design efficient algorithms and analyze algorithmic performance. Early preparation includes introduction to programming, discrete math, proof techniques, algorithms and complexity. The student who pursues the Theory thread will eventually learn to formally quantify and improve performance either within theoretical computer science, or within an applied area of computer science, or in another science with a clear computational component (such as computational biology, physics, economics, mathematics, optimization etc).
A student can combine Theory with Information Internetworks to enhance and quantify the performance of networks or databases or pursue security and cryptography, or with Systems & Architecture to design programming languages or build provably efficient systems and software, or with Modeling & Simulation to solve, with proven rigor, a wide range of real-world large scale problems. A student who pursues Theory can combine it with any other thread and enhance those skills with a deep quantitative understanding of performance of the objects studied in the other thread. In addition, in any application related work environment, from a research or development lab, to a consulting firm or the stock market, ability to design tools, reason about them formally, and quantify performance is a skill that greatly enhances one's vita.
A student who pursues the theory thread at Georgia Tech is also an excellent candidate for a Ph.D. in theoretical computer science.

TSO is responsible for setting the automatic door schedules for CCB and KACB (e.g. some door areas are automatically locked during evening and weekend hours). BuzzCard accessible doors will either have a magnetic stripe reader or a proximity reader attached to them.
Based on your role within the CoC, you will be granted automatic default access (see Default Door Access table below) to certain door areas. A door area is a collection of one or more doors in a building. If you need door access to additional areas beyond your automatic allotment, you must seek sponsorship from a CoC faculty or staff member who, in turn, will request access from the steward of the door area. The door area steward will evaluate your request and authorize access if it is warranted.

College of Computing Previews Institute Address
Thursday, President G.P. “Bud” Peterson will present the 2016 Institute Address, during which he will highlight recent Georgia Tech achievements, share his vision and goals for the new school year, and engage in an open Q and A session.
As part of the preparation for the address, the College of Computing had the opportunity to share some of its recent achievements with the president. With limited time, however, and so many notable things happening across campus, there is no way to know what will make it into the presentation.
Therefore, we thought you might like to see the College of Computing slides presented to President Peterson.
Of course, the slides below are just a glimpse of the dynamic people, innovative research, and worthwhile results at #GTComputing. You can keep up with all of this and more by following the College of Computing on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
The full script and slide presentation for the 2016 Institute Address is available on the president's website.
College of Computing Reveals Social Media Contest Winners
No matter where Georgia Tech computing takes you, the adventure never ends! This was the theme of the recently concluded #GTComputingAdventures social media contest sponsored by the College of Computing.
The contest launched June 15 and wrapped up Aug. 10. In that time, more than 150 photos from as far away as Patagonia and Kathmandu were shared to the College’s Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts using the hashtag, #GTComputingAdventures. Each person entering the photo contest will receive a t-shirt designed for the competition.
Two grand prize winners were also selected: one for the photo taken the farthest away from Georgia Tech, and one for the photo with the most likes. These winners will each receive a set of Beats by Dre headphones.
And the winners are…
OMS CS student Genevieve Hayes, aka @murderandagnst, shared the photo taken farthest away from campus. Posted on Twitter, her winning picture of the State Library of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia was taken 9,682 miles away from Georgia Tech.
Taken not quite so far away, the photo entry that earned the most likes depicts a view from Little Si, a mountain in Washington. Shared by Sana Ajani, a third-year Georgia Tech computer science major, this image earned 133 likes on Instagram. @comic_sana, as Ajani is known on Instagram, was in Washington this summer working as an Explorer Intern at Microsoft.
With the success of this summer’s contest, the College of Computing is planning another #GTComputingAdventures contest for next year. Until then, the College encourages students, alumni, faculty, and staff to share their photos and adventures using the hashtag, #GTComputing.

Computing Ranks Well for Gender Diversity Says Industry Report
A recent industry report finds that Georgia Tech is doing comparatively well when it comes to the gender diversity of its computer science (CS) faculty.
The report from CrowdStrike, a global cybersecurity company, says that Georgia Tech ranks second in the U.S. for gender diversity among CS faculty. According to the report, women comprise 23.8 percent of the CS faculty at Georgia Tech.
“Pushing forward on gender equity is a top strategic driver for the College and the Institute so I’m pleased that we have ranked well in this report. There is still much to be done, but this is solid evidence that our efforts to even the playing field are paying off, and that we are moving in the right direction,” said Charles Isbell, Georgia Tech dean of computing and John P. Imlay Jr. chair.
In the report, Duke University ranks first with women making up 27.4 percent of its CS faculty. Harvard University ranks third with 23.7 percent female CS faculty. The U.S. average is 18.7 percent.
The analysis examined faculty listings on websites for the top 25 CS schools as ranked in U.S. News and World Report’s 2018 graduate program rankings. It included data for professors, instructors, and researchers, but does not include staff members.
The reasons for bringing attention to gender diversity in computer science are clear. The CrowdStrike report references data from a recent Microsoft survey that showed that women are 52 percent more likely to stay in STEM fields if they have a female role model.
According to the report, “The fewer female computer science academics there are, the less likely female students are to continue to study computer sciences, graduate with a computer sciences degree and go on to inspire other females to do so.”
“I’m exceedingly proud of our female faculty members. The mentorship, leadership, and guidance they provide, and the example they set, are vitally important to the ongoing success of our female students at every level,” said Isbell.
Along with this encouraging news about faculty gender diversity, the College is also seeing positive growth in female student enrollments.
Nationally, 18 percent of undergraduate CS majors are women. According to enrollment data, 27 percent of CS majors at Georgia Tech are women. The percentage of female CS Ph.D. students nationally is 21 percent, while at Tech 24 percent of CS Ph.D. students are female.
Overall, total female enrollment in B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. programs, has grown from 16 percent of GT Computing students a decade ago to 21 percent today. This equates to 31 percent growth in female enrollment in the College over the past decade.
CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Georgia Tech College of Computing alumnus.

Cassie Mitchell: An Assistant Professor Pioneering Research in Predictive Medicine While Chasing Paralympic Gold
On her desk sits a sign that says “Never, never, never give up.” There could not be a more fitting sign for Cassie Mitchell to have on display. A former track star with dreams of becoming an orthopedic surgeon, Mitchell is now an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Machine Learning Center at Georgia Tech. She is also a Paralympic medalist. It’s not exactly the path she would have chosen herself, but she’s proud of it.
From Cowgirl to City Slicker
To many of Mitchell’s friends and family back home in Oklahoma, she is an “animal whisperer.” She always seems to know what to do with animals, including calming down a 2,000-pound bull, which is a gift even more amazing to behold now that Mitchell is wheelchair-bound quadriplegic.
“I think it would surprise people to know that the girl spinning around in a wheelchair, looking at multi-factorial diseases in a lab in a big city, is the same girl who grew up competing in goat-tying, barrel racing, and pole bending,” said Mitchell laughing.
As a teenager, Mitchell rehabbed a retired racehorse and together the duo won five world titles in equine events, the first of many sports world titles that Mitchell would claim.
The Moment That Changed Everything
At age 12, Mitchell started to experience double vision and blurred vision. After waking up paralyzed at the age of 18, the track scholarship student was diagnosed with neuromyletitis optica – more commonly known as Devic’s disease. Overnight, Mitchell saw her dreams come crashing down as the disease left her paralyzed from the neck down and with permanent double vision.
“I lost my track scholarship, and my dreams of becoming an orthopedic surgeon just vanished. That was really hard,” said Mitchell.
Though her athletic scholarship was gone, Mitchell had graduated valedictorian of her high school and was offered an academic scholarship to Oklahoma State University.
It was during an advising session that she chose engineering.
“Being from a small, rural town. I had no idea what engineering was. They suggested it to me because I had tested really high in math and science, so I was like cool, that sounds good. Then I had to choose between electrical, chemical, and mechanical - biomedical wasn’t even an option then - and I picked chemical because I enjoyed chemistry. That’s how I became an engineer,” said Mitchell.
After graduation, Mitchell worked for ExxonMobil in reservoir modeling, but medicine was always calling her name. A few years later, she decided to earn a Ph.D. and applied to three schools with three very different programs.
She eventually chose Georgia Tech and Emory University’s dual Ph.D. program in biomedical engineering, a choice that stemmed from her own personal experience and her new goals.
“Looking back, I can see the writing on the wall that was pointing the doctors to Devic’s disease. But in the middle of all of it, it was so hard to pair different symptoms together. I’m hoping that my work in predictive medicine will make patient care better, leading to quicker, more accurate diagnoses.”
Going for the Gold
While in college, Mitchell was spotted by a coach who took note of her wheelchair agility. He asked if she had ever played wheelchair basketball. Mitchell had played some basketball in high school, but had not yet attempted any sports as a disabled person.
She soon joined Oklahoma State’s team and played for four seasons before the severe progression of her paralysis and vision damage put a stop to her rising basketball career. Still, the time proved crucial to Mitchell both on and off of the court.
“My insurance wouldn’t cover me to go to rehab, so when I left the hospital for the first time I had no idea how to do anything,” said Mitchell.
“All my teammates during this time were amazing. My life had completely changed, but I had zero guidance on how to adapt. It was nice to be surrounded by other people with disabilities who taught me so many tricks and tips.”
She later tried quad rugby, which she dubbed “murderball,” but decided that she needed to play an individual sport. Playing an individual sport would allow Mitchell to simultaneously be an elite Team USA athlete and have a successful research and professional career. Mitchell chose to compete in paracycling and her first love, track and field.
Mitchell set a goal to reach the 2012 Paralympics and quickly started to win titles and set records in her new sports. In 2011, she became the first female quadriplegic Paracycling National and World Champion. Mitchell currently holds seven Para Athletics world records in female quadriplegic track and field events.
In 2012, she made Team USA and made her Paralympic debut in London, competing in the T52 100m & 200m and the F52 discus, placing 4th in each event.
Unsatisfied with her performance, Mitchell trained hard for the 2016 games. Shortly before the trials, Mitchell was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a rare blood cancer. Despite the diagnosis, Mitchell continued to train and made the team again, all while undergoing chemotherapy. In Rio, she took home a silver and a bronze medal in discus and club throw respectively. She has her eyes set on bringing home a gold in 2020.
Achieving the Three C’s
While most labs employ graduate students to assist with research, Mitchell made an unusual choice. Her lab mainly consists of undergraduates – sometimes up to 30 – along with a few graduate students.
“People told me I was crazy and could ruin my career by working with so many undergraduates, but the undergrads have been amazing. We now have a great system, and these students are like family to me.”
The lab focuses on predictive medicine and multi-factorial diseases, covering health issues like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s, obesity, asthma, cancer, and more. By combining machine learning, artificial intelligence, and biostatistics principles, they are able to achieve “the three C’s” – identify causes, develop cures, and optimize care.
“I didn’t want to only do work that helps people 30 years from now. I also want to make people’s lives better right now.”
Because big pharmaceutical companies don’t invest in ALS, Mitchell has spent a significant amount of time dedicated to this disease in particular, allowing her to make a big impact. The lab recently published an article that could change how soon Medicare distributes a certain machine for ALS patients, which could lead to extending their life by more than double.
Another aspect that makes Mitchell’s lab unique is its approach to algorithms. Instead of only developing new algorithms, they also take ones that have been put on a shelf, tune them up, and insert them into the pipeline to solve a biomedical problem.
“We’re more of applied machine learning, where we take pieces of methods, put them together in new ways, and try to solve a big puzzle. It’s challenging because creating a non-biomedical algorithm is hard enough, but add in all of the unpredictable biology and chemistry of the human body, and it gets even more difficult,” said Mitchell.
Always Look for the Good
Moving forward, Mitchell is excited to increase Georgia Tech’s level of accessibility and inclusion. She was selected as a 2019 Georgia Tech Diversity and Inclusion Fellow, and is helping to head up ABLE Alliance, Georgia Tech’s first accessibility organization.
“I think this campus is long overdue for an accessibility overhaul. There haven’t been a ton of resources out there, and I’ve had so many disabled students come through my door looking for help. Given that we are Georgia Tech, we can do so much to help our students be successful in this environment.”
The alliance was started last spring and will pick up steam this coming academic year.
Mitchell also volunteers as a counselor for people who have undergone similar trauma, including patients at the Shepherd Center Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation Hospital.
“I believe we have a choice about everything in our lives. Sure, I wouldn’t pick to be in a wheelchair, but I can choose to see the good in it. It’s a daily choice, and sometimes it’s easy and sometimes it’s hard. I try to help other people realize that the most important thing they can do every day is never give up.”
Georgia Tech Launches Online Master's Degree Program in Cybersecurity
The Georgia Institute of Technology has announced a new online cybersecurity master’s degree that will be offered for less than $10,000 and delivered in collaboration with edX. The Online Master of Science in Cybersecurity (OMS Cybersecurity) is designed to address a severe global workforce shortage in the field. According to the 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study, the shortage is expected to reach 1.8 million people by 2022.
Georgia Tech is the only nationally ranked Top 10 university to offer such a program at a tuition rate intended to increase higher education accessibility and affordability. The degree has existed on campus since 2002 and costs $20,000 for in-state students and $40,000 for those out-of-state. Applications for spring 2019 are open now until October 1.
The OMS Cybersecurity program will launch January 7, 2019 with 250 students and will scale over time to meet demand and student needs. The program is designed to serve working professionals who can study part-time and earn the degree within two to three years. It is richly technical and offers the same three interdisciplinary tracks available on campus beginning with information security and followed by policy and energy systems in fall 2019.
“Georgia Tech’s OMS Cybersecurity degree pairs world-class computer science, engineering, and public policy instruction with Georgia Tech Research Institute’s legacy of applied research in areas related to military, government, and law enforcement,” said Rafael L. Bras, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs and K. Harrison Brown Family Chair. "As demand continues to grow, Georgia Tech is proud to deliver innovative, affordable, top quality education in high-demand areas, like cybersecurity, to learners around the nation and world.”
OMS Cybersecurity is Georgia Tech’s third at-scale online degree program. It will follow the same model as the groundbreaking online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program, which launched in 2014 on Udacity with support from AT&T and has enrolled approximately 10,000 students overall for the $6,800 degree. The Institute followed on that success in 2017 by launching the Online Master of Science in Analytics on edX with support from AT&T and Accenture, which currently has 706 students in its second semester and costs less than $10,000.
Stackable, affordable, and accessible
“We are excited to strengthen our partnership with Georgia Tech by now offering two top-ranked online master’s degrees in high-demand fields to learners all over the world,” said Anant Agarwal, edX chief executive officer and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “The new OMS Cybersecurity follows on the success of the stacked OMS Analytics on edX, which offers learners the option to start with a MicroMasters program on edX that can count toward their full master’s degree. This collaboration with Georgia Tech is the latest milestone in creating stackable, affordable, and accessible online master’s degrees in subjects that address today’s global skill gaps.”
OMS Cybersecurity is built on the proven success of the on-campus Master of Science in Cybersecurity, which was started as a master’s degree in information security in 2002 by Mustaque Ahamad, associate director, Institute for Information Security & Privacy, professor, School of Computer Science, and co-founder and chief scientist at Pindrop, a cybersecurity company. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the cybersecurity field, the program was broadened to include tracks in energy systems and policy.
“The on-campus program has a long history as a world-class master’s degree in information security,” said Ahamad. “Graduates from this degree have gone on to become top leaders in the field.”
"Cybersecurity is a global problem,” said Milton Mueller, professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Public Policy, “The OMS format not only extends Georgia Tech's reach to American professionals in cybersecurity but also makes it possible for working professionals anywhere in the world to avail themselves of Tech's educational resources and expertise."
Workforce need, industry observation propel new degree
The U.S. will have 265,000 more cybersecurity jobs than skilled workers by 2022, as projected by the ISC Center for Cyber Safety and Education. Cybersecurity job postings continue to surge, having increased by 71 percent between 2012 and 2017. Job postings specifying a master’s degree have grown by 73 percent during the same period, based on data provided in the 2017 Burning Glass/Labor Insights Report. The report also cites the Washington D.C. metro area as ranking first in the country for cybersecurity employment opportunities with 44,244 job postings.
"As chief information security officers work to protect organizations from malicious cyber threats, they have difficulty finding trained people to staff their team. The cybersecurity workforce pipeline is a critical component to the future of our nation’s economic and national security posture. CISOs are excited to hear about Georgia Tech’s degree providing enhanced training and teaching multi-faceted skills for employment in the cybersecurity job market,” said Patrick Gaul, executive director of the National Technology Security Coalition.
OMS Cybersecurity is an interdisciplinary collaboration between Georgia Tech’s School of Computer Science in the College of Computing, the School of Public Policy in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering.
"The OMS Cybersecurity degree offers the same comprehensive, rigorous curriculum as the on-campus program," said Raheem Beyah, faculty lead for the program, Motorola Foundation Professor and associate chair for Strategic Initiatives and Innovation in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and co-founder of Fortiphyd Logic, Inc., an industrial control cybersecurity company. “Courses are taught by leaders in the field of cybersecurity research who are sought after by industry and government entities for their knowledge and expertise."
Courses for the program will be designed and produced for online delivery by Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE), the Institute’s lifelong learning arm that has provided professional education for more than 40 years.
“OMS Cybersecurity is designed for working professionals aiming to develop deep expertise in cybersecurity without interrupting their careers,” said Nelson Baker, dean of GTPE. “With this degree, we’re able to offer them the opportunity to build careers in a rapidly growing field while delivering cybersecurity experts to industry to address extreme workforce shortages.”

“The ICPC is a global community of universities and volunteers who come together to provide an opportunity for students of computing to develop excellence in problem-solving,” said Deputy ICPC Executive Director Jeff Donahoo, who is also a computer science professor at Baylor University.
“It is only fitting that our first NAC is being hosted by the Georgia Tech College of Computing, an institution known globally for excellence in research and education.”
The 55 regional teams from the United States and Canada competing in the 2020 ICPC NAC – each with three students and a coach – will vie for six challenge medals, rankings, and the chance to be the inaugural ICPC North America Champions.
Students, coaches, and others wanting to keep up with developments or share their experiences can use the hashtag #icpcNAC20 for the event.
The winning team, along with 2019 regional winners, will advance to the 2020 ICPC World Finals in Moscow. Teams winning a wildcard or one of six challenge medals will also move on to the finals, scheduled for June 21-26.
The ICPC is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. The ICPC operates under the auspices of the ICPC Foundation, which was founded to advance the art and sport of competitive programming for the benefit of society. More than 320,000 students have competed in ICPC since it began in 1970. In 2018, nearly 53,000 students from more than 3,200 universities in 110 countries participated in ICPC events.
While You Were Away: GT Computing 2019 Summer Highlights
Whether you were interning, traveling, building Star Wars sand sculptures, or binge-watching Black Mirror, chances are you weren't fully tuned into the College this summer.
Not to worry. We're here to catch you up on all of the big stories you may have missed.
Probably the biggest news this summer, nay, this year is that the College has a new dean. Stepping up from the faculty ranks, Charles Isbell took the helm as the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing on July 1. He is the fourth person to hold this position.
His philosophy as dean is built on the foundation he laid long ago as an undergraduate.
“To me, it’s all about community,” he said. “I want people to feel like they belong, and that the community reflects their experiences. I want people to feel that the things they’re learning apply to their worlds.”

Suitable for Framing: Galil Portrait 'Captures Something Real'
Before we could welcome Dean Isbell, we had to say farewell to Dean Zvi Galil. Galil stepped down as the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing in June following his announcement in 2018.
Galil became GT Computing dean in July 2010. Under his leadership, the College has seen significant enrollment growth at the undergraduate and graduate levels, achievement in interdisciplinary research and thought leadership, goal-breaking fundraising efforts, and the development and continued success of the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program.

Graduate Fellowship Fund Honors CS Alum
The College celebrated the life and memory of Sastry V. Nanduri this summer by establishing a graduate fellowship fund in his name. An alumnus, entrepreneur, and former College advisory board member, Nanduri passed away last year.
He was passionate about solving real-world problems, and a mentor and teacher who sought to share his passions with others.
Interim Chairs to Guide Schools During Search Process
In June, the names of interim chairs were announced for two of the College of Computing’s three schools. Srinivas Aluru began as interim chair of the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) in June, while Mostafa Ammar began earlier this month as interim chair of the School of Computer Science (SCS).

Alumnae Receive Prestigious Awards at CHI 2019
Just as the Spring 2019 semester was wrapping up, two alumnae were recognized by the CHI community in Glasgow, U.K., one for her overall contributions in human-computer interaction at the conference, and another for her long history of promoting social action within the community.
Jennifer Mankoff, one of Professor Gregory Abowd’s first of 30 Ph.D graduates in 2001, was inducted into the prestigious CHI Academy this week, and Gillian Hayes (2007), also advised by Abowd, was awarded the Social Impact award.
Queer in AI Fosters Inclusion in the Research Community
Gender bias is one of the most pressing issues in artificial intelligence (AI) today, but what if even just sorting data by gender is part of the problem? This question is one of many that the group Queer in AI asks.
College of Computing alumnus and Google AI Resident Rapha Gontijo Lopes co-founded the group in 2018 to create a community for queer researchers and to raise awareness of LGBTQIA+ issues in AI and machine learning (ML).
New Approach Cuts Time Needed for Genomic Testing
From disease-causing organisms to mutations caused by cancer, the first step in diagnosing many health concerns often begins with identifying variations in genomes. But, this can take several days with existing technology.
A new algorithm developed at Georgia Tech, however, is shifting this paradigm by dramatically reducing the time it takes to identify genomic variations in a cell or organism to just a few hours or even minutes.
Samira Samadi Researches Theory that Can Help Everyone
When Samira Samadi was in her third year of college, she took a class on the theory of computation where she learned about the Turing machine. The Church-Turing thesis, named after two renowned mathematicians, states that a simple abstract machine can determine any algorithmically solvable problem. The class was life-changing for the Sharif University of Technology mathematics student.
“It was super cool that such a simple structure can describe any algorithm or computation that a computer or a human could do,” she said. “It was a window for me that what I study could go far beyond the abstract. I could do great things with it.”

Frogger Used to Demo Breakthrough Explainable AI
Why did the frog cross the road? Well, a new artificial intelligent (AI) agent that can play the classic arcade game Frogger not only can tell you why it crossed the road, but it can justify its moves in everyday language.
Developed by Georgia Tech, in collaboration with Cornell and the University of Kentucky, the work enables an AI agent to provide a rationale for a mistake or errant behavior, and to explain it in a way that is easy for non-experts to understand.
“If the power of AI is to be democratized, it needs to be accessible to anyone regardless of their technical abilities,” said Upol Ehsan, Ph.D. student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech and lead researcher.

CS Majors Helping Automate a Safe Return to In-person Work and School
A new automated tool that uses the latest Covid-19 health and safety research is on track to help organizations plan and implement a safe return to in-person work and school amid the pandemic.
Called Rotations, the web-based platform was selected on Jan. 28 as the winning concept for Hack Covid-19, a student hackathon organized by Emory Global Health Institute and Georgia Tech. The winning team includes two Georgia Tech computer science (CS) majors.
Rotations is an automated schedule generator that helps mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in shared workspaces. According to its developers, the tool uses current health and safety data to auto-generate schedules, as well as suggested seating layouts, optimized to keep returning in-person employees and students safe.
“We put ourselves in the place of an office manager or school administrator and asked, ‘What kind of tool could make returning to in-person functions as easy as possible and how could we minimize the spread of the virus as much as possible at the same time?’” said Arvin Poddar, Rotations team member and third-year Georgia Tech CS major.
The schedules and seating charts output by the platform are customizable based on variables unique to a particular workspace. These can include a maximum number of people, square footage of a room, ventilation, and other factors. These data points are also used to calculate a safety score that integrates available research resources.
“We are trying to change the game by looking at the research and seeing how floor layouts can truly be optimized with data,” said Merissa Coleman, team member and a third-year human health major from Emory University.
Another feature that helps mitigate the spread of the virus is the platform’s ability to automatically stagger arrival times for in-person employees. This helps to minimize contact and ensure proper social distancing. If someone does report contracting Covid-19, the platform has a contact tracing function that will automatically alert all of those that were in recent contact with that person.
“We wanted the product to be applicable to both management and employees. So, along with being easy to use, we wanted to be able to give peace of mind to those returning to the office and the classroom,” said Coleman.
As the winners of the Hack Covid-19 competition, Coleman, Poddar, and teammate Ryan Cobelli – also a Georgia Tech CS major – receive a $3,500 cash prize and earn a spot in the CREATE-X Startup Launch program this summer. CREATE-X is Georgia Tech’s entrepreneurial accelerator for students that helps develop projects like Rotations into business startups.
“As we know, Covid is changing every day and the situation is evolving. So, we are really looking forward to developing this product into something that people can really use,” said Poddar.
A primary feature that the team would like to develop while participating in the Startup Launch program is direct integration of the Rotations tool. Being able to directly connect with systems that schools and businesses already use will do away with the current need for administrators to manually upload .csv files to develop rosters.
Beyond this, Poddar sees potential for even more integration with existing systems.
“Ultimately, maybe Rotations doesn’t even need to be its own stand-alone platform. Maybe it could be directly integrated into an existing HR system or learning management platform,” said Poddar.

From the Dean's Desk - Aug. 18, 2020
Dear GT Computing community,
I am pleased to note that Vivek Sarkar has officially taken over as the chair of the School of Computer Science as of this week. With Haesun Park in place as chair of Computational Science and Engineering as of last week, we now have our full slate of school leadership in place. Also, not for nothing, but I am very pleased to note that out of our four schools and divisions, three are now headed by women. The College is modeling what it means to create excellence by bringing together a diverse group of leaders, something we know we need across our entire field.
I would like once again to thank Srinivas Aluru and Mostafa Ammar for serving as interim chairs for CSE and SCS for the past year. I would say that we will miss their leadership, but we have nothing to worry about there. Srinivas will continue in his role as Executive Director of IDEAS, and Mostafa is sticking around to help the College launch our new School for Cybersecurity and Privacy. He will be working with Mustaque Ahamad and Wenke Lee, as well as other faculty across the Institute, to help build SCP in preparation for the day it fully opens its doors.
On a more prosaic note, I want to remind everyone who comes into campus to pick up their Institute-provided PPE, namely two masks and a personal refillable bottle of hand sanitizer. The locations for each building are as follows:
- Coda: Floor 12E, Coda Support Services Team. Please call (404) 374-7378 and wait outside the of the CSS glass doors for service.
- CCB: CCB Mailroom 033
- Klaus: CCB Mailroom 033
- TSRB: Cori Wilson, Room 211
There have been some other changes to our operations now that we have students back on campus; please consult our business continuity webpage for updates on building access, deliveries, facilities and mail.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - Aug. 3, 2021
There are so many things going on as we prepare to work our way back to campus.
First off, let me thank all the folks crafting return-to-campus plans. We seem to be converging on a reasonable starting place, and that’s happening because of everyone working together thoughtfully.
Speaking of back to campus, you may have seen a note from President Cabrera in your e-mail inbox recently. He has asked that everyone consider wearing a mask while on campus. Please note that this is not a mask mandate: because GT is a state entity, the belief is that we are not subject to the City of Atlanta’s mask mandate. I’m not sure where this is all going to end up, but the conversations are ongoing. In the meantime, I would like to echo the President and encourage you to be thoughtful about wearing a mask. Stay informed and aware as facts are changing on the ground day by day.
Oh! I know I sent a dispatch about the new NSF AI institutes last week, but for more context, I encourage you to read President Cabrera’s message to alumni about AI at Georgia Tech. There’s a bit of CoC history (I’m looking at you Ron) and a description of the bright future ahead.
In other good news, our own Srinivas Aluru has been named editor-in-chief of the journal IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. His appointment will start on August 1 and run through December 2024. Please join me in congratulating Srinivas for his intellectual leadership.
Finally, I’d like to mention Highcharts Sonification Studio, Bruce Walker’s (IC) new open-source tool for the sonification of charts. This research makes it possible to listen to data as well as look at it, which, um, sounds amazing. It is clearly beneficial to everyone and a real boon to those with visual impairments.
So there you go. There’s a week and a semester ahead of us. Take some time to stomp your feet, shake your groove thing, or, you know what?, do the conga. Or do what I’m going to try to do sometime this century and just rest. I shall see you before too long.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - July 13, 2021
Dear GT Computing community,
It’s July, and that means it’s beginning to feel like summer. It’s July 2021, and that means we’re coming up on the long-awaited return to campus. I’d like to take a moment to talk a little bit about how that will likely look. Of course, the details will vary from group to group and person to person, but we can see the outline for the rest of the year.
First, there’s the timing. Classes begin for the Fall semester on Monday, August 23. This is the key date around which most of our plans must revolve. In particular, the students will be fully back on campus studenting. As such, all of us across the entire campus have to plan to engage fully with them by then. Some of us will have to engage even before then in order to prepare for their arrival. Actually, many of us are on campus now (quite literally today) managing our once-again-in-person FASET meetings with parents and new students.
Second, I think we all know work will look a little different this Fall and it will continue to evolve over the rest of the year. Just as with timing, how we return to campus will likely look different for different groups. I am empowering different offices and supervisors across the College to create plans for their teams consistent with what we know is allowed by GT and USG rules. Our goal is to be at least as—and even more—flexible than we were pre-COVID on the one hand but to also make sure that our plans for each team across the College allows us to serve our constituents even more effectively and efficiently. Online and virtual services are wonderful, but they absolutely mean that more, not fewer, will take advantage of these services. We need each group to think deeply about what you do and how best to be effective in this new environment.
Finally, I’d like to reiterate the Institute’s rules around masking and social distancing. Outside of labs, no one can require another person to wear a mask. You may not put up signs asking visitors to your offices or spaces to wear masks. Now, it may be within your good judgment to wear a mask yourself, and if so I encourage you to do so. But we must follow Institute rules on this matter.
And there we go. We have a little bit of thought and effort ahead of us, but I believe that if we work together we’ll end up in a better place for everyone in the GT family eventually.
Oh, before I let you go, I would like to share that one of our graduates, Andrea Fletcher (BS CS ’16), has been profiled in the Wall Street Journal, talking about her dream career working for Roblox. As we all work through our worries about going back to work, let us remember that we are making dreams come true. It’s worth it.
So keep that difference you make in the lives of so many in mind for the next month or year or decade or so. And for now, enjoy the weather, get out and play, see your friends and family. Be safe. I’ll see you soon.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - July 20, 2021
Dear GT Computing community,
I’ve got some good news today. Georgia Tech has just been rated #5 globally for computer science research by Guide2Research.com.
Now, there are a lot of rankings out there, but this one is particularly interesting because it’s based on our collective h-index. For those who don’t know, the h-index is a measurement that tracks how much a researcher publishes and (importantly) how many other researchers are citing their work. It is a kind of shorthand for our intellectual influence.
As we all know, rankings are useless, except the ones I like, and I like this one because it shows that the research we do here is influential.
In other good news, the College of Computing has three alumni on this year's 40 under 40 list:
- Mahdi Al-Husseini (MS CS '20), an aeromedical evacuations officer for the U.S. Army who also develops technology and policy for aviation safety.
- Vanessa Larco (BS CS '08), venture capitalist and founding member of LatinXVC, a group to help Latinos enter venture capitalism.
- Dhawal Shah (MS CS '10), CEO of Class Central, a website that has matched more than 40 million users to online education programs.
Finally, I’m starting to hear from teams across the College who are formulating their work plans for fall. Please continue working with your supervisors as they fill out the details.
So there you go. Have a good week. Find some time to take it easy. Take a moment and go for a drive, spend time with your friends and your family. I’ll see you back here next week. I have to go catch a plane.
Peace.

Dean's Desk - July 27, 2021
Dear GT Computing community,
It’s the last day of summer classes, and we are all turning our attention to the fall semester, and to our return to campus.
I’m sure everyone is working with their supervisors to hammer out their work arrangements for the fall. As is always the case, different groups have different needs and different responsibilities, so plans may be a little different from one group to another; however, I do expect some strong commonalities:
- Fall classes start on August 23, so plan to “start” next month, probably close to August 16 for most of us.
- In the Before Times(tm) we were allowed one work-from-home day a week as a default, and I expect most of us will be able to see that rise to two as a default. For some, that increase will not work out (just as one day a week did not for every group). Some will be able to make an extraordinarily good case showing that more remote work will improve productivity.
- Things happen, so I expect each team to have on-campus coverage every day.
No matter where we end up, these plans must reflect what’s best for each group and will require that as groups we will work together to make the right thing happen. Speaking of where we end up, this is just the first step. I very much expect that both CoC and the Institute will be able to revisit these plans before the end of the year as we figure out what works, and put in the infrastructure to help us to work better, remotely or otherwise.
I know the return to campus can be a source of uncertainty and irritation, but we’ll figure it out. More importantly, it’s not all uncertainty and irritation. I suspect many of you are very happy at the thought that we will be together again. I know I am. In fact, we are planning a year of celebration with events, T-shirts and more. Our theme is the Power of Two, capturing what we can accomplish when we come together to pursue our common goals. We have shown that power through the last year, pulling together through crisis after crisis, and I want to celebrate how that energy will carry us to new heights moving forward. More on the nerdy future events later.
In the meantime, let me end by noting that our own Andrea Grimes Parker (SIC) is co-PI on a $2.4 million grant to develop a virtual health counselor called Clara. Clara is designed to address vaccine hesitancy and will be piloted in 12 Black churches in Boston. Please join me in thanking Andrea for her intellectual leadership, and for her work using technology for the public good.
That’s all for today. Have a good week, and make sure you take some time to relax. Head out to the country, or into the city, or just stay home and relax. I shall see you here next week.
Peace.

Sonia Chernova (SIC) is the PI and Beth Mynatt is the co-PI of the NSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups (AI-CARING). The AI-CARING institute aims to develop new longitudinal, collaborative AI systems that work with aging adults, including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and their caregivers.
Both of these Institutes build on decades of our research, and both will not only create novel technologies but also train a new generation of researchers. Here in the College of Computing, we strive to build new technologies that improve the human condition, and these Institutes embody that ethos to a T (stolen by the students or otherwise).
Please join me in congratulating Sonia, Beth and Ashok for their intellectual leadership. Congratulations also to Pascal Van Hentenryck of ISyE, who is the PI for the NSF AI Institute for Advances in Optimization (AI4Opt).
These grants, $60 million in total, rest on literal decades of work on AI, aging, and education in the College. They are also at the leading edge of a new wave of investment in AI at Georgia Tech. We are expected to hire 100 new AI researchers in the field over the next few years. CoC is also investing not only in faculty but in graduate fellowships and in new courses teaching AI as a tool for science and engineering.
I couldn’t be more proud of our achievements in AI, and I can’t wait to see what this expansion allows us to do next. We’ve got a lot to celebrate, so enjoy the good times and I will see you back here next week.
Peace.

Dear GT Computing community,
It’s a beautiful day here in Atlanta, and the birds are out singing to celebrate a new fiscal year and the great renewal that comes with it. I’m going to join our avian colleagues and talk today about some changes we are making in the College in order to build on our past successes and set us up for the future. In short, we are expanding and restructuring our Office of Outreach, Enrollment, and Community.
As you know, one of the key strengths of the College is its community. Our community is broad: it includes students, faculty, staff, and alumni, but also those who are joining the field of computing through our outreach efforts. For more than a decade, OEC has spearheaded and supported many of these community efforts. Sometimes quite visibly, sometimes quietly, but always with energy and passion.
OEC has grown dramatically just as our community has grown, and just as the importance of computing has grown. To manage this growth and to increase our impact, we are strengthening all parts of OEC:
- Our corporate and alumni support operations will join the Office of Development. We have partnered with the GT Alumni Association to focus on our young alumni especially and to formalize the pilot programs we have started in the last two years.
- Many of our various internal community, wellness, and enrichment programs will come together in an organization that will report up through Irfan Essa, our Senior Associate Dean.
- Similarly, our many outreach programs in OEC and Constellations will also come together. This restructuring will consolidate the logistical and organizational support that touches so many of our efforts across the College. One important consequence is that the event coordinators from OEC and Communications will come together into a college-level event management group.
All in all, these developments are good for the College and the amazing folks who have worked on these efforts. They will set up for our next wave of growth (I say next but it’s already here) and support our strategic goals, including our focus on increasing the diversity of and access to the field of computing at every stage in the pipeline. The new outreach group will strengthen and add to our existing programs for diversifying the field, which is good for us and for the larger community.
While we’re on the subject of renewal, I have another somewhat mixed announcement to make: Brad Hastings, our exceptional Senior Director of Development, has agreed to serve as the Executive Director of Development for the College of Engineering going forward. That’s good news for CoE but, well, let’s just say I have a few other feelings as well. Having said that, Brad has graciously agreed to continue in his role with CoC for the foreseeable future while we transition to the upcoming campaign.
So there you go. Please enjoy the week ahead. Take some time to sing a song, to dance like no one’s watching (because as I cannot emphasize enough no one is), or just to enjoy the morning sun. I’ll see you again soon, maybe even in person.
Peace.

From the Dean's Desk - June 1, 2020
I’ve thought a lot about it since, but at the time all I could think was: “That’s a really big gun.”
I was at a capital-T Traffic Stop somewhere outside of Cambridge, MA. A police officer was approaching me on the driver’s side and for some reason he went for his gun and yelled at me to be still. I got… stiller… and eventually it was all over and I drove away.
Only later, while trying to calm down my friends did I think, “He could have killed me”.
I’m not sure exactly when that changed to “…and he would have gotten away with it”. I think it was April 29, 1992. That was a day much like the days we’re experiencing now.
In the many years since, my thoughts have returned to that night. They became “…and would anyone have heard about it?” They became, “…and if they did what would they have heard?” Would the reports say I led a high speed chase? Would the pundits say that if only I’d complied, I’d be alive? What would they have dredged up? Maybe somehow that time in seventh grade when I checked out Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret from the library would be held against me.
I don’t know, but it would have been something, and it would be like dying twice.
It’s not always the Traffic Stop. Sometimes I think about the time that guy in the pick up truck spit on me, or the confrontation with the police while I was house hunting. A few weeks ago, I was sitting on a curb in my embarrassingly sprawling neighborhood and someone in a truck drove by, stopped maybe 40 yards away, backed up and stared at me for five or six seconds, then left. “What was that about? What could it have been about?”
My son is 12, all arms and legs. Studies tell me that when he walks down the street, he’ll be more likely mistaken for 16. His 12-year old movements will be threatening. I know: I’ve already had that conversation with teachers.
Yesterday, I sat in my car with him and we talked about what’s going on, and this is neither the first nor second such conversation. He doesn’t quite believe what’s happening, but he believes it more every time we have this conversation. I know he’ll believe it more the next time we are here, the next time someone utters a racial epithet around him. This is a reality I went through, and I know it’s a reality he’ll go through.
My thoughts nowadays are more about him. He’s one candy bar away from “Gun!” and being shot. He’s a moment away from “He should have complied” and “He was no saint” and whatever else they would say. It wouldn’t be true, not this boy who interrupts my meetings to hug me and ask me if he can have apple juice, but I know it would be said.
Of course, I think about other things. In so many ways, my life is great… and I have a lot to do, so I go back to the business of getting through my life and resigning myself to the fact that I really do have to do my taxes this weekend. But the thoughts always come back.
You know what I’m thinking now? As I write this, I’m sitting in my office and I’m looking out at my city. I can see the campus, I can see midtown and downtown, buildings poking out above all the many trees. But I don’t see smoke. I don’t see broken windows. I don’t see all the stories out there. I know that right over there two college kids from Spelman and Morehouse were dragged from their car and tased during the demonstrations this weekend, and I’m sure there are other stories, and some of them probably ended even worse. I know most of them were never recorded, never noted by the public.
I don’t see your story either, but I know you have one. We all do. That’s mostly what I think about at times like these. Everyone has a story. I may not see yours any more than you see mine, but I know you have one.
In the end it’s what binds us together. We all have stories and as often as not they are similar in some important way. It’s how we know we are human together.
And when they are different? Well that’s even more important. Those differences also tell us about each other, even when they are so different that they seem hard to imagine.
Either way, these stories make us the community we are. It is, simply, fundamentally true. And when we realize it, we can change things. It really doesn’t have to be the way it’s always been. We can make it better as a community. In fact, we must.
Look, it’s been a long few weeks, and a very long weekend. Please, stay safe. I’d like to hear you tell your story one day.
Peace.

Students who wish to pursue a Master's degree in Bioengineering may do so through the College of Computing. The specific requirements differ from those of the computer science master's program, and while the degree is granted from the College, applications for this program are processed through Georgia Tech's Bioengineering Center in the Office of Interdisciplinary Programs.
Visit the MS Bioengineering degree website for program details.
Master of Science in Computational Science & Engineering - Distance Learning
The CSE master's degree program includes an option to take most courses through Georgia Tech Professional Education. Students do not need to physically reside on the Atlanta campus while taking coursework through Professional Education.
Students must register as an "online student" in semesters when taking one or more courses, and all courses taken during those semesters should be courses through Professional Education. In other words, one cannot take some courses on campus and others through Professional Education during the same semester.
Students should carefully evaluate the course offerings provided through Georgia Tech Professional Education before applying as an online student. While most courses with a CSE course designation are offered through Professional Education, many specialization courses are only offered on campus.
The CSE program handbook includes information concerning specific specialization courses that have been offered through Professional Education in the past (see the appendices in the handbook listing specialization courses). Prospective students may wish to consult with a CSE program advisor to determine if a specific set of courses may be used to fulfill M.S. CSE degree requirements.
Master of Science in Computer Science
Graduates receive the MSCS for completing one of three options in the program as described in the program of study. The program is designed for students who possess a bachelor's degree in computer science from an accredited institution. Students with a bachelor's degree in other than computer science are encouraged to apply as well, with the understanding that they may be required to complete remedial course work in addition to the requirements of the M.S. CS degree.
Admissions
Admission to the program is highly selective; there are many more qualified applicants than there are places in the program. The challenge for the College every year is to select a class from a highly qualified pool. The College looks for compelling reasons to admit candidates, and the statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, test scores and GPA are all reviewed carefully. Having a strong undergraduate background in computer science, including C programming, is highly recommended for applicants. The Admissions Committee welcomes additional pertinent information that will aid in making objective and informed decisions.
Students are admitted to the master's program only once a year. The application deadline is Feb. 1 for admission to the following fall semester.
Learn important information about our admissions process on our Admissions Requirements page.

Program of Study
The degree requires 36 credit hours, which are taken over four semesters. All students take the same core courses, a set of courses related to their chosen specialization (Computing, Digital Media in LMC, Industrial Design, Psychology), a broader set of electives and complete a master’s project. Students complete an internship in the summer after their first year of study.
Elective courses can be in a wide variety of areas, such as Architecture, Music Technology, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Computer Science, Human-Robot Interaction, Human Factors, Management of Technology and Cognitive Science. Students can earn the Management of Technology Certificate from the College of Management.
More than 50 faculty work in these and closely-related areas, and are associated with research labs and centers such as the GVU Center, the Institute for People and Technology, the Aware Home, the Interactive Media Technology Center, the Sonification Lab, GTRI and many more.

This 36 credit-hour, cohort-based program is a professional Master of Science in Robotics over four semesters designed to produce industry-ready engineers and scientists with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills needed to meet the challenges of rapidly growing interdisciplinary technologies in professional careers related to designing and developing robotics and automation solutions. Such a program is in high demand by not only students but also a growing list of local and global companies interested in robotics and factory automation.
The MS Robotics program provides its graduates with a practitioner-oriented degree that clearly distinguishes them as trained professionals in the field. Its curriculum is specifically tailored to the educational needs for robotics professionals by requiring courses in multiple core areas of Robotics (e.g., AI and Mechanics). In addition to coursework, the students will spend a summer performing internship at one of our industrial robotics partners, and complete a capstone project providing them with practical experience directly applicable to their careers.
How to Apply
The MS-Robotics program is offered collaboratively by six schools in the Colleges of Computing, Engineering and Sciences:
- Electrical & Computer Engineering
- Mechanical Engineering
- Aerospace Engineering
- Biomedical Engineering
- Interactive Computing
- Physics
Students can apply to the MS-Robotics program through any of the six participating schools, the choice of which usually reflects that student's intended area of specialization and general background. Students with diverse and eclectic backgrounds are encouraged to apply, including those with previous work or research experience. Each school has its own set of admission criteria but the program generally requires a minimum GPA of 3.3.
Program of Study
The program requires 36 hours of letter-grade coursework with a minimum GPA of 3.0. A maximum of two classes (6 semester hours) at the 4000 level (undergraduate) may be used as free electives toward the required 36 credit hours.

M.S. Computational Science and Engineering
Georgia Tech’s interdisciplinary Master of Science degree in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) is devoted to the creation, study, and application of computer-based models of natural and engineered systems. M.S. CSE graduates are exceptionally prepared for careers in industry, government, and academia.
The program is offered with the option to take portions, or in some instances, all of the coursework off-campus via Georgia Tech Professional Education.
The curriculum has been structured to impart students with solid CSE foundational knowledge and skills. It includes technical specialization courses that enhance a student's domain expertise. Advanced elective courses will enable students to specialize in a domain and technical expertise focusing on their particular interests. The optional thesis portion of the program requires the completion of an interdisciplinary research project.
Admissions Requirements
Interested in applying for the M.S. CSE program? Submit an application through Georgia Tech admissions and be sure to designate a home unit.
Keep in mind:
- Most students entering the CSE graduate degree programs will have obtained a bachelor's degree in a technical field, e.g., computer science, mathematics, or a science or engineering discipline.
- Students should have taken undergraduate calculus courses. Some CSE courses will require additional coursework in topics such as linear algebra or differential equations.
- Working knowledge of probability and statistics will also be helpful in some core courses and specializations.
- Students should have taken at least one course, but preferably two, and have developed a proficiency in programming in a high-level language such as C, FORTRAN or Java.
- Students deficient in one or more of these areas may still gain admission but should expect to take some additional coursework.

Program of Study
If you are interested in applying into the Ph.D. in CSE program, the program of study information will inform you of the hours and course-load required to complete the program.
CSE Qualifying Examination
This examination is designed to ensure the student has achieved sufficient knowledge in core areas of computational science and engineering as well as in their chosen specialization area as preparation for advanced research.
- Written qualifying exam: This written exam encompasses core areas of Computational Science and Engineering. Students select two areas among numerical methods, discrete algorithms, modeling and simulation, computational data analysis, and high performance computing. Material covered by the examination will normally include topics covered in core courses in the core area augmented with a reading list provided to the student as preparation for the examination. The format is a day-long written examination.
- Specialization exam and artifact defense: This portion of the exam has two purposes: to ensure that the student has acquired sufficient knowledge in his/her specialization area in a computing, engineering or science discipline for advanced research, and to ensure that the student can demonstrate an ability to integrate knowledge in mathematical foundations/computational methods and knowledge in a specific engineering or science discipline to synthesize a concrete computational artifact, e.g., a significant computer program. Specifics concerning the specialization exam and artifact defense depend on the home unit.
The qualifying exam must be attempted by the end of the second year of enrollment in the CSE doctoral program and in some home units the exam must be passed by the end of the second year. Please refer to the CSE graduate student handbook for detailed information.
CSE Doctoral Dissertation
The doctoral dissertation (thesis) forms a central component of the CSE Ph.D. program. Students must demonstrate the ability to perform independent research in collaboration with a faculty advisor that can be defended to a committee of faculty. To complete the doctoral thesis, students must complete three principal milestones: the Ph.D. proposal defense, the Ph.D. dissertation, and the Ph.D. dissertation defense.
Ph.D. in Computer Science
All students in the program receive the same degree regardless of their interest area, specialization, research focus or school affiliation. New students are affiliated with the school in which their advisor resides, but none of the schools impose any special requirements compared to another.
As a research-oriented degree, the Ph.D. in Computer Science prepares exceptional students for careers at the cutting edge of academia, industry and government. Students are expected to demonstrate excellence in both defining and executing a substantial research project that forms a novel contribution to the state of the art in computing. With a highly individualized program of study, the degree provides students with depth in their chosen research area coupled with a rigorous breadth of knowledge across the discipline.
First granting the doctoral degree in 1969 (as a Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science), the College of Computing represents a continuation of one of the earliest and most well-established graduate Computing institutions in the United States, and in the world. This stature is reflected in our national and international rankings and, most importantly, in the quality of the students who have graduated from our program.
The CS Ph.D. Structure
The coursework component of the Computer Science Ph.D. consists of an introductory course on graduate studies (CS 7001), along with the separate breadth and minor requirements.
The breadth requirement is intended to give students a broad competency across the discipline of computing through coursework in a range of the College's different research areas. This requirement is satisfied by taking five classes from across the College's different research areas and must include a Programming Proficiency course and a Theory course.
The minor is a 9-hour sequence of courses from outside the College that constitutes a coherent program of study and is determined by the student and advisor. The minor builds non-Computing expertise in an area related to the student's core research area.
As students progress, they must select a primary area of research and pass a qualifier (comprehensive exam) in that area to demonstrate mastery of the field in their chosen area, and readiness to do research.
While coursework plays an important role in the Ph.D., by far the most important component of the degree is the student's individual dissertation research project. This project should contribute to new knowledge in the field of computing, and should demonstrate the student's proficiency in defining and executing a compelling research agenda.
The dissertation research plan is formalized in a written proposal followed by an oral presentation. When a student passes his or her proposal, the student is admitted to candidacy and proceeds with the dissertation research, which is completed with the successful defense and submission of the approved doctoral dissertation.

NLP Seminar: Addressing Biases for Robust, Generalizable AI
Speaker: Swabha Swayamdipta
Time: 02/12/2021, 12.30pm - 1.30pm

Title: Addressing Biases for Robust, Generalizable AI
Abstract:
Artificial Intelligence has made unprecedented progress in the past decade. However, there still remains a large gap between the decision-making capabilities of humans and machines. In this talk, I will investigate two factors to explain why. First, I will discuss the presence of undesirable biases in datasets, which ultimately hurt generalization. I will then present bias mitigation algorithms that boost the ability of AI models to generalize to unseen data. Second, I will explore task-specific prior knowledge which aids robust generalization, but is often ignored when training modern AI architectures. Throughout this discussion, I will focus my attention on language applications, and will show how certain underlying structures can provide useful biases for inferring meaning in natural language. I will conclude with a discussion of how the broader framework of dataset and model biases will play a critical role in the societal impact of AI, going forward.
Bio:
Swabha Swayamdipta is a postdoctoral investigator at the Allen Institute for AI, working with Yejin Choi. Her research focuses on natural language processing, where she explores dataset and linguistic structural biases, and model interpretability.

SCP/SCS Seminar Talk: Aayush Jain
TITLE: Provably Secure Indistinguishability Obfuscation
ABSTRACT:
In this talk, we will cover some exciting progress on the problem of Indistinguishability Obfuscation (proposed by Barak et. al. 2001). In a nutshell, an Indistinguishability Obfuscation scheme is an efficient compiler that takes as input a program and outputs a new program with the same input-behavior and only a polynomial slowdown, but in addition, we have the guarantee that the new program reveals minimal information about the original program.
If realized securely and efficiently, such an obfuscation scheme would have huge consequences to both theory and practice. However, until now we did not know if it exists under any reasonably well-believed conjecture. Our work places iO onto “terra-firma”, by giving a construction that is as secure as several well-studied mathematical problems that are widely believed to be extremely hard to solve.
In this talk, we will hear about indistinguishability obfuscation, why it is useful, how it can be constructed, and future work.
BIO:
Aayush Jain is a final year Ph.D. student, advised by Amit Sahai at UCLA. He is interested in research questions in cryptography and their wonderful connections with related areas in computer science.
His most notable contribution is the first construction of Program Obfuscation whose security rests upon four well-studied hard problems. This problem was widely considered to be one of the most consequential open problems in cryptography. His work on this problem has been the subject of an invited tutorial at FOCS 2020, an article in Quanta magazine, and a Simons Institute Workshop. His research is recognized by a Google PhD Fellowship (2018-present), a Dean’s Fellowship (2016), and the 2020 Symantec Outstanding Graduate Research Award at UCLA.

Title: Big Data is Low Rank
Abstract: Data scientists are often faced with the challenge of understanding a high dimensional data set organized as a table. These tables may have columns of different (sometimes, non-numeric) types, and often have many missing entries. In this talk, we discuss how to use low rank models to analyze these big messy data sets.
Low rank models perform well --- indeed, suspiciously well — across a wide range of data science applications, including applications in social science, medicine, and machine learning. In this talk, we introduce the mathematics of low rank models, demonstrate a few surprising applications of low rank models in data science, and present a simple mathematical explanation for their effectiveness.
Bio: Madeleine Udell is Assistant Professor of Operations Research and Information Engineering and Richard and Sybil Smith Sesquicentennial Fellow at Cornell University. She studies optimization and machine learning for large scale data analysis and control, with applications in marketing, demographic modeling, medical informatics, engineering system design, and automated machine learning. She has received several awards, including an NSF CAREER award (2020), an Office of Naval Research (ONR) Young Investigator Award (2020), and an INFORMS Optimization Society Best Student Paper Award (as advisor) (2019).

SCS Seminar Talk: Alberto Dainotti
TITLE: Detecting and Visualizing Internet Failures: From Measurements to Streaming Analytics
ABSTRACT:
Our society's dependence on the internet is unquestioned. Yet our ability to manage the risks associated with relying on the proper functioning of the internet's core infrastructure is hindered by a poor understanding of how it can fail. For example, we lack a thorough understanding of when/where/how/why large connectivity failures happen; or we rely on a global routing system that is extremely vulnerable and we do not know to what extent it is exploited, by whom, and for what purposes. My research tries to address these questions by acquiring empirical evidence (e.g., on network status and misuse) on a global scale and longitudinally.
In this talk I will first describe an approach I developed to gather unprecedented insight into episodes of connectivity disruption, which is based on two intuitions: the opportunity to extract (connectivity liveness) "signals" from so-called "Internet background noise" traffic and the benefit of combining different types of control-plane and data-plane measurements. I then discuss how this inspired me to build a system (IODA,ioda.caida.org) to monitor the Internet for large-scale connectivity outages. IODA can detect Internet outages worldwide within minutes, continuously updating and monitoring hundreds of thousands of time series. IODA serves both as a research testbed and as a public service that provides automatically generated alerts and visualizations. This effort has enabled further research in multiple directions, facilitated interdisciplinary collaborations, and resulted in the engagement of industry, government, and civil society.
I will conclude my talk by briefly discussing my other ongoing and future research efforts to understand and remediate Internet infrastructural issues and weaknesses.

Title: Competitive optimization, statistical inference, and fast solvers
Abstract: In this talk, we will use perspectives from game theory and statistical inference to design simple, novel, and efficient algorithms for classical problems in computational science.
In the first part of the talk, we propose competitive gradient descent (CGD) as a natural generalization of gradient descent to saddle point problems and general zero-sum games. Whereas gradient descent minimizes a local linear approximation at each step, CGD uses the Nash equilibrium of a local bilinear approximation. Explicitly accounting for agent interaction significantly improves the convergence properties, as demonstrated in applications to GANs, reinforcement learning, and computational geometry.
In the second part of the talk, we show that the conditional near-independence properties of smooth Gaussian processes imply the near-sparsity of Cholesky factors of dense kernel matrices. We use this insight to derive simple, fast solvers with state-of-the-art complexity vs. accuracy guarantees for general elliptic differential- and integral equations. Our methods come with rigorous error estimates, are easy to parallelize, and show good performance in practice.
Bio: I am a PhD-candidate in applied and computational mathematics at Caltech, advised by Houman Owhadi. Before coming to Caltech, I obtained my Bachelor’s– and Master’s degrees in mathematics at the University of Bonn. My research combines ideas from game theory, statistical inference, and applied mathematics to solve problems in computational science and engineering.

SCS Seminar Talk: Kexin Rong
TITLE: Prioritizing Computation and Analyst Resources in Large-scale Data Analytics
ABSTRACT:
Data volumes are growing exponentially, fueled by an increased number of automated processes such as sensors and devices. Meanwhile, the computational power available for processing this data – as well as analysts’ ability to interpret it – remain limited. As a result, database systems must evolve to address these new bottlenecks in analytics. In my work, I ask: how can we adapt classic ideas from database query processing to modern compute- and analyst-limited data analytics?In this talk, I will discuss the potential for this kind of systems development through the lens of several practical systems I have developed. By drawing insights from database query optimization, such as pushing workload- and domain-s pecific filtering, aggregation, and sampling into core analytics workflows, we can dramatically improve the efficiency of analytics at scale. I will illustrate these ideas by focusing on two systems — one designed for high-volume seismic waveform analysis and one designed to optimize visualizations for streaming infrastructure and application telemetry — both of which have been field-tested at scale. I will also discuss lessons from production deployments at companies including Datadog, Microsoft, Google and Facebook

Title: Building the Next-Generation AI: Small and Efficient Neural Computing
Abstract:
Deep learning has changed the computing paradigm. Today, AI researchers & practitioners increasingly use deep neural networks for many applications across different modalities and areas such as NLP, Vision, Speech, Conversational and Multimodal AI. However, much of the Deep Learning revolution has been limited to the Cloud and highly specialized hardware. Recently the AI community has witnessed an increasing trend for training larger and larger neural models (e.g., GPT-3, T5, BERT) that achieve state-of-the-art results but require enormous computation, memory and energy resources on the Cloud. In order to enable AI experiences in real-time across all users and devices, ML models have to run efficiently on the Cloud and personal devices on the Edge (e.g., mobile phones, wearables, IoT) which have limited computing capabilities.
In this talk, I will introduce our work on Neural Projection computing, an efficient AI paradigm, and a family of efficient Projection Neural Network architectures that yield fast (e.g., quadratic speedup for transformer networks) and tiny models that shrink memory requirements by upto 10000x while achieving near state-of-the-art performance powering vision and NLP applications on billions of mobile devices. Widespread increase in availability of connected “smart” appliances (e.g., conversational assistants) means that there is an ever-expanding surface area for mobile intelligence and ambient devices in homes. Our approach enables efficient ML to solve complex prediction tasks for such applications both on-device and on Cloud, keeping model size, compute and power usage low while simultaneously optimizing for accuracy.

Title: Multi-scale Human Behavior Modeling with Heterogeneous Data
Abstract:
In this era of big data, massive data are generated from heterogeneous resources every day, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for deepening our understanding of complex human behaviors. Modeling human behaviors requires robust computational methods that can not only capture semantics and useful insights from sparse and heterogeneous data, but also unravel sophisticated human behaviors at different scales. Besides, the enormous data velocity and the unparalleled scale of deep models also pose significant challenges to efficiency. In this talk, I will demonstrate a collection of research results that systematically improve the ecosystem of human behavior modeling based on representation learning. I will present practical representation learning for heterogeneous data in various settings, and show how these representation learning methods actually fill a niche to comfortably model different behaviors with atomic, compositional, and explainable operations. Finally, I will discuss how the theory of human behaviors may conversely benefit machine learning algorithms.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Krystina Madej -- Bringing Narrative Authoring into Social Media
Abstract:
When social media is perceived only as a vehicle for posting personal history narratives the potential for using its affordances to create literary narratives is lost. We can use social media’s speculative spaces to both create and experience a wide range of interactive and collaborative stories, both non-fiction and fiction. In 2009 The Royal Opera House used Twitter to crowd source Twitterdammerung, a collaborative venture to explore opera as a living art form and make it accessible to everyone. This inspired the Neil Gaiman book Hearts, Keys and Puppetry, a Twitter collaboration published as a BBC Audiobook, also in 2009. In 2014, Grammerly used its blog to crowd-source the book Frozen by Fire from 500 writers in 54 different countries. Crowdsourcing has become common for entertainment platforms such as Netfllix and a new generation of users has higher expectation of helping to shape online stories. High profile narrative experiments notwithstanding, the digital humanities continue to view social media most often as a vehicle for personal histories. This paper presents an ongoing social media and narrative project initiated in 2013 that encourages the broader perspective. It presents social media narratives created in 2019 by small teams of university students who were asked to engage in participatory story creation that used social media in all its affordances. Planning was through social media, content creation was through social media, and the narrative was played out through social media from Instant Messaging to Tweets, from Facebook to LinkedIn, from YouTube to Snap Chat. Students created their own non-fiction narratives (Atlanta Child Murders), explored contemporary fiction (The Handmaid’s Tale), and revisited canonical works (Romeo and Juliet) in ways that reflected their current media culture. One response to Romeo and Juliet shows the value of just such an approach, “I’ve never really connected to the story until now that I’ve seen how it plays out in apps I use every day.”
Speaker Bio:
Dr. Krystina Madej is Professor of the Practice at Georgia Tech in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication. She researches and teaches about how humans have adapted their narratives to changing media throughout the centuries, Disney's approach to stories across media since the 1920s, and physical play and children's interaction with narrative-based digital games. Her books include Interactivity, Collaboration, and Authoring in Social Media, Physical Play and Children’s Digital Games, and the edited book Engaging Imagination and Developing Creativity. A second edition of the co-authored book Disney Stories: Getting to Digital, first published in 2012, was released in November 2020.

SCS Seminar Talk: Ahmed Saeed
TITLE: Building Scalable Networks Stacks for Modern Applications
ABSTRACT:
The network stack in today's operating systems is a remnant from a time when a server had a handful of cores and processed requests from a few thousand clients. It simply cannot keep up with the scale of modern servers and the requirements of modern applications. Specifically, real-time applications and high user expectations enforce strict performance requirements on the infrastructure. Further, there is a fundamental shift in the way hardware capacity scales from simply relying on Moore's law to deliver faster hardware every couple of years to leveraging parallel processing and task-specific accelerators. This talk covers innovations in three key components of the network stack. First, I will cover my work on scalable packet scheduling in software network stacks, improving the control of traffic outgoing from large-scale servers. Second, I will move on to my work on improving overload control for servers handling microsecond-scale remote procedure calls, providing better control over incoming traffic to large-scale servers. Then, the talk covers my work on Wide Area Network (WAN) congestion control, focusing on network-assisted congestion control schemes, where end-to-end solutions fail. The talk will conclude with a discussion of plans for future research in this area.
BIO:
Saeed is a postdoctoral associate at MIT working with Professor Mohammad Alizadeh. His research interests broadly cover the theory, design, and implementation of scalable computer networks and systems, including resource scheduling, congestion control, wireless networks, and cyber-physical systems. Before joining MIT, Saeed received his Ph.D. in computer science from Georgia Tech, where he was advised by Professors Mostafa Ammar and Ellen Zegura. His Ph.D. was partially supported by the Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Systems and Networking. He received his bachelor's degree from Alexandria University in 2010.

SCS Seminar Talk: Praveen Kumar
TITLE: Towards Predictable Networks
ABSTRACT:
Fueled by evolving applications, requirements from systems and networks are changing in fundamental ways: networks today must provide increasingly strict performance guarantees and not just high performance. However, the design principles of the early Internet continue to be the basis of modern networks to provide best-effort performance. This leads to a mismatch between what applications need and what networks provide. To bridge this gap, we need predictability to be built into the design of networks.
In this talk, I will focus on the unique challenges and unprecedented opportunities for building predictable networks. I will first discuss this in the context of shared public clouds by presenting a new abstraction and system, PicNIC, for predictable network performance while navigating fundamental trade-offs. Then, I will expand the discussion with wide-area networks with a system to achieve efficiency and predictability. Finally, I will highlight research directions towards leveraging hardware support to build predictable networks in a scalable, robust, and efficient manner.
BIO:
Praveen Kumar is a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Cornell University. His research focuses on building predictable networks and takes a multi-disciplinary approach spanning architecture, PL, systems, and theory to build holistic networking solutions — from low-level hardware to high-level abstractions and algorithms. Kumar’s systems have been deployed at scale and also influenced the design of several other systems in production. His work has been recognized with a SIGCOMM best student paper award.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Kurtis Heimerl — Reclaiming the Internet: A Journey to Community-Held Cellular Infrastructure
Abstract:
Mobile network operators (MNOs) are a critical component of today’s Internet access landscape. Originally borne of wireline voice telephony access, innovations in wireless data connectivity (such as GPRS and LTE) have enabled these operators to become the world's dominant Internet providers, connecting more people to the Internet than wireline networks. However, the increasing centralization of the MNO ecosystem (down to just three providers in the US) is in contrast to the general design goals of the internet, which was built to allow multiple regional autonomous systems to work together to provide connectivity. In this talk we will discuss my group's ongoing attempts to leverage advances in wide area technology, specific open source LTE and NR, to recreate distributed access networks and help small organizations provide connectivity to their communities while still achieving the at-scale efficiencies of modern MNOs. This journey starts with an MNO partnership for GSM networks in the rural Philippines and continues in our current work with local NGOs on urban NR infrastructure.
Speaker Bio:
Kurtis Heimerl is an assistant professor of Computer Science at the University of Washington working on Information and Communication Technology and International Development (ICTD), specifically universal Internet access. Before that, he received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, working under Professors Eric Brewer and Tapan Parikh. Kurtis cofounded Endaga, which joined Facebook in 2015 and has also published widely, including top conferences such as ICTD, CSCW, CHI, MobiCom, and NSDI. He was a recipient of the 2014 MIT “35 under 35” award, the 2018 UW early career Diamond Award, and has won paper awards at CHI, NSDI, COMPASS, ASSETS, and DySPAN.

SCS Seminar Talk: Manuel Rigger
TITLE: Robustifying Data-Centric Systems
ABSTRACT:
Data is eating the world. Systems for storing and processing data, such as database
management systems (DBMSs), are thus pivotal for our computing infrastructure. It is critical
that they function correctly — incorrectly computed results (e.g., by omitting a row) can cause
serious loss or damage. Despite their importance, finding such logic bugs in production DBMSs is a longstanding challenge. This talk presents novel, general approaches to effectively detecting logic bugs in DBMSs by tackling the test oracle problem, i.e., deciding whether the returned result for a query is correct. These approaches were realized as the SQLancer open-source tool, which was evaluated on widely-used, production-quality DBMSs, such as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. To date, SQLancer has found over 450 unique previously unknown bugs in these systems, most of which have been fixed by the developers. This body of work has provided solid methodological and technical bases for effectively testing DBMSs and has already been widely adopted by industry. Many reliability challenges remain, not only for DBMSs, but also for other data-centric systems. The heterogeneous landscape in this space provides an exciting, fertile ground for new, practically relevant research for improving the reliability and performance of our society’s data processing infrastructure
BIO:
Manuel Rigger is a postdoctoral researcher in the Advanced Software Technologies (AST)
Lab at ETH Zurich, mentored by Zhendong Su. His research goal is to make software more
reliable by developing practical and principled approaches to tackle important challenges related to correctness, performance, and security. He draws on and contributes to the software engineering, systems, programming languages, and compilers fields. His recent work has focused on automatically testing database management systems, and led to over 450 unique bugs in widely-used systems such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, TiDB, and CockroachDB being discovered, most of which have been fixed. He completed his Ph.D. at Johannes Kepler University Linz, mentored by Hanspeter Mössenböck, and worked on the safe and efficient execution of unsafe languages (project Sulong). Part of this work was integrated into Oracle’s GraalVM to support its execution of LLVM IR.

SCS Seminar Talk: Caroline Lemieux
TITLE: Expanding the Reach of Fuzzing
ABSTRACT:
Software bugs are pervasive in modern software. As software is integrated into increasingly many aspects of our lives, these bugs have increasingly severe consequences, both from a security (e.g. Cloudbleed, Heartbleed, Shellshock) and cost standpoint. Fuzzing refers to a set of techniques that automatically find bug-triggering inputs by sending many random-looking inputs to the program under test. In this talk, I will discuss how, by identifying core under-generalized components of modern fuzzing algorithms, and building algorithms that generalize or tune these components, I have expanded the application domains of fuzzing. First, by building a general feedback-directed fuzzing algorithm, I enabled fuzzing to consistently find performance and resource consumption errors. Second, by developing techniques to maintain structure during mutation, I brought fuzzing exploration to “deeper” program states. Third, by decoupling the user-facing abstraction of random input generators from their sampling distributions, I built faster validity fuzzing and even tackled program synthesis. Finally, I will discuss the key research problems that must be tackled to make fuzzing readily-available and useful to all developers.
BIO:
Caroline Lemieux is a final-year Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley, advised by Koushik Sen. Her research aims to help developers improve the correctness, security, and performance of large, existing software systems, ranging from complex open-source projects to industrial-scale software. Her current projects tackle these goals with a focus on fuzz testing and program synthesis. Her work on fuzz testing has been awarded an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award, ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Artifact Award, ACM SIGSOFT Tool Demonstration Award, and Best Paper Award (Industry Track). Before Berkeley, she received her B.Sc. in combined honours computer science and mathematics at the University of British Columbia, where she won the Governor General’s Silver Medal in Science (highest standing in the Faculty of Science). She is the recipient of a Berkeley Fellowship for Graduate Study and a Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Programming Technologies and Software Engineering.

ML@GT Virtual Seminar: Csaba Szepesvari, University of Alberta
ML@GT invites you to a virtual seminar featuring Csaba Szepesvari from the University of Alberta. Please check back soon for additional information
Hardness of MDP planning with linear function approximation
Markov decision processes (MDPs) is a minimalist framework to capture that many tasks require long-term plans and feedback due to noisy dynamics. Yet, as a result MDPs lack structure and as such planning and learning in MDPs with the typically enormous state and action spaces is strongly intractable; no algorithm can avoid Bellman's curse of dimensionality in the worst case. However, as recognized already by Bellman and his co-workers at the advent of our field, for many problem of practical interest, the optimal value function of an MDP is well approximated by just using a few basis functions, such as those that are standardly used in numerical calculations. As knowing the optimal value function is essentially equivalent to knowing how to act optimally, one hopes that this observation can be turned into efficient algorithms as there are only a few coefficients to compute. If this is possible, we can think of the resulting algorithms as performing computations with a compressed form of the value functions. While many algorithms have been proposed as early as in the 1960s, until recently not much has been known about whether these compressed computations are possible and when. In this talk, I will discuss a few recent results (some positive, some negative) that are concerned with these compressed computations and conclude with some open problems. As we shall see, still today, there are more open questions than questions that have been satisfactorily answered.
About Csaba
Csaba Szepesvari is a Canada CIFAR AI Chair, the team-lead for the “Foundations” team at DeepMind and a Professor of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. He earned his PhD in 1999 from Jozsef Attila University, in Szeged, Hungary. He has authored three books and over 200 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers. He serves as the action editor of the Journal of Machine Learning Research and Machine Learning, as well as on various program committees. Dr. Szepesvari's interest is artificial intelligence (AI) and, in particular, principled approaches to AI that use machine learning. He is the co-inventor of UCT, a widely successful Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. UCT ignited much work in AI, such as DeepMind's AlphaGo which defeated the top Go professional Lee Sedol in a landmark game. This work on UCT won the 2016 test-of-time award at ECML/PKDD.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Laura Devendorf — Designing Not Knowing
Abstract:
As a design researcher and educator working in human-computer interaction, I often find myself in the business of "empowering" students by teaching them design. As a professor, I write grant proposals that use the magic of design to bring forth preferable futures. Yet, within the present socio-environ-political context, I find myself increasingly conflicted by these claims and asking myself, what, really, can design do? I will not be able to answer any of these questions during this talk because I don't know, but I will argue that the position of not-knowing, humility, and non-expert is useful for critically reflecting on the relevance of our practices. I will present ways that myself, collaborators, and the students with whom I work have been using weaving (sometimes with circuits, some without) as a practice through which to to try to probe, question, and understand what counts as design and the kinds of narratives we must take on in order to be "designers." I aim for this talk to inspire reflection and offer a few tactics for unknowing in order to think otherwise.
Speaker Bio:
Laura Devendorf is an assistant professor in Information Science and the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder. Her research questions the role of design and making in the wake of increasingly pressing global challenges. She directs the Unstable Design Lab where she works closely with students across engineering, information science, and art to speculate on alternative futures for technology. The lab currently focuses on weaving smart textiles and how themes of slowness, presence, and material negotiation can be used as both a practice and metaphor to formulate these visions. She earned bachelors' degrees in studio art and computer science from the University of California Santa Barbara before earning her Ph.D. at UC Berkeley School of Information. Her research has been featured on National Public Radio and has received multiple best paper awards at top conferences in the field of human-computer interaction.

SCS Seminar Talk: Ankush Das
TITLE: Programming Language Principles for Distributed Systems
ABSTRACT:
With the proliferation of distributed systems, the design of safe, secure, and efficient software has become an ever more complex task. The heterogeneous nature of these distributed systems have further introduced domain-specific programming requirements such as programming in an adversarial setting and inferring execution cost. Recognizing these requirements, my research has focused on advancing programming languages to support developers with program verification techniques, complexity analysis tools, and domain-specific languages.
In this talk, I focus on the domain of smart contracts, i.e., programs that enforce digital transactions, often legal or financial, between multiple parties. Programming smart contracts comes with its unique challenges, which include enforcing protocols of interaction, analyzing execution cost, and tracking linear assets. To address these challenges, the talk introduces Nomos, a programming language for smart contracts. To express and enforce protocols, Nomos is based on session types rooted in linear logic. To predict execution cost, Nomos uses resource-aware session types and automatic amortized resource analysis, a type-based technique for inferring cost bounds. To track assets, Nomos employs a linear type system that prevents assets from being duplicated or discarded.
The talk concludes with my future plans on exploring how programming languages can aid in the synthesis of smart contracts, verification of cryptographic protocols, and analysis of probabilistic systems with applications in artificial intelligence.
BIO:
Ankush Das is a final-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University. He is advised by Professor Jan Hoffmann and closely works with Professor Frank Pfenning. He is broadly interested in programming languages with a specific focus on program verification, complexity analysis, and domain-specific languages. He is the lead designer and developer of Nomos, a programming language for smart contracts rooted in resource-aware session types. He has also designed the Rast language based on refinement session types that won the best system description paper award at FSCD 2020. Before joining CMU, he worked as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, India where he designed static analysis and verification tools for Windows driver modules. He completed his undergraduate at IIT Bombay, India in 2014 where he worked on deciding termination of linear loop programs.

SCS Seminar Talk: Aditi Raghunathan
TITLE: Rethinking the Role of Data in Robust Machine Learning
ABSTRACT:
Despite notable successes on several carefully controlled benchmarks, current machine learning (ML) systems are remarkably brittle, raising serious concerns about their deployment in safety-critical applications like self-driving cars and predictive healthcare. In this talk, I discuss fundamental obstacles to building robust ML systems and develop principled approaches that form the foundations of robust ML. In particular, I will focus on the role of data and demonstrate the need to question common assumptions when improving robustness to (i) adversarial examples and (ii) spurious correlations. On the one hand, I will describe how and why naively using more data can surprisingly hurt performance in these settings. On the other hand, I will show that unlabeled data, when harnessed in the right fashion, is extremely beneficial and enables state-of-the-art robustness. In closing, I will discuss how to build on the foundations of robust ML and achieve wide-ranging robustness in various domains including natural language processing and vision.
BIO:
Aditi Raghunathan is a fifth-year Ph.D. student at Stanford University advised by Percy Liang. She is interested in building robust machine learning systems with guarantees for trustworthy real-world deployment. Her research in robustness has been recognized by a Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Machine Learning and the Open Philanthropy AI Fellowship. Among other honors, she is also the recipient of the Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship and the Stanford School of Engineering Fellowship.

Title: New Advances in (Adversarially) Robust and Secure Machine Learning
Abstract: Deep learning models are often vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this talk, we will focus on robustness and security of machine learning against adversarial examples. There are two types of defenses against such attacks: 1) empirical and 2) certified adversarial robustness.
In the first part of the talk, we will see the foundation of our winning system, TRADES, in the NeurIPS’18 Adversarial Vision Challenge in which we won 1st place out of 400 teams and 3,000 submissions. Our study is motivated by an intrinsic trade-off between robustness and accuracy: we provide a differentiable and tight surrogate loss for the trade-off using the theory of classification-calibrated loss. TRADES has record-breaking performance in various standard benchmarks and challenges, including the adversarial benchmark RobustBench, the NLP benchmark GLUE, the Unrestricted Adversarial Examples Challenge hosted by Google, and has motivated many new attacking methods powered by our TRADES benchmark.
In the second part of the talk, to equip empirical robustness with certification, we study certified adversarial robustness by random smoothing. On one hand, we show that random smoothing on the TRADES-trained classifier achieves SOTA certified robustness when the perturbation radius is small. On the other hand, when the perturbation is large, i.e., independent of inverse of input dimension, we show that random smoothing is provably unable to certify L_infty robustness for arbitrary random noise distribution. The intuition behind our theory reveals an intrinsic difficulty of achieving certified robustness by “random noise based methods”, and inspires new directions as potential future work.
Bio: Hongyang Zhang is a Postdoc fellow at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, hosted by Avrim Blum and Greg Shakhnarovich. He obtained his Ph.D. from CMU Machine Learning Department in 2019, advised by Maria-Florina Balcan and David P. Woodruff. His research interests lie in the intersection between theory and practice of machine learning, robustness and AI security. His methods won the championship or ranked top in various competitions such as the NeurIPS’18 Adversarial Vision Challenge (all three tracks), the Unrestricted Adversarial Examples Challenge hosted by Google, and the NeurIPS’20 Challenge on Predicting Generalization of Deep Learning. He also authored a book on machine learning and computer vision in 2017.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Christina Harrington — The Future is Collectivism: Exploring Technology Co-Design From a Lens of Critical Design
Abstract:
The question of who gets to contribute to design futures and technology innovation is an important topic across design and computing fields. This conversation has grave implications for communities that often find themselves an afterthought in technology design, and who coincidentally could benefit most from technological interventions in response to societal oppression. As human-computer interaction continues to frame the intersection of people and technology through a lens of access and humanity, it’s important to consider methods and approaches to computing that are inclusive and equitable, and consider culture and identity as components of interactions. Community-based participatory design allows us to engage those at the margins in design and also considers collectivism as a meaningful approach to speculating community and technology futures. I explore concepts of community collectivism as a way to address challenges of health and racial equity, employing critical theory and frameworks that may better engage marginalized groups. From this talk I hope to build upon the conversation of Who Gets to Future?, and explore recommendations for more equitable technology futures.
Speaker Bio:
As a designer and qualitative researcher, Dr. Christina Harrington focuses on understanding and conceptualizing technology experiences that support health and racial equity among marginalized groups. Her research as the Director of the Equity and Health Innovations Design Research Lab explores ways to employ design as a catalyst for health equity and socially responsible technology experiences. She explores concepts such as health, social acceptance, and collectivism through community-based participatory design and co-creation, engaging critical design and sociotechnical computing. Through participatory research methods she explores constructs of empowerment and access in design among vulnerable communities that have been marginalized along multiple dimensions of identity (age, race, ethnicity, income, class). Dr. Harrington is an Assistant Professor in the College of Computing and Digital Media at DePaul University and received her PhD from Georgia Tech’s College of Design.

SCS Seminar Talk: Maria Apostolaki
TITLE: Building Secure Distributed Systems atop the Insecure Internet
ABSTRACT:
Distributed systems are increasingly important for our everyday life, allowing for high performance, fault tolerance, and flexibility. Many of these systems nowadays rely on the inherently insecure internet infrastructure. Surely though, they should have been designed to take this into account?
In this talk, I will answer negatively to this question using a concrete example: public blockchain systems such as Bitcoin. These are novel distributed systems that are designed according to stringent failure models. In this context, I will explain how an adversary controlling pieces of Internet infrastructure can practically compromise: (i) Bitcoin’s consensus protocol (by partitioning the network); (ii) Bitcoin’s anonymity guarantees (by mapping pseudonyms to real-world identities); and (iii) Bitcoin’s availability (by eclipsing clients).
While these attacks are worrying, I will also introduce practical and effective defenses to counter them both at the network and the application layer. Beyond Bitcoin, this work teaches essential lessons for distributed-system design.

Title: Unraveling the interplay of the Urban form and Mobility Science for Planning Cities
Abstract: The marketing rhetoric around Smart Cities have left some unfulfilled promises when facing sustainability and social well being. Yet, ubiquitous data collection (including mobile devices, GPS, social media, and synoptic video) require new capabilities of computation to disrupt the field of urban planning.
In the first part of my talk, I present one example of how to use big-data to support urban planning decisions in the covid19 era. Via mobile phone data for twenty cities around the world, we study how the distance covered by individuals (rg) varies as the location of their residences moves away from the central business district (CBD). We show that the changes in the statistical distribution of rg between the inner city and the residents of the suburbs classify the centrality of cities better than the population distributions alone. In turn, we propose metrics of urban form and mobility based on rg to predict the infective reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 in eleven Spanish cities. In the second part I show A new urban planning paradigm where, within minutes, inhabitants can access their basic living needs by bike or by foot. In this work, we present novel insights of the interplay between the distributions of facilities and population that maximize accessibility over the existing road networks. Results in six cities reveal that travel costs could be reduced in half through redistributing facilities. In the optimal scenario, the average travel distance can be modeled as a functional form of the number of facilities and the population density
Bio: Marta Gonzalez is an Associate Professor both in City and Regional Planning and Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. She also holds a Physics Research faculty position in the Energy Technology Area (ETA) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). Gonzalez works in the urban science space, with a focus on the intersections between people within social networks and the built and natural environments. Her goal is to design urban solutions through new technologies. To that end, she has developed tools that impact transportation research and discovered novel approaches to model human mobility and the adoption of energy technologies. Her scientific approach is informed by the statistical physics of complex systems and network science. Gonzalez’s research includes the application of big data to understanding human network behavior, with applications in transportation networks, energy efficiency planning and characterization of disease proliferation. Gonzalez was a Scientific Advisory Board member of PTV AG. She was the recipient of a U.N. Foundation award to study consumption patterns of women and girls in the developing world and of a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation award to study access to financial services in the developing world.

SCS & ECE Recruiting Seminar: Akshitha Sriraman
TITLE: Enabling Hyperscale Web Services
ABSTRACT:
Current hardware and software systems were conceived at a time when we had scarce compute and memory resources, limited quantity of data and users, and easy hardware performance scaling due to Moore’s Law. These assumptions are not true today. Today, emerging web services require data centers that scale to hundreds of thousands of servers, i.e., hyperscale, to efficiently process requests from billions of users. In this new era of hyperscale computing, we can no longer afford to build each layer of the systems stack separately. Instead, we must rethink the synergy between the software and hardware worlds from the ground up.
In this talk, I will focus on re-thinking (1) software threading and concurrency paradigms and (2) data center hardware architectures. First, I will describe μTune, my software threading framework that is aware of the overheads induced by the underlying hardware’s constraints. Then, I will discuss SoftSKU and Accelerometer—my proposals to answer the question of: How should we build data center hardware for emerging software paradigms in the post-Moore era? Finally, I will conclude by describing my ongoing and future research towards re-designing the systems stack to enable the hyperscale web services of tomorrow.
BIO:
Akshitha Sriraman is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. Her research bridges computer architecture and software systems, demonstrating the importance of that bridge in realizing efficient hyperscale web services via solutions that span the systems stack. Her systems solutions to improve hardware efficiency have been deployed in real hyperscale data centers and currently serve billions of users, saving millions of dollars and meaningfully reducing the global carbon footprint. Additionally, her hardware design proposals have influenced Intel’s Alder Lake+ CPU architectures.
Sriraman has been recognized with a Facebook Fellowship, a Rackham Merit Ph.D. Fellowship, and was selected for the Rising Stars in EECS Workshop. Her work has been recognized with an IEEE Micro Top Picks distinction and has appeared in top architecture and systems venues like OSDI, ISCA, ASPLOS, MICRO, and HPCA.

You can lead a horse to water...: Representing vs. Using Features in Neural NLP
Abstract
A wave of recent work has sought to understand how pretrained language models work. Such analyses have resulted in two seemingly contradictory sets of results. On one hand, work based on "probing classifiers" generally suggests that SOTA language models contain rich information about linguistic structure (e.g., parts of speech, syntax, semantic roles). On the other hand, work which measures performance on linguistic "challenge sets" shows that models consistently fail to use this information when making predictions. In this talk, I will present a series of results that attempt to bridge this gap. Our recent experiments suggest that the disconnect is not due to catastrophic forgetting nor is it (entirely) explained by insufficient training data. Rather, it is best explained in terms of how "accessible" features are to the model following pretraining, where "accessibility" can be quantified using an information-theoretic interpretation of probing classifiers.
About Ellie
Ellie Pavlick is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Brown University where she leads the Language Understanding and Representation (LUNAR) Lab. She received her PhD from the one-and-only University of Pennsylvania. Her current work focuses on building more cognitively-plausible models of natural language semantics, focusing on grounded language learning and on sample efficiency and generalization of neural language models.

Title: Learning like a Human: Curriculum inspired by Learning Dynamics
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) can surpass humans on certain complicated yet specific tasks, given well-processed data. However, most ML methods treat samples/tasks equally during the course of training, e.g., by taking a random batch per step and repeating many epochs' SGD on all data, which is extraordinarily suboptimal and inefficient from human perspectives, since we would never teach children or students in such a way. On the contrary, human learning is more strategic in selecting or generating the training contents via experienced teachers, collaboration, curiosity/diversity-driven exploration, tracking of memorization, sub-tasking, etc., which have been underexplored in ML. In addition, most of them can be encoded into the selection and schedule of data/tasks during learning, which is another type of intelligence as important as model optimization. A key observation from human learning is that the learning history can indicate the most informative examples/tasks to learn in the future.
In this talk, I will present curricula built upon training dynamics that can substantially improve ML in the wild, e.g., supervised/semi-supervised/self-supervised learning, robust learning with noisy labels, reinforcement learning, ensemble learning, etc., when the data are imperfect and a curriculum can make a big difference. Firstly, we build both empirical and theoretical connections between curriculum learning and the training dynamics of ML models. Our empirical studies show that deep neural networks are fast in memorizing some data but also fast in forgetting some others. Hence, we can accurately allocate those easily forgotten data by earlier-stage training dynamics and make the future training mainly focus on them. Moreover, we find that the consistency of model output overtime for an unlabeled sample indicates its pseudo-label's correctness in self-supervised learning and predicts the future forgetfulness on learned data. These discoveries are in line with human learning and combining them leads to more efficient and smarter curricula for a rich class of ML problems. Theoretically, we study how to find a curriculum that can optimize the training dynamics over a data distribution in continuous time. Interestingly, the theoretically derived curriculum matches our empirical strategies and has an insightful interpretation with the tangent/path kernel from deep learning theories. Secondly, I will give you some examples of human curriculum strategies that are effective on ML. I will show you how to translate them to discrete-continuous optimizations that can be solved efficiently. Lastly, I will discuss future directions and potential applications for healthcare, transportation, banking, scientific discovery, social good, etc.

SCS Seminar Talk: Matteo Brucato
TITLE: Package Queries: Scalable Prescriptive Analytics Close to the Data
ABSTRACT:
Decision making is central to a broad range of domains, including finance, transportation, healthcare, the travel industry, robotics, and engineering. It is often found at the very final step of business analytics--prescriptive analytics--to allow businesses to transform a rich understanding of data, typically provided by advanced predictive models, into actionable decisions. Modeling and solving these problems have relied on application-specific solutions, which are often complex, error-prone, and not generalizable. My goal is to create a domain-independent, declarative approach, supported and powered by the system where the data relevant to these problems typically resides: the database. Despite the widespread importance of prescriptive analytics, unified solutions close to the data did not exist.In my talk, I will present a prototype system that supports package queries, a new query modelthat extends traditional database queries to handle complex constraints and preferences over answer sets. Package queries allow the declarative specification and efficient evaluation of a significant class of constrained optimization problems--integer programs--within a database. These queries pose unique challenges to a database system, ranging from their richer expressive power, more complex semantics, and harder computational complexity than their SQL counterpart, to scalability issues that arise from large amounts of data and uncertainty in the data. I will illustrate how our unified system addresses all these challenges achieving high performance and quality in many real-world problems from finance, healthcare, and science. I will also present my vision for data-centric systems for decision making, and their connections with robotics, machine learning, natural language processing, visualization, operations management, and simulation.

SCS Seminar Talk: Dylan Foster
TITLE: Bridging Learning and Decision Making
ABSTRACT:
Machine learning is becoming widely used in decision making, in domains ranging from personalized medicine and mobile health to online education and recommendation systems. While (supervised) machine learning traditionally excels at prediction problems, decision making requires answering questions that are counterfactual in nature, and ignoring this mismatch leads to unreliable decisions. As a consequence, our understanding of the algorithmic foundations for data-driven decision making is limited, and efficient algorithms are typically developed on an ad hoc basis. Can we bridge this gap and make decision making as easy as machine learning? Focusing on the contextual bandit, a core problem in data-driven decision making, we bridge the gap by providing the first optimal and efficient reduction to supervised machine learning. The algorithm allows users to seamlessly apply off-the-shelf supervised learning models and methods to make decisions on the fly, and has been implemented in widely-used, industry-standard tools for decision making. Our results advance a broader program to develop a universal algorithm design paradigm for data-driven decision making. I will close the talk by discussing challenges and opportunities in building such a framework, including efforts to extend our developments to difficult reinforcement learning problems in large state spaces.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Marshini Chetty — Imagine All The People On A Trustworthy Internet
Abstract:
Imagine a world where the Internet caters to all types of users and hosts trustworthy content. Right now, this world seems far off for many reasons. For instance, this world would require us to think more broadly of user needs beyond an `average’ tech-savvy adult user—one who is assumed to be always online with a reliable Internet connection. Moreover, this world would require us to host content that is not misleading or manipulative in some way—content that can be evaluated at face value by various users. To achieve this lofty goal, we first need to deeply understand and catalogue different types of Internet users’ needs and also develop ways to assess and make misleading online content more apparent to end-users.
In this talk, I will present a set of case studies from my research lab that helps further the goal of a trustworthy Internet for all. I will describe various projects geared at understanding a wide variety of Internet users’ needs for online privacy and security in different contexts from children to those in developing contexts. I will also describe work that provides empirical evidence of misleading content online such as `dark patterns’ and disguised advertisements and create solutions to help users to better evaluate this content. These case studies will demonstrate how important it is to study the privacy and security needs of those who do not fit the “average” user mold and demonstrate possible solutions for helping users gain more trust in information on the Internet. I conclude with open questions for imagining an Internet which is more trustworthy and inclusive to all people.

SCS Seminar Talk: Sahil Singla
TITLE: Algorithms and Uncertainty
ABSTRACT:
Modern algorithms have to regularly deal with uncertain inputs. This uncertainty can take many forms, e.g., in online advertisement future users are unknown (the input arrives online), in spectrum-auctions bidder valuations are unknown (the users are strategic), and in oil-drilling the amount of oil is unknown (the input is stochastic). Traditionally, there has not been significant overlap in the study of these different forms of uncertainty. I believe that studying these uncertainties together gives us a lot more power. In this talk, I will give an overview of my research in “Algorithms and Uncertainty” where I am able to successfully use these relationships.
Studying these different forms of uncertainty together allows us to find connections and build unifying techniques. As an example, I will talk about my progress on long-standing combinatorial auctions problems that deal with strategic inputs, by using techniques which were originally developed for online inputs. Moreover, a combined study of uncertainty helps us find richer cross-cutting models. For example, several important online problems do not admit good algorithms in the classical worst-case models. I will talk about how to give a “beyond the worst-case” analysis for such problems and obtain more nuanced performance guarantees, by using models/techniques arising in other forms of uncertainty.

SCS Seminar Talk: Marios Kogias
TITLE: Building Latency-Critical Datacenter Systems
ABSTRACT:
Online services play a major role in our everyday life for communication, entertainment, socializing, e-commerce, etc. These services run inside the datacenter under strict tail-latency service level objectives in order to remain interactive. The emergence of new hardware for IO has enabled microsecond-scale datacenter communications that challenge the efficiency of existing operating system and network mechanisms. Also, new in-network programmable devices start being deployed in datacenters and introduce a new computing paradigm that shifts functionality traditionally performed at the end-points to the network.
In this talk I will revisit the operating systems, networking, and distributed systems infrastructure specifically targeting latency-critical datacenter systems, while drawing intuition from basic queueing theory results. In the first part of the talk, I will focus on ZygOS[SOSP 2017], a system optimized for μs-scale, in-memory computing on multicore servers. ZygOS implements a work-conserving scheduler within a specialized operating system designed for high request rates and a large number of network connections. ZygOS revealed the challenges associated with serving remote procedure calls (RPCs) on top of a byte-stream oriented protocol, such as TCP. In the second part of the talk, I will present R2P2[ATC 2019]. R2P2 is a transport protocol specifically designed for datacenter RPCs, that exposes the RPC abstraction to the endpoints and the network, making RPCs first-class datacenter citizens. R2P2 enables pushing functionality, such as scheduling, fault-tolerance, and tail-tolerance, inside the transport protocol. I will show how using R2P2 allowed us to offload RPC scheduling to programmable switches that can schedule requests directly on individual CPU cores.
BIO:
Marios Kogias is a researcher at MSR Cambridge. He graduated from EPFL in August 2020. His main research focus is at the intersection of operating systems and networking in the datacenter. He’s working on building and understanding systems with strict tail-latency SLOs leveraging new emerging hardware. He was an IBM PhD Fellow and won the best student paper award at Eurosys2020. Before joining EPFL he got his undergrad degree from the National Technical University of Athens. He has interned at Cern, Google, and Microsoft Research

Generative models based on point processes for financial time series simulation
Abstract:
In this seminar, I will talk about generative models based on point processes for financial time series simulation. Specifically, we focus on a recently developed state-dependent Hawkes (sdHawkes) process to model the limit order book dynamics [Morariu-Patrichi, 2018]. The sdHawkes model consists of an oracle Hawkes process and a state process following Markov transition. The Hawkes and state processes are fully coupled, which enables the point process captures the self-and cross-excitation as well as the interaction between events and states. We will go through the model formulation in sdHawkes, the simulation of sdHawkes, its maximum likelihood estimation, and more importantly, its application to high-frequency data modeling that captures the interactions between the order flow and the state of the current market.

GVU Center Brown Bag: Silvia Lindtner — Prototype Nation: China and the Contested Promise of Innovation
Abstract:
How did China’s mass manufacturing and “copycat” production become transformed, in the global tech imagination, from something holding the nation back to one of its key assets? Prototype Nation offers a transnational analysis of how the promise of democratized innovation and entrepreneurial life has shaped China’s governance and global image. Lindtner reveals how a growing distrust in Western models of progress and development, including Silicon Valley and the tech industry after the financial crisis of 2007–8, shaped the rise of the global maker movement and the vision of China as a “new frontier” of innovation. Lindtner’s investigations draw on more than a decade of research in makerspaces, tech incubators, corporate offices, and factories. She examines how the ideals of the maker movement, to intervene in social and economic structures, served the technopolitical project of prototyping a “new” optimistic, assertive, and global China. In doing so, Lindtner demonstrates that entrepreneurial living influences governance, education, policy, investment, and urban redesign in ways that normalize the persistence of sexism, racism, colonialism, and labor exploitation. Prototype Nation shows that by attending to the bodies and sites that nurture entrepreneurial life, technology can be extricated from the seemingly endless cycle of promise and violence. **Get Prototype Nation now for 30% off with code P234 from the Princeton U Press website.**
Speaker Bio:
Silvia Lindtner (she/her) is an Associate Professor at the University of Michigan in the School of Information and Associate Director of the Center for Ethics, Society, and Computing (ESC). She is a founding member of Precarity Lab, a research collective working on various forms of insecurity, vulnerability, and social and cultural exclusion that digital platforms produce and mediate. She is the co-founder of the China research collective Hacked Matter, dedicated to critically investigating processes of technology innovation, urban design, and production cultures in China. Lindtner's research interests include cultures and politics of technology innovation and entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on the gendered and racialized forms of labor necessary to incubate entrepreneurial life and sustain technological promise. Lindtner draws from more than ten years of multi-sited ethnographic research, with a particular focus on China's shifting position in the global political economy of technology production, economic development, and science and technology policy. She is the author of Prototype Nation: China and the Contested Promise of Innovation (Princeton University Press, 2020). The book reveals how a growing distrust in Western models of progress and development, including Silicon Valley and the tech industry after the financial crisis of 2007–8, shaped the vision of China as a “new frontier” of innovation. Lindtner unpacks how this promise of entrepreneurial life has influenced governance, education, policy, investment, and urban redesign in ways that normalize the persistence of sexism and racist forms of violence and colonial logics of othering. Lindtner’s work contributes to the fields of STS (science and technology studies), cultural and feminist anthropology, China studies, HCI (human computer interaction), global communication studies, science and technology policy, and design. Her research has been awarded support from the US National Science Foundation, IMLS, Intel Labs, Google Anita Borg, and the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation.

SCS Seminar Talk: Zhao Song
TITLE: The Theory of Provable and Efficient Deep Learning
ABSTRACT:
Deep learning has fundamentally revolutionized our society, including recommendation systems that suggest movies and items to purchase, virtual assistants, and future autonomous vehicles. From a theoretical point of view, there are two main questions in deep learning: (1) understanding of why deep learning works, (2) how to speed the running time of deep learning algorithms. In this talk, I will provide progress for these two questions. First, I will show that stochastic gradient descent is able to memorize all the input data points under some mild assumptions. Second, I will present a new optimization algorithm for fast deep learning. The key observation is that stochastic gradient descent is an iterative algorithm, and gradients change slowly in each iteration. This observation allows us to update gradients in a lazy fashion, significantly improving per-iteration running time. Finally, I will briefly describe how to apply similar ideas to speed up convex optimization and quantum machine learning.

We are starting a collaboration between Digital Media and Public Policy that explores how gig workers’ labor is enmeshed with automation tools in Poshmark.com. Poshmark is an online reselling platform for secondhand fashion that offers a social retail model, like social media for secondhand clothes. This grant from IPAT and the GVU Center will allow us to carry out interviews with various workers that belong to the Poshmark ecosystem as sellers, as virtual assistants that fill the roles automation would otherwise do, or as the programmers that offer the automation tools. According to the company, most sellers and buyers are women in the U.S and Canada. As many other platforms of the gig economy, Poshmark has many sellers looking for supplemental income while others derive their earnings fully from their sales on the platform. The use of automation by the sellers is a complex issue because it is against Poshmark’s Terms of Service (ToS), yet the site design requires high amounts of tedious clicking and routine interaction to maintain product visibility. The interviews will allow us to better understand how the different resellers on Poshmark justify the use of automation and work along the boundaries of the ToS. We hope this will contribute to shedding light into the complex ways contemporary laborers are navigating a work landscape that increasingly includes automation.
Electrochromic Skin: Exploring the Design and Fabrication of Epidermal Displays for Somatic Data-Awareness. Sang Leigh (Industrial Design), W. Hong Yeo (Mechanical Engineering), Noah Posner (College of Design)
We explore an accessible and scalable fabrication method for soft printed displays—using a novel electrochromic material, PEDOT:PSS. The process could revolutionize existing forms of printed and wearable products; these include on-skin interfaces or textiles that can display digital information, and packagings, wallpapers or stickers that dynamically change their visual with minimal power consumption. We plan to deploy the technique in the form of a soft display microlab within the Interactive Product Design Lab (IPDL) at the College of Design, where students and researchers can create and customize printed displays using commercial inkjet printers and simple craft tools. We will explore various applications through design workshops involving students and researchers on campus, on the topics of epidermal health-tracking devices, smart packaging concepts for retail or food products, and apparels made with electrochromic textiles.
Healing Justice: Co-Designing for Black Communities. Susana Morris (LMC), Brooke Bosley (LMC)
During the summer of 2020, Black Americans faced a series of inequities from police brutality, to systemic racism, to COVID-19, all of which impacted Black communities at higher rates than other racial groups because of disparities in health and resources. Policies regarding defunding the police have been offered as solutions that could address racial inequity and injustice. Proponents of defunding legislation argue that reallocating funding from policing can allow funds to be reinvested in Black communities through entrepreneurship programs, mental health services, after school programs, and other resources that would offer community support. However, the language of defunding has faced much opposition, primarily because of misinformation and lack of clear explanation of what these policies truly mean for Black communities. As Black Media Studies Scholars, we seek to understand how this misinformation is trafficked on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Parler, and MeWe. The research project’s goals are threefold: to understand how proposed legislation on defunding the police tackles racial equity and justice, to analyze whether these defunding policies strengthen communities that are overpoliced (mainly Black neighborhoods), and to investigate how ideology online has impacted communities' perceptions around public safety.
COVID-19 and Child Maltreatment Through Two Different Lenses: Online Media and Official Administrative Reports. Diyi Yang (Interactive Computing), Lindsey Bullinger (Public Policy)
COVID-19 has profoundly changed all aspects of home and family life during most of 2020. Severe and sudden unemployment, school closures, and quarantining have created enormous challenges, particularly in the homes of children. Additional hardships may include public benefits office closures, limited hours for accessing essential services. These problems are also likely exacerbated among low-income families. Particularly in the lives of parents, social media plays a large role everyday life. For example, pre-pandemic, many parents used social networks and social media to exchange information, resources, and social support online. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the social distancing and lockdown orders have led to people spending even more time online. Given the current constraints with more traditional measures of child abuse and neglect (namely, fewer interactions with mandated reporters such as teachers), social media data can be leveraged to gain insight into how child well-being has fared during the pandemic. This research will combine social media data and administrative data on child maltreatment referrals to answer several research questions: (1) How has child exposure to violence changed during the COVID-19 pandemic according to social media data? (2) How do these online media data compare to administrative data on child maltreatment referrals? (3) How do these influences differ before and during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Developing a New Cellular-Based Sensor Platform for IoT/Smart Cities Projects. Russ Clark (Computer Science), Peter Presti (IMTC), Scott Gilliland (IMTC)
The networked LoRa-based processor board at the heart of the Sea Level Sensors Program has become a cornerstone of our IoT environmental sensing efforts. The field deployment and the data gathered is at the heart of a growing set of collaborations and projects across campus and in the community. Over the course of the project we have discovered a need for a low-powered cellular network-based sensor platform. The goal of this work is to develop this new cellular platform that will fill a gap in our current toolkit for new projects and collaborations across campus and community partners. The platform is designed to be easily modified, benefiting student projects and funded research alike. The resulting device will be customizable with a set of standardized off-the-shelf sensors to meet specific implementation requirements. Additionally, the targeted applications fit squarely in the UN sustainable development goals, especially that of Sustainable Cities and Communities, Good Health and Wellbeing, and Climate Action.
Going Pro: Bridging the Gap Between Georgia K-12 Students, STEM Education, and the E-Sports Industry. Laura Levy (IMTC), Sean Mulvanity (Bradwell Institute), Richard Catrambone (Psychology), Bryan Cox (GA Department of Education), Lien Diaz (Constellations Center)
Esports, or competitive video gaming, can be an effective way to motivate grade-school students in developing STEM skills and pursuing STEM fields. The most popular esports titles are team-based, placing high requirements on skills requiring communication, coordination, and compromise. Students excited by being a part of an esports team and community are likely to develop other skills, such as software and hardware engineering as well as web design and video editing, to supplement their play performance and contribute to their team in ways outside of playing the game. However, there remain barriers to entry for schools and students in implementing esports programs. While public sentiment on esports is changing for the positive, there can still be doubt and misunderstandings around the benefits for esports programs in school administrations, educators, parents, and students alike. Even for schools convinced by the beneficial impacts of esports programs, there can be confusion in how to navigate the evolving landscape of leagues, games, and equipment to purchase. Finally, and particularly for schools in rural Georgia, there is a lack of connection for schools and students with the state of the industry, which often manifests in misconceptions on what it means to pursue a STEM career in the games industry. This proposal focuses on rural and underserved communities in Georgia, to further the mission of service by Georgia Tech for educational outreach in the state. This project proposes a two part engagement with all virtual activities, to maintain safe best practices during COVID-19 while also maximizing our outreach to students that can benefit the most from this engagement but are located geographically far from Georgia Tech. Virtual interviews and focus groups with educators, students, and parents will inform the design and content of a virtual workshop with esports industry partners meant to help orient, educate, and provide resources for stakeholders across the state in the benefits and process of incorporating esports programs in K-12 schools.
Alone Together: Empowering Student Community Building and Content Engagement Through Digital Collaboration in Remote Learning. Laura Levy (IMTC), Anne Sullivan (LMC)
The landscape of education delivery has dramatically changed due to COVID-19 with students and instructors doing their best to adapt to virtual learning formats. The speed and extent of changes to remote instruction during COVID-19 have presented a number of challenges and, as a result, many students express feelings of disconnectedness and have difficulties engaging with material in a remote format. Additionally, virtual formats primarily rely on a narrow range of evaluative assessments that can prevent students from expressing full mastery of course material and magnify impacts of accessibility issues already existing in traditional classroom settings (e.g. access issues for students with cognitive or perceptual disabilities). Video conferencing can be intimidating for unconfident students or for those where English is not their primary language, and many students may not have stable enough internet connections to be able to use video, voice, or even know if what they are seeing is in real time. Therefore, we propose to identify and analyze existing digital tools and their best practices that can be adopted to improve students’ sense of community, increase course material engagement, and provide alternative ways to demonstrate mastery. This proposed work seeks to produce timely knowledge on platforms and practices that better support student course engagement and feelings of connectedness during remote education. While the impetus for this work is COVID-19, the outcomes of this work can be useful beyond the pandemic and we hypothesize that they will be generalizable to other forms of remote education and remote collaboration in the workforce.
